I'm on call twenty-four hours a day now. It's not the greatest thing in the world but it pays the bills, and sometimes they let me leave early or take extra days off if I'm tired. There's not that much going on at night of course but occasionally one of us has to run out and deal with something. An animal sighting, a missing person, drunk people shooting each other, that sort of thing. All in all, I get called out about a dozen times a month for some kind of night-time emergency. Generally, the calls go something like this:

A text and a phone call from my boss. Fifteen minutes to get out the door dressed in my uniform. Thirty to work, then anywhere from five minutes to eight hours dealing with the issue. If it's a missing person or the cops are involved, up to two days without sleep. The worst was a murder-suicide. That took a week. By the end of it I was in the hospital with severe fatigue and dehydration.

My boss knows I'll pick up as soon as he calls, but I don't always hear texts. Usually he'll text first in case I'm up, but otherwise he'll get me on the phone. He is the only one who contacts me in this situations. That's always been our system in the past. So you can imagine my surprise when I got a call from him at two in the morning and saw I had seventy, seven-zero, missed texts from just about every single person in our department.

"Yeah, what's up?" I said, sitting up. I'm great at faking being awake on the phone.

"Cleetwood Trail, south entrance. It's bad. Don't worry about your clothes, just get out there." He was breathing heavy and he didn't wait for me to finish my greeting.

"What's up?" I was concerned now. My boss is unflappable.

"Just get out there. It's bad."

Of course I immediately thought of the murder-suicide. It took us days to find all the pieces of their skulls. "How bad?"

"K.D is on her way. Call when you've figured it out." He hung up.

He'd never sent another Ranger up before me. I scrolled through the barrage of texts.

*omg russ what the hell is going on?*

*Dude what the fuck*

*i'm sorry*

*whats going on out there???*

*CALL ME*

*CALL (BOSS' NAME) RIGHT NOW OMG*

I threw my clothes on and was out the door in about five minutes. The drive took about fifteen minutes going ninety on the freeway and along the way my phone kept pinging notifications. I turned it off and tossed it in the back seat.

When I got there K.D was waiting for me. Something about her face was wrong and in the non-existent light I had to get close to her to see that she was wearing a respirator. The smell was like a wall. I ran into it about five feet from her and gagged. I took the respirator she handed me and strapped it on, coughing and doubled over.

"Bad, huh?" She quipped, her voice muffled. She patted me on the back. "C'mon."

I followed her into the forest and even behind the filters I could still smell it. Believe me, it bothers me as much as it does anyone else when people say that something is 'indescribable' but I really do not know how to paint an accurate picture of what it was like. Imagine taking a fish and filling it full of other dead fish. Put the stuffed fish in a bag made out of the skin of even more dead fish and leave the bag sitting in the sun for a few days. Sprinkle some halitosis and rotting grass on top of the bag, let it sit another few days. Now open the bag and stick your head in and take a nice big breath. That should give you an idea of what it was like from half a mile away.

It was hard to be heard through the respirators so we didn't talk much while we walked. Neither of us really wanted our mouths open anyway. I kept thinking about how smells are composed of particulate and a few times I had to stop and lift the respirator to spit and dry heave. K.D clapped me on the back, almost knocking me off balance and sending my spit flying.

"Gross, huh?" She said, half-shouting. "Don't worry, it's only worse from here."

I gave her a weak thumbs-up and we kept going.

She'd taken the van with our on-site equipment inside, and she'd been there long enough to have carted a couple of portable spotlights to the scene. As we crested a hill, I could see them shining on something. Something huge. The top of the thing crested out of the trees in places, a huge grey behemoth. I shot her a look but she just grinned and waved me ahead. The smell was thick enough now to almost be visible and something crunched under my feet. The robin I'd crushed was still alive and it raised one wing weakly. I crushed its skull and moved on but there were others. They remained where they'd fallen, their sides heaving and an occasional wing raised and dropped.

"Smell got 'em, I think." K.D said, kicking a bird off the path. "There's a raccoon up here too. Took one bite and died. It was hilarious. Come look." I stepped around the birds and the light filtered through the trees, shining on their little oil-drop eyes. The path straightened and up ahead I could see that the hulking thing, whatever it was, had fallen right across it about three hundred yards ahead. I broke into a jog and K.D kept pace. I went as close as I could until the smell was too much, and then I just stood while K.D kept going. She kicked the thing and spread her arms out, taking it all in.

The way she'd illuminated it, only parts were really visible. It rose up, an impenetrable wall, and disappeared into the tops of the trees. The sporadic but careful lighting gave it an almost reverent quality, like an artifact on display. Either way I looked, the thing stretched into the dark. K.D walked the length of it to my right, until I could barely make her out in the dark. I craned my head up and could just see the edge, where it curved and dipped back down. I forced myself closer to the rubbery surface of the thing. It was greyish, darker in the light, and the surface was scarred and stippled with white marks. K.D came back and walked down to the left.

"C'mere!" She called. I followed, not taking my eyes off the thing.

We walked, kept walking, her hand sometimes brushing the thing, and up ahead now I could see something sticking out of the side of the wall.

"Know what it is now?" I could hear that she was grinning, enjoying the mystery.

It was some kind of thick flap, huge, bigger than both of us combined. One side was attached to the thing; it hung to the ground, where it rested in the dirt. At the place where the flap joined the wall, there were strange protrusions. Ignoring the smell now I looked closer. There were many of them, in various sizes. Small, grainy craters. That's when the pieces fit together and I backed off, stumbling over myself and almost falling into the dirt. K.D lifted the pectoral flipper with great effort.

"You imagine how strong they have to be to move these things? Wish it still had its tail."

I ran forward and kept going until above my head I could see something reflecting the light, just barely. Something liquid and glassy, just beginning to fog with bacteria and decay. The mouth was slightly open and the algae in the baleen was beginning to rot. Suddenly there was a loud, wheezing exhale and the thing moved, just slightly. The mouth opened showing more of the slimy, putrid baleen and from somewhere far down on the other end there was a creak, and a thud I felt rather than heard.

"Holy shit." K.D whispered. "Thought it died an hour ago. You feel that? It's still trying."

The milky eye moved too look at me and there was another, weaker exhale and as we stared at each other the whale opened its mouth a little more, closed it, and died. The light left the blind eye and the entire corpse sagged, letting off more of that horrific stench. K.D was still talking.

"It's another of those clean cuts. Right through the whole back of it. If you go around the other side it's missing that fin and a big slice of its skin. But the tail's totally gone."

I couldn't break away, couldn't stop looking into the cataract that was forming, all the bacteria now free to multiply and turn everything to liquid. Through the baleen I could just make out the bulk of the tongue and it was already losing color, already being eaten from the inside, and I ran as far away as I could before doubling over and vomiting. K.D came over and patted my back. When it was over, I wiped my mouth and put the respirator back on. Now I went back to the corpse and began walking the length of it, shutting off every light. I couldn't stand to see it lit so beautifully.

"I honestly don't even know who to call." K.D said.

Down at the other end I could see the clean slice, where the tail had been taken off. No boat propeller could have done it, but that was no surprise. I knew what had. I wondered how big they had been. Down there in the deepest dark, where only whales could go. It answered a theory I'd had for some time. The stairs were impartial. Deep down in my gut there was a glassy, obsidian panic that was so familiar now as to be unnoticeable except when more weight was added. Suddenly, more than anything, I wanted to be at home in the dark, and I told K.D who to call, what to do, so that I could hand her my respirator and begin the walk back to my truck. Never looking back at the corpse cresting the trees, the top of it growing its own forest of birds, feasting.

We'll leave it to rot. We'll say a water spout sucked up fish from one of the lakes and dumped them out there. When the bones are the only thing left, we'll dispose of them, and the trail will re-open.

I drove back home and went to bed.
