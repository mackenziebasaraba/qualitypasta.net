- he remembers and smiles
- he told me about a spirit called "Derk met den beer" (Derk with a Hog)
- says he is a protector of these woods and something about a old farmer beaing cursed for shooting a rivle at God on "Kerst Nacht" (Christmas Eve)
- he goes to the bookshelf to get an older leathery looking book with gold ornaments idk how to discribe it in english
- "Overijssels sagenboek" whas the titel on the cover
- a book with stories about local legends like dwarfs, water monsters and witches

- i say to my grandpa, "Thats a weird name for a god "Derk"
- he smiles
- thats not his real name anon, you cant speak his real name it will bring bad luck
- whats he called i sayd Voldemort i said smiling
- even just seeing the wild hunt is a bad omen
- my grandma hears my grandpa talking about the spirit
- she looks at us and says "wasnt he called Fro or Friej or something?"
- in one fleuent motion my grandpa jumps out of his chair and begins to raise his voice
- "You dont speak his name!"
- "What did i tell just now!"
- ofuck.jpg
- didnt know my grandpa whas this superstitious
- after he calms down i showed him the picture i took of the thing in the woods
- my grandpa is silent
- "he even has the spear" he mumbles after a minnute
- "what?"
- i take a closer look and you can almost make out a spear behind the figure
- "he misses a war horn" said grandpa
- "a horn?" i said
- he turns the page of the book and on it a real nice looking picture of a Germanic looking dude riding a hog
- he is blowing a horn
- "what does the horn do?" i ask
- get some vague awnser, someting along the lines of "It helps him hunt"

- couple of days later
- back home i do some Research on Derk/Fro
- turns out he whas like an old germanic god, elmost every germanic country has its own name for him
- in The Netherlands and Germany they call him Fro or Frey
- and in the Scandinavian countrys they called him Freyr
- god of fertility
- yeah the dude indeed looks like a real ladys man
- reading some information on the Tankenberg were i took the pictures
- there is a small pagan temple
- temple for some goddess named Tamfana
