&lt;p&gt;I let it go after a while. A few years passed, and in college I learned about this internet urban legend called &amp;ldquo;lost episodes.&amp;rdquo; People claimed to have seen episodes of TV shows or altered versions of movies, usually animated, that contained graphic and disturbing content. The episode or movie was often found in unexpected places, and those claiming to have seen it often said it mysteriously disappeared, whether through a VHS tape appearing to have somehow self-erased, a website going dead immediately after viewing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t put much stock in the validity of these stories, but with my &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; experience still in the back of my mind, I decided to look further into it. I found a YouTube channel called Cartoon Geek, who was discussing a certain &amp;ldquo;lost episode&amp;rdquo; for his 40 thousand subscriber special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through the obligatory thanks and talking about how much his subscribers meant to him and all that, he began: &amp;ldquo;Now for those of you who are new to this channel, I&amp;rsquo;m basically just a guy obsessed with all things nostalgic and geeky about cartoons and other media. Most of my content is simply reviewing old cartoons and what not, usually superhero related, however I also do a side series on the strange and creepy side of animation. For example, my 20K sub special was a three-part series on Disney and their alleged subliminal messages in film and television, and this video you&amp;rsquo;re watching now is sort of in that same vein. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be taking another look at a certain &amp;rsquo;lost episode.&amp;rsquo; For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, lost episodes are basically this urban legend about episodes of TV shows which were &amp;rsquo;lost&amp;rsquo;, as the name implies. These episodes are said to contain graphic and/or disturbing and surreal elements and are generally regarded as material that the public was not meant to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A few months ago I covered an alleged lost episode from the 1968 Filmation series &amp;lsquo;The Adventures of Batman&amp;rsquo;. I loved this show as a kid, even though it was a few decades before my time, and there was one episode with a scene where Batman and Robin fall through a trap door set by the Joker and slide toward their doom; at the end of the slide tunnel is a giant open furnace, looking like the Joker&amp;rsquo;s face. Of course, since this is a kid&amp;rsquo;s show, they don&amp;rsquo;t actually slide into the furnace and burn alive, they get out with their gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So to recap, in 2009 this anonymous internet post started circulating online about an alleged lost version of this scene. In it, the Dynamic Duo actually do slide into the furnace, burn alive, scream, and are shown graphically being burned to a crisp, followed by surreal and non-linear scenes of grieving friends of Bruce Wayne in mourning and the funeral service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now when I did my first video on this subject, I was honest with you guys: I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think there was much credibility to this story. I like to keep an open mind on this show, but there were just certain elements of the post that made me say, okay, this is probably bullshit, like how the tape conveniently erased itself after the anonymous author viewed it. But since then I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot of comments and emails talking about how allegedly this lost episode has been posted online. Naturally a lot of you are already saying this is fake, but this topic won the poll for this special, so let&amp;rsquo;s find out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/lost-episodes-can-be-found-again/part-2/Filmation_furnace.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/lost-episodes-can-be-found-again/part-2/Filmation_furnace.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Filmation furnace&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some more preamble, the video cut to the alleged lost episode, at the part where Batman and Robin are sliding down the tunnel toward the furnace. All the parts where the two use their belt gadgets to get free were removed, and when the two were close to the furnace, the screen filled with fire, and two poor-quality shrieks played. After that, there were some strange abstract scenes, but all of these seemed to be simply random clips from other episodes with some editing effects thrown at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartoon Geek returned. &amp;ldquo;Okay, so right off the bat, Batman and Robin die off-screen, which is obviously not what happened in the lost episode post that was shared around. They basically just used the flames from earlier in the scene and cut them over to make it look like Batman and Robin died, adding in a canned scream effect. The surreal scenes that follow are also just random clips from throughout the show with various editing tricks applied. I could have done some of them myself. So while this is impressive work, I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that this is a fan project inspired by the anonymous post. I&amp;rsquo;m going to rate this animation myth as debunked for now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave some more breakdown and deconstruction of the clip, before ending with some kind of promotional giveaway. What really got my attention however were some of the comments. There were at least a few people insisting that the lost episode was real and that they had seen it with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I PM&amp;rsquo;d one of these people. I asked if he had really seen the episode and about the circumstances. He responded within the hour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I was at summer school and during recess I snuck off to the school library&amp;rsquo;s backroom to be alone. I put a VHS of the cartoon that was there and saw it. Honestly I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really disturbed back then since my parents let me watch R-rated horror movies and stuff back then lol. But yeah man this thing is real.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if he knew any information about the other supposed &amp;ldquo;lost episode&amp;rdquo; phenomena, but he said he did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research of my own. There were a few lost episode stories floating around on the internet, mostly about children&amp;rsquo;s shows. To be honest, not many of them seemed all that credible. Still, I strongly felt there was something real here behind all the embellishment and fictionalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to see if there were any such stories surrounding &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt;. My searches for disturbing content in the movie returned nothing but the expected &amp;ldquo;hurr hurr this one scene in &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; totally scarred me for life as a kid&amp;rdquo; stuff or more information about that &lt;em&gt;Felidae&lt;/em&gt; movie. I tried reaching out to some of the credited animators, writers, and crew members, varying the content of my emails so as to cast as wide a net as possible. For example, some of my emails focused on disturbing content that may have been cut, while other drafts asked more generally about alternative versions or cut scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also expanded my web searches. I used all the search engine tricks I could find, and started using obscure and foreign-language engines. After a few months of no information and no responses to my email queries, I started to think that maybe I should just forget about the whole thing. Maybe my real memories of watching &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; had merged with some nightmare I had to create my present memories, and maybe repeating those memories to myself so many times during my childhood had falsely convinced me of their reality. I was about to consign to this newfound self-closure when I found something during one of my foreign-language searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a thread on a Chinese message board. The OP had a JPEG image and text that roughly translated to &amp;ldquo;Aristocats Movie. Creepy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had had coffee to drop and spill all over my computer, I would have. The image dashed away any hope I had of passing off my childhood experience as just a traumatic nightmare that had stuck in my head longer than it should have. It was a frame from whatever twisted version of &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; I had seen, and while I hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually remembered this particular still until I found this message board, the instant I saw it I remembered the clip and more memories started flooding back, still vague but vivid and definitely real. I was now more firmly convinced than I had ever been before that the violent version of the movie was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image was of the black kitten, Berlioz. His face nearly filled the frame, and his eyes were wide and terrified, red veins bulging, his fur standing up as if charged with electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t any more inherently disturbing than the grotesque fanart you can find for all kinds of different shows and movies, but unlike those other images I knew this one had a genuinely sinister story of some kind behind it. As such it haunted me like no other image ever had. There were only a couple replies on the thread, both of which were short and neither of which provided any more information about the image. I used Google Translate to try to ask the OP for more information, but never received a response. I performed a reverse-image search of the file, but it returned no other results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a few weeks later I finally got a reply to one of the emails I had sent to the production staff. The reply was to one of the emails I had written that hinted more strongly at the reality of what I had seen as a kid. The response was short and curt, but gave me new hope for finding answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello. Sorry for the late response, but I read between the lines of your message, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve seen what I think you were hinting at, you need to look into the Lost Media Group. That&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;m going to say on the subject.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled &amp;ldquo;lost media group&amp;rdquo;, but the closest thing I could find was a website for an online club called the Lost Media Society. It was a site for media enthusiasts to collect, trade, sell, buy, and discuss &amp;ldquo;lost media&amp;rdquo; including lost episodes as in, real lost episodes that simply never aired, not the urban legend ones that contained surreal, disturbing, or even supernatural content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This community was interesting in its own right, and I became involved with it, eventually even becoming a site moderator. Once I was established as a respected regular, I decided to PM one of the head admins and ask him about the lost episodes legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He responded that he had heard of it, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really something the site dealt with. He recalled that in the past it had been talked about and some had even suggested banning discussion about it since it was seen as a spam topic after a while. I asked if he knew about an organization called the Lost Media Group. He said he had heard of it, but didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about it, and suggested that I contact a certain other admin who did know more about this entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I messaged this admin, and got a response within the hour. He told me the Lost Media Group was the group alleged by some to be behind the &amp;ldquo;lost episodes&amp;rdquo; phenomenon. According to him they produced not just altered versions of movies and television episodes, but were also said to make their own versions of other media such as video games and comic books. He said he did not know much else about them other than that some lost media collectors were willing to pay large sums for an authentic work by this group, and that before the Lost Media Society had banned discussion of the lost episodes legend some of these collectors had asked about them on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if he could refer me to such a collector. He said my best bet would be a certain retired site admin who was no longer active in the Lost Media Society. He linked me a couple of archived threads by this individual asking about lost episodes, and gave me the man&amp;rsquo;s email address. I shot him an email asking about his interest in lost episodes, and even went as far as to directly ask if he knew about a &amp;ldquo;lost episode&amp;rdquo; type version of &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the edge of our town, there&amp;rsquo;s a shitty gas station that&amp;rsquo;s open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and sometimes longer. If you were to go inside, you would probably see the tired cashier sitting behind the front desk doing his best to mind his own business. He&amp;rsquo;s real. You may also see someone else. You may also see something else. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about the reality of anyone or anything else (including yourself) inside that small ammonia scented flickering-fluorescent collection of off-brand junk food, dirt, four walls, and a roof, may I recommend that you follow the cashier&amp;rsquo;s lead and mind your own business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at that gas station almost non-stop since I graduated high school. At this point, I doubt I could quit if I wanted to. But enough about me. Let&amp;rsquo;s get back to the interesting thing. The gas station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a decent amount of time yesterday at the start of my shift trying to decide which story would be worthy of being my first to document to the world. Any time I tell someone outside of the gas station anything about what happened therein, I know what to expect. People don&amp;rsquo;t believe it. Or people don&amp;rsquo;t want to believe it. Imagine the difficulty I had trying to call the sheriff station to explain that half of a pig broke into the store and is currently running amok, breaking things and screaming with the voice of an old woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I meant half of a pig.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, a pig.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The front half.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No this isn&amp;rsquo;t a joke. I&amp;rsquo;m at the gas station.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean, which gas station? The shitty one at the edge of town. You must be new; can I please talk to someone else?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She finally put me through to Tom. Tom is the sheriff&amp;rsquo;s deputy that drew the short straw all those years ago and had to come out to the gas station for the first time, back before his hair was all white. He&amp;rsquo;s been in enough times now that all I have to say when he picks up the line is &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s half a pig. It won&amp;rsquo;t stop screaming and I can&amp;rsquo;t catch it.&amp;rdquo; And then he grunts, mutters something about that being &amp;ldquo;pretty freakin&amp;rsquo; weird,&amp;rdquo; and then drives out to help me catch it. Tom is a good guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked around, but nobody knew where the pig had come from. This was back when Farmer Brown was still alive, and he came down to take a look and provide his expert opinion. According to Farmer, the pig had somehow been chopped down the middle, but miraculously none of the important organs were hit. Nothing supernatural about it, just really unusual. It stayed at the local elementary school as a kind of mascot for the summer before a scientist and his team from somewhere up north offered the school a thousand dollars to let them take it. For science, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to ramble, but my point is that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe some of these stories if you haven&amp;rsquo;t been inside the gas station at least once. And maybe you have. We&amp;rsquo;re the only gas station for miles. We&amp;rsquo;re close enough to some big crossroads. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been out driving in an unfamiliar part of the country and found yourself lost, it&amp;rsquo;s not impossible that you could have found yourself at my doors, maybe looking to top off your gas, maybe to ask for directions. If you have a strange memory of a weird place that somehow doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fit with the rest of your memories, then there&amp;rsquo;s a chance we&amp;rsquo;ve actually met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to last night. I was sitting behind the counter with a pen and book of receipt paper, trying to remember the strangest thing that has happened to me that still falls within the realm of believability, (I&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty of things happen that were strange but so unbelievable I won&amp;rsquo;t even waste anyone&amp;rsquo;s time ever telling them. I call those the &amp;ldquo;try-and-forget stories&amp;rdquo;) when Diego interrupted my concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego is one of the part-timers at the gas station. We have a long list of part-time employees. The owners like to hire transients, drifters, hitchhikers, passers-by and runaways looking for work for a few days. I try not to get to know the part-timers. They come and go after a few days, or sometimes a few weeks, rarely long enough to form any kind of meaningful relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then there&amp;rsquo;s Diego. Diego has been working here for almost a year now. He started as part of the prison work-relief program, unloading trucks twice a week. He was the only one of the twelve prisoners that didn&amp;rsquo;t disappear during a freak snow-storm last December, but that&amp;rsquo;s none of my business. Diego did his time, and when they released him he came to work here, cleaning the store and unloading trucks. He comes in six times a day for each of his thirty-minute shifts. Now that I think about it, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what he does during those shifts. The store is never clean and trucks only come twice a week, exclusively during the daylight hours as per an arrangement following the &amp;ldquo;incident.&amp;rdquo; Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll ask Diego what he does for the owners. All I know is that he&amp;rsquo;s the closest thing to a friend that I have here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Diego approached me at my register last night, I knew something unusual was going on. He was sweating bullets, pale, and on the verge of passing out. He kept glancing back at the man in the suit that had wandered into the store and was standing next to the frozen drink machine. He told me that he needed to talk. &amp;ldquo;Now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him, &amp;ldquo;Go ahead,&amp;rdquo; but he refused to say anything unless I followed him into the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually hate to leave the front of the store unwatched. We have the occasional shoplifter. Plus there was that one time Rocco got in and made off with two cases of cigarettes. But Diego seemed serious, so I made an exception for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we were in the subfreezing safety of the walk-in cooler, Diego asked me if I had seen the guy in the suit. I said yes, I saw him. He asked if I knew the guy. I said yes, I&amp;rsquo;d seen the guy around town. His name was Kieffer. He was running for some kind of office—I can&amp;rsquo;t remember which one—and stopped by the gas station every now and then. He drove an old black SUV that only took premium. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know him much from in town, but he was definitely local. His picture was framed in my high school&amp;rsquo;s trophy case for one of those sports competitions he had won years and years before I got there. We only have so many things to be proud of, I suppose. I knew of Kieffer, but we weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly acquaintances. I told all this to Diego, who shook his head and said, &amp;ldquo;No. That can&amp;rsquo;t be Kieffer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said, &amp;ldquo;Why not?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Diego told me, &amp;ldquo;That can&amp;rsquo;t be Kieffer, because Kieffer is dead. I killed him two days ago, and his body is in the trunk of my car right now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s when things started getting weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this. I recognize how awful it is to pause a story at a place like this, but I&amp;rsquo;m about to head back to work. I&amp;rsquo;m only just now taking my lunch break and I came all the way down here to the library to document last night before I forgot. I still have to eat and change out of these dirt-covered clothes before I head back (I did a lot of digging last night). Plus I don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave the part-timers alone with all those lawn gnomes until we know exactly what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention the lawn gnomes! I&amp;rsquo;m so scatter-brained right now. Like I said, it was a very strange night. Between the hand plants, Farmer Jr., and that cultist that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave me alone, I hardly had any time to collect my thoughts. And of course, there is the Diego situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll come back and tell you all about it, but first I need to grab some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you should have a good idea of what you can expect from Hell. You know to kill the first person you see when you fight your way out of a birthing sac. You know to find clothing, tools and shelter. You know that no matter what you do, how well you do, someday it&amp;rsquo;s back to being fresh meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dis is the biggest city you can imagine. Tribes fight and die for territory and taking a wrong turn is a fucking death sentence. You&amp;rsquo;ll get a feel for where you should and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go eventually, develop the kind of street smarts you need to stay a resident for more than a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, there are places in Dis that you should know about. Let&amp;rsquo;s do a little sightseeing tour of Hell, maybe the advance warning will do you some good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skin-street&#34;&gt;Skin Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to tell you about the first time I saw Skin Street. I dropped out of my birthing sac onto the road, stood straight back up and got myself ready to fight. Nobody was there. Not one single person was out on a street that stretched for miles in either direction. I relaxed a little and took a look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the streets in Dis are a labyrinthine network of buildings. You spend most of your stay in Hell paranoid that, just around the next corner, there&amp;rsquo;s someone ready to beat you down. Skin Street isn&amp;rsquo;t like that. It&amp;rsquo;s a single straight line with only the rain and the darkness to hamper visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt more vulnerable there than I&amp;rsquo;ve felt in any other part of Dis. You ever walked into a wide, empty space and suddenly felt exposed? Yeah, imagine also being naked, unarmed and in Hell. Still, I knew what I was supposed to do. The first step was to find some clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where I learned how Skin Street got its name. Every building, every busted street light and gas lamp was decorated with flayed skin. I&amp;rsquo;d been in Hell long enough by that point to not be too freaked out but I&amp;rsquo;d be lying if I said it didn&amp;rsquo;t affect me. In a fucked up kind of way, it reminded me of Christmas. Y&amp;rsquo;know? People hanging wreaths and lights from their houses, that sort of thing. I remembered the time I&amp;rsquo;d spent with my family &amp;hellip; with my kids on Christmas morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feelings like that get you killed. I pushed them back down and pulled some scraps from the nearest building. If somebody was going to leave clothing material lying about, I may as well take it, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it at the time but every step I took on Skin Street was being watched. When the attack came, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get a glimpse of the guy. Bang! My skull fractured from an expert swing of a club. Whoever hit me went for my eyes the second I hit the floor, stuck his fingers right into my sockets. I was blind and crying like a baby when he started to peel away my skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing, some people are fucked up even by Hell&amp;rsquo;s standards. The loners, serial killers, stalkers and psychos all make their way to Skin Street in the end. Most of the damned use the whole body of a kill but the Skin Street people like to take trophies. They leave their ornaments out as bait for the ignorant, skulking in the shadows and waiting for the best moment to ambush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself on Skin Street, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to think fast. Forget clothing, just grab a rock, piece of wood or anything else you can use as a weapon. Stay out of the shadows, keep checking behind you and get out of there as quickly as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;perdition-farms&#34;&gt;Perdition Farms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re going to be chased in Hell, that&amp;rsquo;s unavoidable. At some point, you&amp;rsquo;ll stumble into somebody bigger than you or you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself outnumbered. Forget about a fair fight, if somebody can take you down without you fighting back, you bet that&amp;rsquo;s what they&amp;rsquo;ll do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to lose focus when you&amp;rsquo;re running for your life. You can forget to pay attention to your surroundings. That, my friend, is a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outskirts of Perdition Farms are littered with billboards. They promise free food and safety to anybody fucking stupid enough to believe them. The tribes that fight over that particular territory like to herd people off the streets and into the industrial complex they call home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that those tribes won&amp;rsquo;t kill you. The bad news is that they&amp;rsquo;re big fans of taking people alive. They&amp;rsquo;ve got a project you see, been working on it for as long as I can remember. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you who originally decided that Hell should have organised food production, only that the idea stuck and that over the years, countless tribes have taken it upon themselves to try and make that dream a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get yourself captured by them and you can look forward to a bit of slave labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the Perdition Farms tribes try to make use of the birthing pods as a source of food. They force their slaves to harvest them from the walls, grind them up in industrial vats, mix them with blood, body parts, rainwater and anything else that could conceivably make a broth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of a slave is short, brutal and disgusting, particularly when those slaves are then used as guinea pigs for the latest concoction. You see, amniotic fluid can be drunk if you&amp;rsquo;re desperate, though drinking too much is guaranteed to make you empty your stomach from every available orifice. The flesh of the sacs is a different matter though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you exactly what the birthing sacs are. Some people say they&amp;rsquo;re actual flesh while others swear they&amp;rsquo;re more like a fungus. What I do know is that they repair themselves over time. Eat some of their flesh and over the next few days you&amp;rsquo;ll grow a new birthing sac inside you. It&amp;rsquo;s a small mercy that you won&amp;rsquo;t live long enough to see it break through your skin. You&amp;rsquo;ll be dead shortly after your stomach bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, your days as a slave will end when the tribe decides they want some real meat. They&amp;rsquo;re not stupid enough to test their broth themselves, not when there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of slaves in Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I can&amp;rsquo;t force you to stay out of Perdition Farms. I can only offer advice. In my opinion, if you think you&amp;rsquo;re being herded there, it&amp;rsquo;s better to take whatever&amp;rsquo;s to hand and cut your own throat. I&amp;rsquo;d take fresh meat status a hundred times before spending another day on the farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-boneyard&#34;&gt;The Boneyard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe you&amp;rsquo;re thinking to yourself, &amp;ldquo;Hey. I&amp;rsquo;m the kind of nutjob who&amp;rsquo;d join a cult. Is there anything in Hell for me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like you, the Boneyard has you covered. You see, there&amp;rsquo;s a certain kind of religious fanatic who really does belong in Hell. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the old dears who bake cakes to raise money for the new church roof here. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the guys who went to war because God commanded it, who burned women for supposedly consorting with demons and who saw nothing wrong with fucking the odd kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When those people get to Hell, they&amp;rsquo;re too thick-headed to make sense of what happened. Why face reality when you can pretend it&amp;rsquo;s all just a test of faith? They find likeminded folk in the Boneyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m told that at one time, the Boneyard was a cathedral surrounded by a cemetery that stretched from horizon to horizon. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s true, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. These days, it&amp;rsquo;s a shanty town of temples and churches built from materials scavenged from the streets. Everywhere you look, you&amp;rsquo;ll find wild-eyed zealots preaching their own twisted version of redemption and gangs of masked men on the prowl for fresh converts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortification of the flesh is the main pastime in the Boneyard. If you listen to the cacophony of sermons, you&amp;rsquo;ll be informed of how the flesh is wicked and must be purged of sin. How lucky we are to be given such a holy duty, how fortunate to be given the opportunity to redeem ourselves before God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of the Boneyard have had a long time and plenty of fucking practice when it comes to mastering torture and degradation. I&amp;rsquo;m not a good person. I&amp;rsquo;ve killed, raped and cannibalised but I can honestly tell you I&amp;rsquo;d never have been able to dream up some of the shit that goes on in the Boneyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wandered in there by accident once and I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to get what I saw out of my brain. I watched a woman, naked and bound, forced onto her knees and violated with iron rods. A preacher sewed his own eyes and lips shut in front of a crowd before sawing off his manhood with a piece of slate. A boy of maybe fourteen was publicly crucified, a girl was drowned in shit, an older man had sharpened flint pushed under his fingernails &amp;hellip; I could list off a hundred other atrocities done in the name of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay away from the Boneyard. The people there decided that Hell just isn&amp;rsquo;t hellish enough for their liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget about redemption. Forget about God. The only way out of Hell is by riding a pillar of fire and taking over a living body. Focus on that if you want to escape. The damned can&amp;rsquo;t offer you salvation. The damned only offer pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Chapter 2: Pathos</title>
		<link>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 01:47:34 -0600</pubDate>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathos was the same as Jupiter in layout, except the board was dark blue rather
than green. The first thing I noticed was that all the usual level icons had been
replaced by a blue rock and some kind of orange honeycomb shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one icon that had part of the Jungle Icon shape, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much
thought to it. I checked the other side of the board to see the new monster.
Instead of Hedorah, it was Biollante.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/pathos-board.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Pathos board&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been right. &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs Biollante&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t come out until
1989, and this game was made 1988. Perhaps Toho put Biollante in the game to build
excitement for the movie next year, but changed their minds? I tried to rationalize
the game&amp;rsquo;s abnormalities any way I could, but this would prove to be futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathos&amp;rsquo; map song was the first new song I heard in the game. Like most of the new
songs it was hard to describe, I&amp;rsquo;ll try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started out slow and suspenseful, much slower than any song in the game. But
every twelve seconds or so there would be a loud clashing sound, and the tempo
changed. It was like the composer randomly played parts from five different songs
with the same instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved Godzilla over to one of the many blue rock icons that had replaced the
jungle icons and started the level. The level resembled a blue mountain range
with a blood red planet in the sky. But there was something odd about the
mountains, they had a &amp;ldquo;shredded paper&amp;rdquo; look to them. I thought at first maybe the
glitch had affected it, but it looked far too intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/blue-mountains.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/blue-mountains.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Pathos&amp;rsquo;s blue mountains&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I quickly noticed something else about this new level: There were no enemies, at
all. Not even any obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that this was were the point meter started to become glitched
beyond comprehension. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me much, I never keep up with game
points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without having to focus on anything, I listened to the music while walking
through the level unopposed. The music had a sorrowful feel to it. It would have
been rather pleasant, had I heard it in a normal game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level went on for three screens, but with no obstacles around I finished it
very quickly. I tried other levels of the same type to see if any enemies appear,
but there were none. There was little else to be seen in the blue mountains,
so I tried the other level type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started one of the orange levels, and my eyes were assaulted with a grotesque
background of tumorous orange eyes. The &amp;ldquo;sky&amp;rdquo; was the same as the ground, so I
assumed the game was indicating that this level takes place in a cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/orange-tumours.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/orange-tumours.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Orange tumours&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only enemies here were Matango Spawn, but as you can see the little bastards
were everywhere. The music certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t help, with a mixture of screeching
sounds and loud drum beats that sounded like a monster&amp;rsquo;s theme in a horror film.
After completing it, I tried to avoid playing through anymore of these levels
whenever I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map was short so it was only a few minutes before I was headed towards a
rematch with Gezora and Moguera. But this time, their sprites and attack patterns
were vastly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fought Moguera first. Moguera&amp;rsquo;s replacement was a flying machine with a slight
resemblance to a Pascagoula alien. It was a bit like fighting Mothra, only it
moved with a lot more grace. It attacked by spinning its front tentacle like a
corkscrew, and it still had an eye beam, except now it fired from the drill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/moguera-3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lanky aberration had replaced Gezora, and the new beast was more of a
challenge. It would run and jump at a fast pace, constantly swinging its arms
around making it hard to get close, and of course it tried to pin me in the
corner with as much annoying resolve as ever. I defeated it using a combination
of tail whips and heat beam spamming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/gezora-3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I defeated them and was going to fight Titanosaurus, but when I started the fight
Titanosaurus was nowhere to be seen, and the game simply went back to the map with
the Titanosaurus piece now missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no one left to fight now but Biollante, so I eagerly started the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite surprised that Biollante started the fight in her Rose Form. She was
immobile and used tentacles to keep me away from the main body, which took the
most damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/biollante-1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/biollante-1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Biollante&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, she turned into her Final Form after taking enough damage. The sprite
looked pretty damn good for 8-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/biollante-2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle technique was the same, except now Biollante could move, albeit slower
than any other monster. Being hit by the tentacles did more damage now, and
Biollante could do an acid spit, which I managed to avoid by jumping in the
screencap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/biollante-3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much more difficult to beat than Titanosaurus, it only took two rounds. But
when Biollante was gone, The music had stopped, and there was a new icon
replacing the base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/red-board.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/red-board.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Mysterious icon&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This icon wasn&amp;rsquo;t there before I beat Biollante. It resembled a red tribal mask,
and I had a feeling of dread when I saw it. But it since it replaced the base,
it must be the only way to exit Pathos. I moved Godzilla to the square and
started the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/run.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/run.png&#34;  alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;Run&amp;rdquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a hellish looking place with no sky, and a flickering fire in the
background. The fire looked far more advanced than anything I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on the NES.
There was &amp;ldquo;music&amp;rdquo;, in the form of a slow, steady drum sound resembling a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the text on the top of the screen, and the life bar, were gone. In their place
was a single bit of text in the middle of the screen that said &amp;ldquo;RUN&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling of dread had intensified. I cautiously walked through the level, but
like the blue mountains there were no enemies. I paced around for a minute
before thinking &amp;ldquo;Run?&amp;hellip; from what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time it hit me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a noise outside my room and turned back to see if something fell, and
when I looked back Godzilla was dying. I figured it must have just been a glitch,
but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to play through the game without Godzilla so I restarted the
game and went to the password screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I ever mentioned how creepy the password screen music is? If you&amp;rsquo;ve played
the game, you know what I mean. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t at all fit the mood of the game,
it&amp;rsquo;s more like something from a horror game. Maybe they made it like that so
kids wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite annoyed at this point, because I thought I was going to have to fight
all the monsters again. But that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. The game started me off right where
I was before I started the red face level. So I tried again, making sure to pay
attention this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when heard a low bellowing sound, and then I saw it. This&amp;hellip; thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know that feeling your body has when you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re in extreme danger?
You start to recoil and tense up as the adrenaline flows through your veins,
and your nerves start to feel very cold?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the feeling I had when I took this screencap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/run-2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen all the Godzilla movies, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty damn sure THIS was never
in any of them. It had to be something the creators made up. But what kind of
sick fuck would put THIS in a children&amp;rsquo;s game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-2-pathos/run-3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By sheer dumb luck, or perhaps the adrenaline boost, I managed to run fast enough
to get away from it. It ran very fast, so much so that if you saw it you were
almost certainly going to die. And when I say &amp;ldquo;die&amp;rdquo;, I mean your monster gets
killed instantly if the creature touches them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had gone back to the map, I was so afraid that I was extremely tempted to
just shut the game off and try to pretend this never happened. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe
what I had just seen, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if I wanted to continue, I still had to get Mothra through this chase
level. But as I stayed inactive on the map screen for a few minutes, my fear
was replaced by burning curiosity. What the hell had just happened? What was
the rest of the game like? I only had to beat this level with Mothra and then
it was onto the next world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I moved Mothra to the red face, the game registered it as me beating
the level. I was quite relieved. I tried to prepare myself for the next world:
&amp;ldquo;Trance&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

		<title>Part Two</title>
		<link>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/im-a-search-and-rescue-officer/part-2/</link>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I logged back on tonight and was blown away by the staggering amount of interest this seems to have generated. First off, I&amp;rsquo;ll address a few things that you guys have brought up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been an overwhelming amount of people mentioning the similarity between some of my stories and those of David Paulides. I assure you I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to rip him off in any way; I&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing but respect for the guy. He&amp;rsquo;s actually what inspired me to write this, because I can verify a lot of the things he talks about. We do have a lot of these strange missing persons cases, and most of the time, they aren&amp;rsquo;t solved. Either that, or we find them in places they have no business being. I personally haven&amp;rsquo;t been on many calls like that, but I&amp;rsquo;ll share a few that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, and a story my friend told me that relates to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of feedback about the stairs, so I&amp;rsquo;ll touch on that briefly here, and I&amp;rsquo;ll also include a story. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and conditions. Some are pretty dilapidated, just ruins, but others are brand new. I saw one set that looked like they came from a lighthouse; they were metal and spiral, almost old-fashioned. The stairs don&amp;rsquo;t go up infinitely or farther than I can see, but some sets are taller than others. Like I said before, just imagine the stairs in your house, as if someone copy-pasted them in the middle of nowhere. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any pictures. It&amp;rsquo;s never really occurred to me to try again after the first time, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like risking my job over it. I&amp;rsquo;ll try again in the future, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really promise anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people expressed confusion about the guy who ran into the man with no face. Just to clarify, when the climber ascended and reached the top of the peak, he saw another man in a parka and ski pants. This was the man with no face. Sorry about the confusing wording of that story, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to avoid that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, on to the new stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as missing persons go, I&amp;rsquo;d say about half the calls I get are related to that. The others are rescue calls: people who fall down cliffs and hurt themselves, get injured by fire (you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe how often this happens, mostly drunk kids), get bitten or stung by animals or insects, etc. We&amp;rsquo;re a tight team, and we have veterans who are excellent at finding signs of lost people. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes these cases where we never find any trace of them so frustrating. One in particular was upsetting for all of us, because we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; find a trace of them, but it just led to more questions than answers. An older man had been hiking alone on a well-established trail, but his wife called to say that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t come home when he should have. Apparently, he had a history of seizures, and she was worried that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken his medication and had suffered one out on the trail. Before you ask, I have no idea why he thought it was okay to go out alone, or why she didn&amp;rsquo;t go with him. I don&amp;rsquo;t ask about that kind of thing because past a certain point, it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Someone is missing, and it&amp;rsquo;s my job to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out in a standard search formation, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before one of our vets found signs that the guy had gone off the trail. We grouped up and followed him, spreading out in a fan to make sure we were covering as much ground as possible. Suddenly, a call comes over the radio telling us to all head back to the vets location, and we come right away, because this usually means the missing person is injured and we need a full team to help get them out safely. We meet back up, and the vet is just standing at the base of a tree with his hands on the sides of his head. I ask my buddy what&amp;rsquo;s going on, and he points up into the branches of this tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe what I was seeing, but there&amp;rsquo;s a walking stick dangling from a branch at least thirty feet off the ground. The little strap thing on the handle has been looped around the branch, and it&amp;rsquo;s just hanging there. There&amp;rsquo;s no way the guy could have tossed it up that far, and we don&amp;rsquo;t see any other signs that he&amp;rsquo;s still in the area. We call up into the tree, but it&amp;rsquo;s obvious no one&amp;rsquo;s in it. We&amp;rsquo;re all just sort of left scratching our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep searching for the guy, but we never find him. We even bring our canines out, but they lose his scent long before this tree. Eventually, the search is called off, because there are other calls we have to attend to, and past a certain point, there&amp;rsquo;s not much we can do. The guy&amp;rsquo;s wife called us every day for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; afterwards, asking if we&amp;rsquo;d found her husband, and it was heartbreaking to hear her get more and more hopeless each time. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why this call in particular was so upsetting, but I think it was just the sheer improbability of it. That and the questions that were raised. How the hell had this guy&amp;rsquo;s cane ended up there? Did someone kill him and toss that up there as some weird trophy? We did our best to find him, but it was almost like a taunt. We still talk about that one from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing kids are the most heart-breaking. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what circumstances they go missing under; it&amp;rsquo;s never easy, and we always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; dread the ones we find deceased. It&amp;rsquo;s not common, but it does happen. David Paulides talks a lot about kids SAR teams find in places they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be, or couldn&amp;rsquo;t be. I can honestly say I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about this kind of thing happening more than I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it, but I&amp;rsquo;ll share one of the ones that I think about a lot that I witnessed personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mother and her three kids were out for a picnic in an area of the park that has a small lake. One is six, one is five, and the other is about three. She&amp;rsquo;s watching them all really closely, and according to her, she never lets them out of her sight at any time. She never saw anyone else in the area, either, which is important. She packs their stuff up and they start to head back to the parking area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this lake is only about two miles into the woods, and it&amp;rsquo;s on a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clearly established trail. It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to get lost getting from the parking area to it, unless you&amp;rsquo;re deliberately going off the path like an imbecile. Her kids are walking in front of her, when she hears what sounds like someone coming up the path behind her. She turns around, and in the four or so seconds she&amp;rsquo;s not looking, her five-year-old son vanishes. She figures he&amp;rsquo;s stepped off the trail to pee or something, and she asks her other two kids where he went. They both tell her that &amp;lsquo;a big man with a scary face&amp;rsquo; came out of the woods next to them, took the kid&amp;rsquo;s hand, and led him into the trees. The two remaining kids don&amp;rsquo;t seem upset; in fact, she says later that it seems like they&amp;rsquo;ve been drugged. They&amp;rsquo;re sort of spacey and fuzzy. So of course, she freaks out and starts looking frantically in the area for her kid. She&amp;rsquo;s screaming his name, and she says at one point, she thinks she heard him answer her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now obviously, she can&amp;rsquo;t go blindly running into the woods; she&amp;rsquo;s got the other two kids. She calls the police, and they send us out immediately. We respond, and we start the search for him. Over the course of this search, which spans &lt;em&gt;miles&lt;/em&gt;, we never find a single trace of the kid. Canines can&amp;rsquo;t pick up any scent and we don&amp;rsquo;t find any clothing or broken bushes or literally anything that would signify a child being there. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s suspicion about the mother for a while, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that she&amp;rsquo;s completely destroyed by the whole thing. We looked for this kid for weeks, with a lot of volunteer help. But eventually, the search peters out, and we have to move on. The volunteers keep searching, though, and one day, we get a call on the radio letting us know that a body has been found and needs to be recovered. They tell us the location, and none of us can believe it. We figure it has to be a different kid. But we go out there, about 15 miles from the site where he vanished, and sure enough, we find the body of the kid we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to figure out how this kid got where he did ever since we found him, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never come up with an answer. A volunteer just happened to be in the area, because he figured he might as well look in places no one else would think to, on the off chance the body had been dumped. He comes to the base of a tall, rocky slope, and halfway up, he sees something. He looks through his binoculars, and sure enough, it&amp;rsquo;s the body of a little boy, stuffed in a little opening in the rock. He recognizes the color of the kid&amp;rsquo;s shirt, so he knows right away that it&amp;rsquo;s the missing boy. That&amp;rsquo;s when he calls it in, and we&amp;rsquo;re dispatched. It took us almost an hour to get his body down, and none of us could believe what we were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was this kid 15 miles from where he&amp;rsquo;d started, but there was no possible way he could have gotten up there on his own. This slope is treacherous, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard even for us with our climbing gear. A five-year-old boy had no way of getting up there, of that I&amp;rsquo;m certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but the kid doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a scratch on him. His shoes are gone, but his feet aren&amp;rsquo;t damaged or dirty. So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as if an animal dragged him up there. And from what we can tell, he hasn&amp;rsquo;t been dead that long. He&amp;rsquo;d been out there over a month by that point, and it looked like he&amp;rsquo;d only been dead for, at most, a day or two. The whole thing was unbelievably strange, and was one of the most disconcerting calls I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been on. We found out later that the coroner determined the kid had died from exposure. He&amp;rsquo;d frozen to death, probably late at night two days before we found him. There were no suspects and no answers. To date, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the weirdest things I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first jobs as a trainee was a search op for a four-year-old kid that had gotten separated from his mom. This was one of those cases where we knew we were gonna find him because the dogs were on a strong scent trail, and we saw clear signs that he was in the area. We ended up finding him in a berry patch about half a mile from where he&amp;rsquo;d been last seen. Kid wasn&amp;rsquo;t even aware that he&amp;rsquo;d wandered that far. One of the vets brought him back, which I was glad for because I&amp;rsquo;m really not good with kids; I find it hard to talk to them and keep them company. As my trainer and I are headed back, she decides to take me on a detour to show me one of the hot spots where we tend to find missing people. It&amp;rsquo;s a natural dip in the land near a popular trail, and people will usually move downhill because it&amp;rsquo;s easier. We hike out there, it&amp;rsquo;s a few miles away, and we get there in about an hour or so. As we&amp;rsquo;re walking around the area and she&amp;rsquo;s pointing out places she&amp;rsquo;s found people in the past, I see something in the distance. Now, this area we&amp;rsquo;re in is about eight miles from the main parking area, though there&amp;rsquo;s back roads you can take to get closer if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hike that far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;rsquo;re on state-protected land, which means there can&amp;rsquo;t be any kind of commercial or residential development out here. The most you&amp;rsquo;ll ever see is a fire tower or makeshift shelter that homeless people think they can get away with building. But I can see from here that whatever this thing is has straight edges, and if there&amp;rsquo;s one thing you learn quickly, it&amp;rsquo;s that nature rarely makes straight lines. I point it out, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything. She just hangs back and lets me wander over and check it out. I get within about twenty feet of it, and all the hair on the back of my neck stands up. It&amp;rsquo;s a staircase - in the middle of the fucking woods. In the proper context, it would literally be the most benign thing ever. It&amp;rsquo;s just a normal staircase, with beige carpet, and about ten steps tall. But instead of being in a house, where it obviously should be, it&amp;rsquo;s out here in the middle of the woods. The sides aren&amp;rsquo;t carpeted, obviously, and I can see the wood it&amp;rsquo;s made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost like a video game glitch, where the house has failed to load completely and the stairs are the only thing visible. I stand there, and it&amp;rsquo;s like my brain is working overtime to try and make sense of what I&amp;rsquo;m seeing. My trainer comes and stands next to me, and she just stands there casually, looking at it as if it&amp;rsquo;s the least interesting thing in the world. I ask her what the fuck this thing is doing here, and she just chuckles. &amp;lsquo;Get used to it, rookie. You&amp;rsquo;re gonna see a lot of them.&amp;rsquo; I start to move closer, but she grabs my arm. Hard. &amp;lsquo;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do that,&amp;rsquo; she said. Her voice is casual, but her grip is tight, and I just stand there looking at her. &amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo;re gonna see them all the time, but don&amp;rsquo;t go near them. Don&amp;rsquo;t touch them, don&amp;rsquo;t go up them. Just ignore them.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start to ask her about it, but something in the way she&amp;rsquo;s looking at me tells me that it&amp;rsquo;s best if I don&amp;rsquo;t. We end up moving on, and the subject doesn&amp;rsquo;t come up again for the rest of my training. She was right, though. I&amp;rsquo;d say about every fifth call I go on, I end up running across a set of stairs. Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re relatively close to the path, maybe within two or three miles. Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re twenty, thirty miles out, literally in the middle of nowhere, and I only find them during the broadest searches or training weekends. They&amp;rsquo;re usually in good condition, but sometimes it looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve been out there for miles. All different kinds, all different sizes. The biggest I ever saw looked like they came out of a turn-of-the-century mansion, and were at least ten feet wide, with steps leading up at least fifteen or twenty feet. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried talking about it with people, but they just give me the same response my trainer did. &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s normal. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it, they&amp;rsquo;re not a big deal, but don&amp;rsquo;t go close to them or up them.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trainees ask me about it now, I give them the same response. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what else to tell them. I&amp;rsquo;m really hoping someday I get a better answer, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another one that was less spooky and more sad. A young man went missing late in winter, when realistically, no one should be going that far out onto the trails. We close a lot of them, but some remain open year round, unless there&amp;rsquo;s a shit-load of snow. We did an op for him, but we had about six feet of snow on the ground (it was an unusually heavy snow year), and we knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t likely that we&amp;rsquo;d find him until spring when the thaw came. Sure enough, when the first big thaw came, a hiker reported a body a little ways off the main trail. We found him at the base of a tree, in a pile of melted snow. I knew right away what had happened, and it scared the living shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you who ski or snowboard or spend any amount of time on a mountain will probably have guessed, too. When snow falls, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t collect as thick in the areas beneath the branches. It happens most with fir trees, because they have a sort of closed umbrella shape. So what you end up with is a space around the base of a tree that&amp;rsquo;s filled with a mixture of loose, powdery snow, air, and branches. They&amp;rsquo;re called tree wells, and they&amp;rsquo;re not immediately obvious if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. We put up signs in the welcome center, big ones, letting people know how dangerous they are, but every year that we get an unusual amount of snow, at least one person doesn&amp;rsquo;t read them, or doesn&amp;rsquo;t take the warning seriously, and we find out about it in spring. My best guess is that this young man was hiking and got tired, or maybe a cramp from walking in the deep snow. He went to go sit at the base of the tree, not knowing that there was a tree well, and fell in. He got stuck with his feet up, and the surrounding snow caved in around him. Unable to free himself, he suffocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s called snow immersion suffocation, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually happen except in really deep snow. But if you get stuck in a weird position, like this guy did, even six feet of snow can be lethal. What scared me the most was imagining how he must have struggled. Upside down, in the freezing cold, he didn&amp;rsquo;t die quickly. The snow would have formed a dense, heavy pile on top of him, and it would have been literally impossible to get out. As it got harder to breathe, he would have known what was happening. I can&amp;rsquo;t even imagine what he was thinking in his last moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my less outdoorsy friends want to know if I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen the Goatman while I&amp;rsquo;ve been out on calls. Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had anything quite like that happen. I guess the closest was the whole &amp;lsquo;black-eyed man&amp;rsquo; thing, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything. However, there was one call where I had something kind of similar happen, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m willing to chalk it up to the Goatman. We&amp;rsquo;d gotten a report that an older woman had fainted along one of the trails and needed assistance getting back down to the main area. We hike up to where she&amp;rsquo;s at, and her husband is just beside himself. He runs, well, I guess more jogs, to us, and tells us that he was a little ways off the trail looking at something when his wife starts screaming behind him. He runs back to her and she&amp;rsquo;s passed out on the trail. We get her on a backboard, and as we&amp;rsquo;re getting her down to the welcome center, she comes to and starts screaming again. I calm her down and ask her what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t remember verbatim what she said, but essentially, what happened was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;d been waiting for her husband when she started hearing this really strange sound. She said it sounded sort of like a cat, but it was off somehow, and she couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite figure out why. She went a little ahead to try and hear it better, and it sounded like it was coming closer. She said the closer it got, the more uneasy she was, until she finally figured out what was wrong. I do remember this next part, because it was so weird that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could forget it if I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a cat. It was a man, saying the word &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo; over and over. Just &amp;lsquo;meow, meow, meow&amp;rsquo;. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a man, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been, because I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard a man make his voice buzz like that. I thought my hearing aid was going out, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t, I adjusted it and it still sounded all buzzy. It was awful. He was coming closer, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see him. And the closer he got the more scared I was, and the last thing I remember was a shape coming out of the trees. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s when I fainted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I&amp;rsquo;m a little perplexed as to why a guy would be out in the fucking woods chanting &amp;lsquo;meow, meow&amp;rsquo; at people. So once we get down the mountain, I tell my superior that I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go search the area to see if I can find anything. He gives me the go ahead, and I grab a radio and hike back to where she fainted. I don&amp;rsquo;t see anyone, so I keep going about a mile more, and when I head back, I go off the trail, to see if I can figure out where she saw him coming from. It&amp;rsquo;s almost sunset by this point, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any desire to be out at night alone, so I just sort of write it off and make a mental note to check it out again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I&amp;rsquo;m headed back, I start to hear something in the distance. I stop, and I call out for anyone in the immediate area to identify themselves. The sound didn&amp;rsquo;t come closer or get louder, but it sounded exactly like a man saying &amp;lsquo;meow, meow&amp;rsquo; in this really odd monotone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As comical as it makes it sound, it was almost like that guy on South Park with the electrolarynx, Ned. I go off the trail in the direction I think it&amp;rsquo;s coming from, but I never seem to get closer. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like it&amp;rsquo;s coming from all directions. Eventually, it just sort of fades out, and I ended up going back to the welcome center. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any further reports like that, and even though I went back to that area, I never heard that exact sound again. I suppose it could have been some stupid kid out there fucking with people, but even I have to admit it was weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this kind of turned into a massive wall of text, and for that, I apologize. I wanted to get to the stories my friend told me, and he does have some good ones, so I&amp;rsquo;ll post those tomorrow evening. I also have a few more of my own I think you guys will like. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to keep you all in suspense again, hopefully the stories here make up for it and help you get through the next 24 hours until I can post again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: Since it seems like all of you would like to hear more, tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll write up as many stories as I can and do a massive post. I&amp;rsquo;ll include my friend&amp;rsquo;s stories, and I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can&amp;rsquo;t get ahold of a few more people who might have interesting things to talk about. I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how people felt about big huge walls of text, but if you&amp;rsquo;re all okay with it, I&amp;rsquo;ll post lots of stories!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/the-church-in-the-woods/part-2/Congregation.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Congregation room&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was particularly excited about this onsite job. Later on that evening, my boss called again, and filled me in on more details about the request. He told me that traveling to the church would be quite a drive and that its location was in the countryside secluded from most towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave me strict instruction to abide by their basic rules and to not offend them by any means. Apparently, they had paid handsomely for this service and he wanted to be sure our company kept every dime. He did note that I only had to respect their rules and not necessarily buy into any of their religious activities or anything. He told me to stop by the office in the morning for the necessary equipment. He promised that the company would reimburse me with the cost of travel and reminded me to call daily with any updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t a big fan of religion, but I wasn’t going to complain if they were providing food and a room for sleeping. Again, it was a chance to get out of the office for a few days. That night, I quickly packed up enough items for two weeks into two big suitcases. After preloading my car, I set my alarm early, knowing that I would need to compensate for the drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was strange. My night was dreamless and it was quick. It felt as if I had closed my eyes for a second before I heard my alarm go off for the next day. What struck me even odder was the fact that I could not recall what had stirred me up the night before. I had a disturbing dream when visiting my parents, that much I knew, but of what specifically, evaded my memory. I dismissed the thought believing it to be for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being tired from the early rise, I was up without a struggle and ready to embark. The outside air was cooler than I usually preferred; the sky was starless almost like a dark veil was across it. I hopped in my car and kept the windows up this time with the heat at full blast. There were a few times where my eyes rolled back from the tiredness, but the radio helped keep that temptation at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the quick stop by the office to gather up all the necessary equipment needed for the job. My boss already had it packed and ready to be loaded upon my arrival. He wasn’t there himself, but with the help from the third-shift crew, I was able to load everything into my trunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, they provided me a set of GPS directions provided by my boss. Once I thanked the crew for helping, I made my way on the road. The further I drove, the more scarce the streetlights and other cars became. Before long, the sun had fully emerged giving sight to the endless oceans of green pastures and cornfields. Eventually though, even the pastures came to an end and soon I found myself swallowed by the dense patches of trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My car barely managed to remain on the thin rough path; below I could hear the rocks and twigs crunching under the wheels. I held my breath a few times, slowing my vehicle down hoping to not incur a flat tire, which was the last thing I needed. After what felt like ages, I finally came across a fairly large building ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building itself was an old structure, standing tall and stretched far back into the woods. Its appearance was withered, made of old wood, pale and decayed. It swayed a few times at the course of the wind letting off a most-disturbing groan as if suffering, wishing to be put out of its misery. Truly it was amazing that such a building hadn’t already collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing to approach, I could make out more of its structure. The building appeared to be two stories. Its front was rather plain aside from the monotonous row of windows – a row of three that ran across the second floor. The windows themselves were elongated, running along the sides of the building as well. I was thrown off by the sight of this structure. I was sure my boss had informed me this was to be a church. I wasn’t much of a church-goer, but the building before me looked more like an old warehouse or boarding home rather than a place of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rugged path led up its entrance. In the front of a set of double-doors, I could see a lone figure standing, waiting for my approach. It was an elderly man in his mid-fifties in a grey suit and black tie. He immediately made his way to me when I parked. His walk was hobbled but elegant in poise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little hesitant, I gradually let down my window, greeted by his big toothy smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Afternoon, son,&amp;quot; he said in a strong country accent. &amp;ldquo;Yer the technician we’ve been waitin&amp;rsquo; for?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taken back by his overpowering cologne; it smelled like a poor concoction of baby powder and sunflower seeds. He was balding towards the top of his head while his snowy white hair grew around the edge like a crescent. Deep wrinkles were pressed across his face and seemed to grow in number with his smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly stuttering, I answered, “Y-yes, sir. Pleased to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave off an old man’s chuckle, still housing his toothy grin. “There’s no need to be shy, son. I’m Reverend Gary Gooding. You can call me Gary. Welcome to Peach Herb County,” he said extending out a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nervously, I shook it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;d like to personally thank ya&amp;rsquo; for coming all the way out here. I know it must’ve been something for ya&amp;rsquo;. I hope ya&amp;rsquo; didn’t get too lost on the way over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I couldn’t find my voice and only shook my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s good. Look here, why don’t ya&amp;rsquo; swing your car right around to the side. I’ll get one of my people to help ya&amp;rsquo; get yer stuff settled in. Ya&amp;rsquo; don’t have to lift a finger, understand?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gestured to the right-hand side of the building. I nodded and drove around as instructed and parked. Before I could even vacate the car, I jumped when stared ahead. There a man standing in front. I hadn’t even see him approach; I couldn’t lie. He was much younger than the Reverend, but clearly older than me. He had slick black hair combed-over to the side and wore a dark vest resting over a white button-top with grey dress pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave a slight wave while approaching my car. I exited and was greeted with a firm handshake. “Terrance Crowe,” he said. His accent wasn’t as strong as the Reverend’s. “Welcome to Peach Herb.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could tell that his smile was forced; even his eyes looked annoyed, but I thanked him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ya&amp;rsquo; have any luggage on you?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” I said. “It’s in the back.” I unlocked the door. Before I could turn around, the man quickly swooped over to the passenger door, opened it, and pulled out both suitcases. He began making his way towards the front gesturing me with his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ya’ll have to forgive my impatience. I was in the middle of something important before the Reverend had me pulled to assist ya&amp;rsquo;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s alright,” I assured him. “I know the feeling. You’d be surprised how often my boss does that to me. I sometimes wonder if he actually &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; me to get the job done,” I joked, hoping to lighten the mood. He didn’t laugh. I could hear his grunts as he struggled to carry the weight of my suitcases, occasionally swaying to the side. I felt guilty for letting him do so, but didn’t want to impede on their hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He led me around to the front and through the double-doors. I half-expected to find the Reverend waiting for us with his grin, but he was nowhere to be seen. Inside, we came into what looked like a lobby area. It was much nicer than I expected, completely different from the outside appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside, the air was cold, borderline comfortable. Perhaps it was the hint of honey and sunflowers in the midst that made it bearable. The lobby was a simple room. Everything around held a calm pearl white. It was filled with a few tables and chairs up up against the wall. A golden chandelier hung from the ceiling, giving the bland room a more elegant feel. A red carpet led from the entrance to a set of closed double-doors ahead. Two other doors sat on the left and right walls, both closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man led me inside, setting down the suitcases. He took out a handkerchief from his vest pocket to wipe away the sweat from his brow. “This here is the Lobby,” he finally said, tucking the handkerchief back in his pocket. I chuckled to myself as if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious. “Through the left door,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;ya&amp;rsquo;ll find a hallway leadin&amp;rsquo; to the dinin&amp;rsquo; area. To the right is a staircase leadin&amp;rsquo; to the livin&amp;rsquo; Quarters. Ya’ll be stayin&amp;rsquo; in room six. If ya&amp;rsquo; give me a minute, I&amp;rsquo;ll fetch yer keys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What about those?” I asked, gesturing to the main double-doors ahead. “Where do those lead to?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He glanced towards the doors as if now realizing their presence. “Those lead to the Congregation room where we conduct our services. Ya’ll find we conduct those on a daily basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Daily? That’s a bit much,” I said jokingly. “Whatever happened to once a week?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again he didn&amp;rsquo;t laugh, his face stern and solid. “Mister…?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pale… Marcus Pale. Sorry, I never did introduce myself,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right. Mr. Pale, this is a &lt;em&gt;church&lt;/em&gt;. I’m sure where ya&amp;rsquo; come from, once a week will suffice, but &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, it is our life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused, peering into my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ya&amp;rsquo; do attend a church, right?” My eyes must have truly given it away. He smiled, shaking his head. “Yer not much of a religious man now are ya&amp;rsquo;, Mr. Pale?” The tone of his voice matched his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged slightly, taken off-beat at this question. “No, I guess not,” I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I see. Please forgive me when I say this then, but maybe ya&amp;rsquo; should just keep yer mind on yer job then. That is the reason why yer here. Understand?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, sure,” I replied, dryly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good. I’ll be back with yer keys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just stood there. The nervous feeling I had earlier had subsided; now what I felt was awkwardness. What was the guy’s problem? There was no need for his rudeness. The pity I felt for him earlier was no longer present. Yet, I shook it off remembering that my boss said not to offend these people by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes went by and I still found myself standing there. What was taking so long? He made it sound like the keys were right behind the door. My eyes began wandering, bouncing from one side of the room to the next until finally settling on the double-doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had a symbol, an emblem of some kind imprinted down the middle of them. Curious, I walked over to them to get a better look. The emblem on the white doors was golden, almost looking imperial-like. It resembled a face&amp;hellip; no, maybe it was flower? It was surrounded with what appeared to be a wavering cloak of some kind. Did it have to do with their religion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still curious, I glanced over to the door where the man had disappeared behind. Finally, I returned my eyes back on the double-doors. They had fairly large bar-handles acting as the knobs. I was hesitant, but I slowly reached out to one of them. When my hand made contact with it, I felt a hint of warmness. This was peculiar because the room was cold, so how was this likely? The handle felt as if some had held it just recently, perhaps minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jerked back on it, but the door didn’t budge. I tried a few more times, but was unsuccessful; it was locked. I looked around it to see if there was keyhole, maybe I could peek inside. Instead, I found a small indent next to the handle. The indent was no bigger than a quarter maybe. Could this be the lock? I looked closer to see it had a similar design as the emblem engraved on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling defeated, I made my way over to one of the chairs and sat. Hopefully the man wouldn’t be any longer. It was probably for the best that it didn’t open though. My first day on the job and I was already snooping around. I was actually glad the man didn’t catch me attempting to break in like that. That stunt could have had my ass sent home, especially since he already seemed to be an uptight jerk. If that had happened, my boss would’ve had a field day on me for blowing such a high paying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man eventually returned from the back with a large ring of keys in his hand. He hastily ushered me to follow, grabbing my luggage, and proceeded to the door on the right. Just as he had mentioned, there was a staircase on the other side. This area appeared more on par with the outside appearance of the building looking pale and decayed. Every step we took was followed by a long-winded creak. I was sure that at any moment they would give out on either of us, but they never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the top and came to a long dimly lit hallway with another red carpet except this was long enough to run to the end. The doors in the hallway appeared adjacent and parallel to each other. Electric candles illuminated the area from the walls in-between the doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man led me halfway down before halting at the door on the right. “This is yer room,” he stated, unlocking the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door produced a loud creak as he opened. I braced myself, expecting to find a poorly conditioned room but was met an agreeable sight instead. It was similar appearance to the lobby: plain with pearly white walls. A large king-size bed sat neatly near the window; blanket and sheets and even a pillow were already provided. In the corner sat a sturdy wooden desk with a brass lamp on its stead. A tall bookshelf was leaned against the wall empty of books with a small dresser to its side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room looked very comfortable. The thought of staying in it for a few days was very appealing. The man placed my luggage near the dresser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ya&amp;rsquo; can put yer clothes up in here. Breakfast is at eight, lunch at twelve and dinner at six&amp;hellip;sharp,” he stated handing me a key from the ring. “Yer welcome to wear whatever pleases ya&amp;rsquo; to the meals, just make sure yer &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; late. We don’t start eating until everyone is present.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eight, twelve and six,” I repeated. “Got it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By the way, Mr. Pale? I’m interested to know how you propose to conduct yer work without any of yer&amp;hellip;supplies?” he asked before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chuckled to myself. “Oh yeah, sorry. I forgot to mention all my equipment is in the trunk of my car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave an unsettling glare and held out his hand. “Yer car keys, please.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned him an unassured look, but quickly handed them over when I saw his glare tighten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will return yer keys once I have acquired everything that ya’ll need from yer car. The Reverend informed me that ya&amp;rsquo; will not have to conduct any work until tomorrow so please enjoy the rest of yer evening. I will move yer supplies into the office downstairs. Ya&amp;rsquo; can find the office after heading through the door on left; it’s on the way to the dining area. We’ll see ya&amp;rsquo; at dinner,” he said, shutting the door behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I was left alone once again. The quietness of my room left me with a dull numbing sense. For a second, I was lost in its trance until the moan of the building from the wind awakened me. Once out of it, I turned my attention back to my room. Clearly it must’ve been recently refurbished. I ran my fingers along the surface of the desk. Just from sight alone, I could tell its history dated back with the building. Even so, it felt like it truly belonged despite its age. I made my way over to the window, looking below. I could see my car, but no sight of the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged it off. He could take as long as he wanted as long as he didn’t break anything, I thought. I smirked at this and returned my attention back inside. My eyes fell on the bookshelf. Although it was empty, several imprints from books could be seen in between the dust. The size of the imprints indicated they must have been fairly large books. Near the edge of the shelf, I could see dragging marks as if someone had removed all the books, maybe in anger or perhaps in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was probably done on purpose. I couldn’t blame them. These people here seemed like the secretive-type. They probably didn’t want me looking through any of their texts. My eyes floated over to the bed; it looked very tempting. I wanted to just crash on it, but I knew I had to call my boss first. I promised him that I would inform him of any updates. Even though I hadn’t started yet, I could at least inform him that had I arrived on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my phone and checked the signal bar strength: it was hovering between one bar and none. This wasn’t a surprise considering where I was. I played around with its positioning, first raising it higher and then side-to-side. I had no luck though. I even tried holding it closer to the window, but still was unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was possible that it was just the room blocking the signal. So, I made my way out into the hallway keeping my phone stretched out. With my eyes fixated on it, I moved around the hallway aimlessly still changing its position. Eventually, I realized how pointless it was. I decided to see if I had better luck outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went downstairs and into the lobby checking my phone along the way. Feeling the frustration build up, I aimlessly swung it around threatening to just toss the useless junk. Without warning, I was thrown off by a loud scream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following it came a voice that yelled out: “Hey, watch it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned, almost jumping out of my skin. The voice belonged to a young woman&amp;hellip; a quite attractive one to say the least. Her green eyes flared at me in anger. She had auburn hair that curled around her face and over her eyes. She wore what appeared to be a black and green Victorian-styled dress. The most eye-catching part about her was that she was pregnant. She had to be at least eight months by how much her stomach extended through her gown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I-I’m sorry. I didn’t m-mean to,” I stammered quickly. “I was trying to find a signal and I was getting&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her glare softened and a smile formed. She eventually let out a light giggle at my attempt to explain myself. “Okay, okay. It&amp;rsquo;s fine, you’re forgiven already,” she said. Her voice? She had a British accent. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why considering everyone seemed to have a country one. “You must be the technician I’ve been hearing about?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh yeah,” I said blushing. “You’ve been hearing about me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well of course,” she replied. “They’ve been talking about you for weeks. Reverend Gary is especially excited. I’m Victoria Ruin,” she said, holding out her hand for me to shake. I couldn’t stop my blushing even when my hand met hers. It was smooth and felt frail to the touch. “Well aren’t you going to tell me your name?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh y-yes, of course,” I stammered again. “It’s Marcus. Marcus Pale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well Marcus Pale, it is a pleasure to meet you. I’ll have you know that cellular reception is very poor out in these woods. You can, however, use our telephone; it uses a landline connection and shouldn’t give you any issues at all. I can take you to it, if you like?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah sure, I’d appreciate it,” I replied, finally collecting myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She began making her way to the hallway beckoning me to follow with one hand. I caught sight of a large silver ring on her ring finger. I guess she was married, of course she was. A woman that beautiful ought to be married, I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She led me through the door on the left where I originally saw the man retrieve the keys. It led to a long hallway similar to the one up stairs. This hallway was narrower, housing fewer doors all shut tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So tell me, Marcus,&amp;rdquo; she began, &amp;ldquo;Where are you from?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From Arlington,” I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And where is that?” she asked, snickering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Er- sorry, it’s northern Virginia,” I answered, blushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s quite alright,” she said, giggling. “I’ve never been up north before. You’re lucky to be able to travel around. All my life, I’ve been &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, stuck here, that is. I’ve always wanted to venture out, but…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, it’s nothing,” she said, biting her lip. She came to a door on the left and opened it. “Here we are. You can use this phone,” she pointed inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thanked her and entered. The room was tiny, just an upgrade from being considered a pantry. Inside it was a small wooden table cramped to back with an old phone. A single door sat to the side a small window. A strong collection of breads coated the air, making the cramp setting feel even more stuffy. I quickly dialed up my boss and informed him of the situation. He was glad to hear that I arrived alright and went into a speech about ensuring that I represented the company in the best manner possible. Afterwards, he told me to keep up the good work and to call him tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hanging up, I was surprised to find Victoria still waiting for me in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You didn’t have to wait for me,” I told her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled. “Well honestly, I have nothing better to do. I’ve been cooped up in my room for the longest time because of this bloody baby.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” I said. I couldn’t think of any response to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t talk much do you?” she asked, still smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged sheepishly. “What can I say, I’m a quiet guy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a change for sure. You’re different from all the men around here. All they do is talk and lecture. They expect all the woman to just listen. It&amp;rsquo;s quite maddening at times. Are all men of the north like you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blushed at this. “Are you the only the woman here?” I asked, attempting to change the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She scoffed. “Of course not, I don’t know what I do if I was. There are two others: my Aunt Margret and Cousin Sophia; you’ll meet them later at dinner. You are coming, of course?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her emerald eyes gleamed into my own. I could feel my heart rate slowly increase; my face must’ve been bright red from blushing. “Y-yeah, of course I will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her smile widened. “I’ve been bored for the past few days; you want to go on a little adventure?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adventure?” I repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I could give you a tour of the place? I’m sure you wondering where everything is at.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hadn’t thought about the place as a whole. The only area that vaguely interested me was the room behind the double-doors, but I didn’t feel comfortable asking her. “Sure, why not,” I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good,” she said, wrapping her arm around mine. “Where do you want to go first?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her perfume engulfed me, smelling of sweet berries and honey, a smell that was perfect for her. “You want me to decide?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes of course, I don’t want to bore you, showing you &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; nook and cranny,” she answered. I could tell she was reading my face because she added, “Come on, I know there’s a place you’re &lt;em&gt;dying&lt;/em&gt; to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well…” I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes? Just spill it already,” she shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did kind of want to see what was behind those doors in the lobby,” I replied, rubbing my neck in shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doors? You mean the Congregation room?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we can’t, I understand,” I quickly added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nonsense, let’s go,” she said, yanking my arm, pulling me until we reached the lobby again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Victoria?” I asked as she made her way to the doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That symbol on the doors? What is it?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She glanced over to the doors. “That is the symbol of our religion. Well &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; religion anyway. I’ve grown tired of all their prayers and their sermons; it’s all rubbish really.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rubbish? If you don’t care for it then why are you here?” I questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, you’re right, I don’t. I never &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; into it. Ever since I was a little girl, my father forced me to be a part of it. All I have ever known has been Herb Peach County, well apart from brief stay in the UK. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can tell I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like I&amp;rsquo;m from around here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I noticed,&amp;rdquo; I said rubbing my neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have my aunt to thank for that. Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown really tired of all it. Like I said earlier, I want to venture out and see the rest of the world. At least, my home country – I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember it anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you&amp;rsquo;re aunt brought here? What about your mother? What did she have to say about all this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She chuckled softly to herself. “I have no memory of my mother. My father told me she died after I was conceived. I was mainly raised by aunt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, I’m sorry,” I replied softly. &amp;ldquo;I know the feeling. My mother died when I was young too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went quiet for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you just leave?&amp;rdquo; I suggested, breaking the silence. You’re not a little girl anymore. You don’t have to stay here now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled. “If only it were that simple, Marcus. I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to leave, but some things are not that simple,” she said, looking down, rubbing her belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh…” I started. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…” I felt like a complete idiot. My talent of making awkward moments worse was starting to emerge. I was bad at this kind of thing and even worse at comforting someone. It was mainly the reason why I remained quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on. Let’s not ruin your tour with my story,” she interrupted, making her way over to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” I said still feeling guilty. Without even thinking, I asked, “How do we even get in? It’s locked, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smile returned to her face. She turned to me giving off a jokingly-suspicious expression. “How did you know it was locked?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged pathetically, giving off a sheepish grin. “I don’t know, aren’t most of the doors in this place locked?” It was a poor excuse, I knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh-huh. You’re more audacious than you make yourself, Marcus Pale,” she said, placing her ring into the small indent. She twisted her wrist to the right which prompted a soft click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your ring is a key?” I asked in astonishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What, does the north not have keys like these?” she teased, pulling open one of the doors. “Come on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed her behind the door. Inside, the room was huge. The sweet aroma from the lobby seemed to fall flat, sucking out when the door shut. Instead, the singe of smoke and ash filled the air. The lighting was very poor. What little light was present came from the cracks of the doors behind us. The room had long hues for seating lined in rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rows made their way to the front of the room where they stopped in before an altar. From there, a small set of stairs ran up to a large podium – behind it was a flat table on the altar. The table itself was covered in a white cloth. Near the walls stood tall columns of rigged rock as if crudely carved, connecting to the ceiling. In between them stood small marble pillars, each housing a brass bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was this place? I must have spoken the question out-loud because Victoria answered me, “It’s the Congregation room, silly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Was something burning in here?” I asked her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, it’s from the candles; it’s what we use during our services due to the poor lighting,” she answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why not just install lights?” I brought up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well candles are also an important part of our service,” she said, almost as if I was supposed to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; this already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dismissed it though and went further in. I climbed up the stairs of the altar, noticing a figure standing behind the podium. It was hard to make out in the shadows. If it wasn’t for the strands of light behind us, I wouldn’t have even noticed it. I took out my phone and held it up to the figure using its back light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I saw almost caused me tumble down the stairs. In front of me, I saw a tall white statue depicting a strange figure well over my height. Its upper body was of a very fit man, bearing a strong chest and arms. The arms of the statue hung low sweeping near its ankles. It only had three fingers. The legs appeared inverted, its knees caving inward like a goat&amp;rsquo;s legs. Even more disturbing was the head of the statue; it was a hard sight to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head looked to be a sick cross-breed between a dog and a man. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t like the typical depictions seen like in Egypt. No, this head was like a dog and a man’s simultaneously. It had a long narrow snout that seemed to morph into the mouth of a man. Other parts of its face appeared human-like while in others, indescribable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyes were small and beady staring firmly off into the distance. It held a third eye larger in comparison to the other two in the middle of its forehead. Long wild hair ran down its face ending at its shoulders with horns protruding from its back. The statue as a whole stood in a confident pose as if knowing its presence was significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Victoria…?” I felt my voice squeak. I could fell an eerie chill fall down my spine, unable tear my eyes from the horrid view. “W-what the hell is that?” I stammered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking to me, her eyes carried over to the figure. She seemed unfazed and calmly stated, “&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is our god, Lanius, the White Eye of Time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago I posted a story called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;../footsteps&#34;&gt;Footsteps&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; here on /nosleep. There were a number of questions that made me curious about certain details about my childhood and so I spoke with my mother. Exacerbated by my questions she said &amp;ldquo;why don&amp;rsquo;t you just tell them about the goddamn balloons if they&amp;rsquo;re so interested.&amp;rdquo; As soon as she said that, I remembered so much about my childhood that I had forgotten. This story will provide some greater context for the previous story, which I think you should read first. Though the order isn&amp;rsquo;t of vital importance, reading that story first will put you in my place more effectively since I remembered the events of Footsteps first. If you have questions or anything, feel free to ask and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to answer them. Also, both stories are long, so heads up on that. I&amp;rsquo;m just hesitant to leave out any details that might be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was five years old I went to an elementary school that, from what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand, was really adamant about the importance of learning through activity. It was part of a new program designed to allow children to rise at their own pace, and to facilitate this, the school encouraged teachers to come up with really inventive lesson plans. Each teacher was given the latitude to create his or her own themes which would run for the duration of the grade, and all the lessons in math, reading, etc., would be designed in the spirit of the theme. These themes were called &amp;ldquo;Groups&amp;rdquo;. There was a &amp;ldquo;Space&amp;rdquo; group, a &amp;ldquo;Sea&amp;rdquo; group, an &amp;ldquo;Earth&amp;rdquo; group, and the group I was in, &amp;ldquo;Community&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kindergarten in this country, you don&amp;rsquo;t learn much except how to tie your shoes and how to share, so most of it isn&amp;rsquo;t very memorable. I only remember two things very clearly: I was the best at writing my name the right way, and the Balloon Project, which was really the hallmark of the Community group, since it was a pretty clever way to show how a community functioned at a really basic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of this activity. On one Friday (I remember it being Friday because I was excited about the project and it being the end of the week) toward the beginning of the year, we walked into the classroom in the morning and saw that there was a fully-inflated balloon tied off with string taped to each of our desks. Sitting on each of our desks was a marker, a pen, a piece of paper, and an envelope. The project was to write a note on the paper, put it in the envelope, and attach it to the balloon which we could draw a picture on if we wanted. Most of the kids started fighting over the balloons because they wanted different colors, but I started on my note which I had thought a lot about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the notes had to follow a loose structure, but we were allowed to be creative within those boundaries. My note was something like this: &amp;ldquo;Hi! You found my balloon! My name is [Name] and I attend ______________ Elementary school. You can keep the balloon, but I hope you write me back! I like Mighty Max, exploring, building forts, swimming, and friends. What do you like? Write me back soon. Here&amp;rsquo;s a dollar for the mail!&amp;rdquo; On the dollar I wrote &amp;ldquo;FOR STAMPS&amp;rdquo; right across the front, which my mom said was unnecessary, but I thought it was genius, so I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher took a Polaroid of each of us with our balloons and had us put them in the envelope along with our letter. They also included another letter that I assume explained the nature of the project and sincere appreciation for anyone&amp;rsquo;s participation in writing back and sending photos of their city or neighborhood. That was the whole idea&amp;mdash;to build a sense of community without having to leave the school, and to establish safe contact with other people; it seemed like such a fun idea&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple weeks the letters started to roll in. Most came with pictures of different landmarks, and each time a letter would come in, the teacher would pin the picture on a big wall-map we had put up showing where the letter had come from and how far the balloon had traveled. It was a really smart idea, because we actually looked forward to coming to school to see if we had gotten our letter. For the duration of the year we had one day a week where we could write back to our pen-pal or another students&amp;rsquo; pen-pal in case our letter hadn&amp;rsquo;t come in yet. Mine was one of the last to arrive. When I came into the classroom I looked at my desk and once again didn&amp;rsquo;t see any letter waiting for me, but as I sat down the teacher approached me and handed me an envelope. I must have looked so excited because as I was about to open it she put her hand on mine to stop me and said, &amp;ldquo;Please don&amp;rsquo;t be upset.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what she meant&amp;mdash;why would I be upset now that my letter had come? Initially I was mystified that she would even know what was in the envelope, but now I realize that of course the teachers had screened the contents to make sure there was nothing obscene, but all the same&amp;mdash;how could I be disappointed? When I opened the envelope I understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing in the envelope was a Polaroid, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really make out what it was. It looked like a patch of desert, but it was too blurry to decipher; it appeared as if the camera had been moved while the picture was being taken. There was no return address, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even write back if I wanted to. I was crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school year pressed on, and the letters had stopped coming for nearly all of the other students. After all, you can only continue a written correspondence with a Kindergartener for so long. Everyone, including myself, had lost interest in the letters almost completely. Then I got another envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My excitement was rejuvenated, and I reveled in the fact that I was still getting a letter when most of the other pen-pals had abandoned their involvement. It made sense that I received another delivery&amp;mdash;there had been nothing but a blurry picture in the first one, so this was probably to make up for that. But again there was no letter at all&amp;hellip; just another picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was more distinguishable, but I still didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it. The photograph was angled way up, catching the top corner of a building, and the rest of the image was distorted by a lense-flare from the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the balloons didn&amp;rsquo;t travel very far, and because they were all launched on the same day, the board became a bit cluttered, and so the policy for the students still exchanging letters became that they could take the photographs home. My best friend Josh had the second highest number of pictures taken home by the end of the year&amp;mdash;his pen-pal was really cooperative and sent him pictures from all around the neighboring city; Josh took home, I think, four pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took home nearly fifty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The envelopes were all opened by the teacher, but after a while I stopped even looking at the pictures. However, I saved them in one of my drawers that housed my collections of rocks, baseball cards, comic book cards (Marvel Metal cards, for those who might remember), and little miniature baseball batting helmets that I&amp;rsquo;d get out of a vending machine at Winn-Dixie after T-Ball games. With the school year over, my attention turned to other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom had gotten me a small snow cone machine for Christmas that year, and Josh had really coveted it&amp;mdash;so much so that his parents bought him a slightly nicer one for his birthday which was toward the end of the school year. That summer we had the idea that we would set up a snow cone stand to make money; we thought we&amp;rsquo;d make a fortune selling snow cones at one dollar. Josh lived in a different neighborhood, but we eventually decided that my neighborhood would be better because there were a lot of people who cared for their lawns; the yards in my neighborhood were slightly bigger. We did this for five weekends in a row until my mom told us that we had to stop, and I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently come to understand why she did that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fifth weekend, Josh and I were counting our money. Because we both had a machine, we each had a separate stack of money that we put together into one stack and we then split it evenly. We had made a total of sixteen dollars that day, and as Josh paid out my fifth dollar, a feeling of profound surprise consumed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar said &amp;ldquo;FOR STAMPS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh noticed my shock and asked if he had miscounted. I told him about the dollar and he said, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s so cool, man!&amp;rdquo; As I thought about it, I came to agree. The idea that the dollar had made it right back to me after changing so many hands floored me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rushed inside to tell my mom, but my excitement coupled with her being distracted by a phone call made my story incomprehensible and she responded simply by saying &amp;ldquo;Oh wow! That&amp;rsquo;s neat!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated, I ran back outside and told Josh I had something to show him. Back in my room, I opened the drawer and took out the stack of envelopes and showed him some of the pictures. I started with the first picture, and we went through about ten before Josh lost interest and asked if I wanted to go play in the ditch (a dirt ditch down the street from my house) before his mom came to pick him up, so that&amp;rsquo;s what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a &amp;ldquo;dirt war&amp;rdquo; for a while, but it was interrupted several times by rustling in the woods around us. There were raccoons and stray cats that lived in there, but this was making a little too much noise and we traded guesses at what it was in an attempt to scare each other. My last guess was that it was a mummy, but in the end Josh kept insisting that it was a robot because of the sounds that we heard. Before we left, he got a little serious and looked me right in the eyes and said, &amp;ldquo;You heard it didn&amp;rsquo;t you? It sounded like a robot. You heard it too right?&amp;rdquo; I had heard it, and since it sounded mechanical I agreed that it was probably a robot. It&amp;rsquo;s only now that I understand what we heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got back Josh&amp;rsquo;s mom was waiting for him at the kitchen table with my mom. Josh told his mom about the robot; our moms laughed and Josh went home. My mom and I ate dinner, and then I went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t stay in bed for long before I crept out and decided that, due to the day&amp;rsquo;s events, I would revisit the envelopes since now the whole affair seemed much more interesting. I took the first envelope and set it on the floor and set the blurry desert Polaroid on top. I laid the second envelope right next to it and placed the oddly angled Polaroid of a building&amp;rsquo;s top corner on top and did this with each picture until they formed a grid that was about five by ten; I was always taught to be careful with things that I was collecting, even if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure they were valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the pictures gradually became more decipherable. There was a tree with a bird on it, a speed limit sign, power line, a group of people walking into some building. And then I saw something that vexed me so powerfully that I can now, as I write this, distinctly remember feeling dizzy and capable of only a single, repeating thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why am I in this picture?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this photograph of the group of people entering the building I saw myself holding hands with my mother in the very back of the crowd of people. We were at the very edge of the photo, but it was undeniably us. And as my eyes swam over the sea of Polaroids I became increasingly anxious. It was a really odd feeling&amp;mdash;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t fear, it was the feeling you get when you are in trouble. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I was flooded with that feeling, but there I sat floundering in the distinct sense that I had done something wrong. And this feeling only intensified as I looked on at the rest of the photos after the one that had so powerfully struck me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of them were close shots. None of them were only of me. But I was in every single one of them&amp;mdash;off to the side, in the back, bottom of the frame. Some of them only had the tiniest part of my face captured at the very edge of the photo, but nevertheless, I was there. I was always there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. Your mind works in funny ways as a kid, but there was a large part of me that was afraid of getting in trouble simply for still being up. Since I already had the looming feeling of having done something wrong, I decided that I would wait until tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, my mom was off work and spent most of the morning cleaning up around the house. I watched cartoons, I imagine, and waited until I thought it was a good time to show her the Polaroids. When she went out to get the mail I grabbed a couple of the pictures and put them on the table in front of me as I sat waiting for her to come back in. When she returned, she was already opening the mail and threw some junk mail into the trashcan and I said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mom, can you come here for a second? I have these pictures&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just give me a minute, honey. I need to mark these on the calendar.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a minute or two, she came and stood behind me and asked me what I needed. I could hear her shuffling with the mail behind me but I just looked at the Polaroids and told her about them. As I explained more and pointed to the pictures her frequent &amp;ldquo;uh huh&amp;quot;s and &amp;ldquo;ok&amp;quot;s decreased, and she was suddenly completely quiet and only making a little noise with the mail. The next noise I heard from her sounded as if she was trying to catch her breath in a room that had no air left in it. At last her struggling gasps were conquered and she simply dropped the remaining mail on the table and ran to the kitchen to get the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mom! I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about these! Don&amp;rsquo;t be mad at me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the phone pressed to her ear she was walking/running back and forth and shouting into it. I nervously fiddled with the mail sitting next to my Polaroids. The top envelope had something sticking out of it that I thoughtlessly and anxiously pulled on until it came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another Polaroid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confused, I thought that somehow one of my Polaroids had slipped into the stack when she threw the mail down, but when I turned it over and looked at it I realized that I had not seen this one before. To my dismay, it was me, but this one was a much closer shot. I was surrounded by trees and was smiling. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just me, I noticed. Josh was there too. This was us from yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started yelling for my mom who was still screaming into the phone. I repeatedly yelled for her until she finally responded with, &amp;ldquo;What?!&amp;rdquo; and I could only think to ask, &amp;ldquo;Who are you calling?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m talking with the police, honey.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But why? I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to do anything&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She answered me with a response that I never understood until I was forced to revisit these events from the earliest years of my life. She grabbed the envelope off the table and the picture of Josh and I spun and slid, landing next to the other Polaroids in front of me. She held the envelope up to my eyes but I could only look at her and watch as all the color began draining out of her face. With tears welling up in her eyes she said that she had to call the police because there was no postmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months went by with no response. During this time I researched as much as I could about lost episodes. I found out about another alleged &amp;ldquo;lost episode&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;The Flintstones&amp;rdquo;. The story behind this episode was much like other &amp;ldquo;lost episode&amp;rdquo; stories: a special episode of the show aired on an otherwise unused television channel and had gory and surreal content. The main difference between this story and the others was that this one had a somewhat credible outside source. The original forum post had a link to a digitally archived local news article from 1979. The FCC had received complaints from dozens of people claiming to have seen the episode. The complaints came from the Lake Kabetogama region of Minnesota, with most originating from a couple of specific lake resorts. The incident was locally known as the Kabetogama Broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided the next logical step was to contact the FCC for more details. They responded within a week saying that unfortunately they were not at liberty to give out such information. At that moment, I considered filing a Freedom of Information Act request, but decided to take a different route. One of the two lake resorts most heavily involved with the incident was still in operation. I scheduled a vacation from work, and a few weeks later I was on my way to Lake Kabetogama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kleck&amp;rsquo;s Cove was a collection of 15 cabins, a bar-restaurant, and a small boat dock with boats available for lease. I had rented an old A-frame unit and planned to stay for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resort was a nice place to stay. I spent a few days fishing and seeing local attractions. I fell in with a group of regulars who fished at the resort every year. We went on several boat trips before I had enough courage to ask the oldest of them about the Kabetogama Broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh that, funny thing, I actually just missed out on that whole thing. It happened a week before I stayed here in summer of &amp;lsquo;79. I heard a lot about it though. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to talk to Ed about it, he was there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was referring to Ed Kleck, the founder and proprietor of Kleck&amp;rsquo;s Cove. I had considered asking him about the Kabetogama Broadcast before, but wanted to feel out the locals first. However, at this point I decided I was being overly cautious and chose to follow the man&amp;rsquo;s advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kleck was in his late seventies, but his memory was still sharp. He liked to tell stories and I took advantage of this by starting a conversation with him about the history of the resort and the lake. This got him going for a couple hours before I brought up the Kabetogama Broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now why do you wanna know about that?&amp;rdquo; he asked, seeming taken aback. I told him I had read about it on the internet and what the story said. He shrugged and said &amp;ldquo;oh well, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much what happened. Nothing much else to tell really.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if he had seen the episode, to which he responded that he had caught the end of the broadcast after being told about it as it was happening. He said he saw Barney die a horrible and bloody death in some faux-stone age contraption but didn&amp;rsquo;t remember much else. He was reluctant to continue the conversation much further, but assured me that the incident was very real indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pondered all I had learned on my drive home. I had been left with more questions than answers, and didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be getting any closer to tracking down the &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; lost recording. The more I learned, the more new questions came up. Was the disturbing &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; version I had seen connected to the Kabetogama Broadcast or the alleged Batman and Robin lost episode, or was I making connections where there were none? Did that person on YouTube who claimed to have seen the Batman lost episode really see it, or had he just been trolling me? Surely all these claims couldn&amp;rsquo;t be coincidental, but there was no explanation for the existence of these lost episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was churning all this information over in my mind, I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice the vehicle behind me until it was right up on my bumper. I swerved as it made contact, and careened into a ditch. The other car drove on without stopping. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t injured, in fact my airbag hadn&amp;rsquo;t even deployed, but I sat in shock for many, many minutes afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally got my bearings, I called 911 and told them my location based on the nearest mile marker. It took about 45 minutes for a state officer to find me. I told the police what had happened, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to provide details such as the make and color of the car that had hit me or the license plate. I did not tell them what business I was on or my lingering suspicion that the incident had to do with my investigation of the Kabetogama Broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when this world drifts so close to the fabric of reality that I can hear something calling me from beyond that veil. Sometimes when I get too close, I can feel that thing on the other side tugging at the corners of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m worried about Diego. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be taking this so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, I work at the shitty gas station at the edge of our small town, and weird things have been happening for as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been here. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally started to tell some of my stories, and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t caught up yet, I would like to invite you to read parts one and two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned to work after my post yesterday, I was delighted to find a stack of receipt papers sitting neatly on the register counter with notes written in my own shaky hand-writing. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember writing these notes, but then again, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember a lot of things. It is possible that I&amp;rsquo;m working too hard. Or maybe the fumes coming from beneath the gas station are playing tricks on me. Or perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s just another side effect of my condition. At any rate, I&amp;rsquo;m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Or any other animal in any other orifice, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, my handwriting isn&amp;rsquo;t the best. And at times, the scratches on the receipt paper become nearly illegible. So if anything herein seems unbelievable, it&amp;rsquo;s probably because I copied it wrong. With that in mind, this is my best effort at a transcription:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:00 – It&amp;rsquo;s getting dark earlier these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30 – Farmer Junior came into the gas station tonight, asking about the hand plants. I told him that they weren&amp;rsquo;t there anymore. He left his phone number scribbled on the back of a coupon for fifteen-percent off bulk pig feed from an online retailer. I think he&amp;rsquo;s trying to send me a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:00 – I think maybe some kids are playing a prank on me. I found a lawn gnome behind the pork rinds. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much about it, and put him in a box behind the counter. But then I found another matching lawn gnome in the soda case. I added this one to the box as well. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I noticed the third and fourth lawn gnomes that I started to suspect something. I had taken out the garbage and found the gnomes perched atop the branch of a tree next to the dumpster, staring down at me like gargoyles. I used a chair and broom to knock them down, and I put them in the box with the other three. When I got back to my desk, I found a note on my chair written in red ink. It says simply, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in the walls.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t know who wrote it, but the paper smells like oranges and plumeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 – There is a strange scratching noise coming from the tiles above the cash register. I fear Rocco and his brood may have infiltrated the building again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:00 – Farmer Junior called the store. He asked about the hand plants. I assured him that they weren&amp;rsquo;t there anymore and if they ever showed up again, I would call him. I think he&amp;rsquo;s beginning to suspect that I&amp;rsquo;m lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:00 – One of the cultist recruits wandered in from the community in the woods. (They hate it when I call them cultists.) I know the recruits aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to interact with the outside world, but from time to time they will sneak into town, never any further than this gas station, and buy cigarettes. They aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to try and recruit new members until they graduate to the honorable senior cultist status, but this one isn&amp;rsquo;t a very good cultist. I know they aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to have names, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to call this one Marlboro. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you guess why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro stayed in the store for at least half an hour, trying to convince me to go back to the compound with him. (They hate it when I call their home a compound.) He tried to appeal to my logical side, but I let him know politely but firmly that I was not interested in logic. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember when he left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:00 – I found myself digging again. Sometimes, on slow nights, I let myself drift. My mind goes somewhere and when I come to, I wonder: where was I just now? Who was that controlling my body while I was gone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My body did those things I&amp;rsquo;ve done so many times before that I guess it&amp;rsquo;s learned how to do them without me. My body restocked the cigarettes, my body rotated the frozen drink machine, my body scraped the mold off the bottoms of the ice buckets, my body emptied the rat traps, and somewhere along the way, my body found a shovel, went out back, and started digging a hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say my body &amp;ldquo;started&amp;rdquo; digging. I have been, or rather &amp;ldquo;my body&amp;rdquo; has been digging this hole, off and on for the last few months. Usually, I come to after a few shovel-fulls. This time, I added another foot deep before I snapped back to reality and asked myself, &amp;ldquo;what the hell am I doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:30 – I just noticed a door at the end of the hallway past the walk-in cooler. How long have I worked here and never noticed that door before? It seems disappointingly ordinary as far as doors go, except for the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s warm to the touch and feels like it&amp;rsquo;s vibrating. I tried the handle, but it&amp;rsquo;s locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back to my register, I noticed a man in a trench coat standing outside beyond the gas pumps, just outside the reach of our lights, dangerously close to the road. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell if he&amp;rsquo;s looking at me, or if he&amp;rsquo;s looking past the building at the woods on the other side. I wish he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand there like that, stoic and still, with his arms reaching down past his knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scratching against the tiles in the ceiling over the counter is getting louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:45 – A man came into the store, rolling a large white ice chest behind him. He had sunken blue eyes, wiry hair coming from his nose and ears, long boney fingers, and paper-thin skin revealing every blue and green vein beneath the translucent dermis. He wore a bowler cap and smelled like milk. I had definitely never seen him around before. He asked if we would be interested in partnering up with him. He sold ground meat at discount prices, but I told him that our store doesn&amp;rsquo;t do well with the &amp;ldquo;fresh foods&amp;rdquo; category, recommending he try his hand at making jerky. Before he left, he scooped about a pound or so of raw ground meat from the ice chest onto a piece of parchment paper and gave it to me as a &amp;ldquo;sample.&amp;rdquo; Once he had left, I took the meat into the cooler, where I found another lawn gnome waiting for me. I put the gnome into the box with the other seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:00 – Diego just told me something very strange about Kieffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:30 – There was a kid named Spencer Middleton who went to the same high school as me and Kieffer. Spencer was just a year ahead of me, but looked much older and acted much younger. I live in a small town, and small towns get bored. For entertainment, some turn to gossip, some turn to more sinister pass times. The latter often fueled the former. There were rumors around town that Spencer liked to torture and kill animals. Rumors that Spencer&amp;rsquo;s parents and siblings always locked their bedroom doors when they went to sleep at night. The rumors didn&amp;rsquo;t slow down any after the fire at Spencer&amp;rsquo;s house, where Spencer was the only one to escape unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once saw Spencer gleefully stomp on a lizard, throw his head back, and laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some short time after his house caught fire for the second time, Spencer left town. The story went that he had gone off and joined the army. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to think about that, so I simply didn&amp;rsquo;t think about that. I would have been perfectly happy to never think about that, but after all these years I&amp;rsquo;m forced to. Because Spencer Middleton just came into the store and ordered a cup of coffee. He&amp;rsquo;s sitting in one of the booths, talking to Kieffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro, is back. He asked if I could spare him some time to talk about his fake religion. (They hate it when I call it a fake religion.) I told him he had to leave. He seemed upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:45 – Spencer and Kieffer sat around for a while and didn&amp;rsquo;t buy anything but two cups of coffee. When they finally left, I let Diego know. He had been hiding under a blanket in the walk-in cooler, although I can&amp;rsquo;t really understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego explained to me exactly what happened. He had finished his shift a couple nights ago and just left the gas station when he saw Kieffer&amp;rsquo;s SUV pulled over in a ditch at the bottom of the hill. Diego, being the good guy he is, decided to check and see if Kieffer needed any help. He says that when he pulled up and got out of the car, he could hear what sounded like a loud crunching noise coming from just beyond the tree line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego went to investigate. That&amp;rsquo;s when he saw something. When I asked Diego what he saw, he just started speaking Spanish in a fast, panicked sort of way. I don&amp;rsquo;t speak Spanish, but I nodded along empathetically. The only word I could pick up was &amp;ldquo;Strega,&amp;rdquo; which is the name of a liquor we carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever it was that Diego saw, it made him race back to his car as fast as he could and back out quickly, without looking. And that&amp;rsquo;s when he ran over Kieffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego is a good guy. But here he was in a bad situation. He stopped long enough to get out, check on Kieffer, and confirm that he was definitely dead. There was nothing he could do that would change that fact. It was an accident. Diego was on parole. There was that thing in the woods, and Diego had to make a decision. So, he heaved the body into the trunk of his car and drove off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego took me to his car and showed me the body. I can confirm, one hundred percent, that it was Kieffer in the trunk of his car. Not just because of his unmistakable face, but also because of his phone and wallet that were in his pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:00 – I finally got tired of the scratching and pulled our ladder out of storage to see what the racoons were doing in the ceiling, but when I pushed back the tile, the only thing up there was another gnome. That makes one dozen so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:00 – The man in the trench coat is still outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cultist came back in, demanding an audience with me, insisting that if I would just listen to him I would see that his reasoning is superb and flawless, and that I would be a fool not to join him in the perfection of logic and nirvana that is his belief structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agreed to listen to his pitch if he would agree to ask the man in the trench coat to leave. Our hasty verbal contract in place, I steeled myself to listen. Honestly, he did make a few good points, but I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected from a viral thought experiment strong enough to convince perfectly normal people to abandon their real lives and go live in a commune in the woods past the shitty gas station on the edge of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They call themselves &amp;ldquo;mathmetists.&amp;rdquo; They believe that humankind exists to fulfill two moral imperatives: to decrease suffering, and to increase happiness. A successful life increases happiness more than suffering. A decent life decreases suffering more than happiness. How good a person is can be determined by the spread between the happiness increased and the suffering decreased. Obviously, if the individual has a negative spread—that is, if they&amp;rsquo;ve increased happiness less than they&amp;rsquo;ve increased suffering, or if they&amp;rsquo;ve decreased suffering less than they&amp;rsquo;ve decreased happiness—then that means, very simply, that the individual is bad. Therefore, if an individual causes a tremendous amount of happiness and suffering, one can simply determine which was higher, and use this perfect rubric to determine whether that individual was good or bad. Simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathmetists believe that the world has been going about good and bad in the wrong way. For eons, we&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to increase happiness, when instead we should have been focusing on decreasing suffering. As happiness is a fluid concept, and the more happiness you create, the harder it is to sustain, as happiness has a clear set of diminishing returns. Suffering, however, is consistent. Suffering results from happiness coming to an end. Suffering is pure, and eternal. For a mathmetist to be supremely good, they must simply end all suffering. That is why the mathmetists are working on a bomb to destroy the entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By ending all life on earth, they end an infinity of suffering into the future. With every life they avert, an entire lineage of people that would be born into a life of suffering will no longer. Every death is a preemptive mercy-killing. Every happy moment that will no longer occur pales in the face of all the sad moments that are likewise prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, as Marlboro explained, their murder cult believes that killing is a kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him that his ideas were stupid and he was stupid and that now he now had to go tell the man in the trench coat to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30 – The phone rang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is strange for two reasons. First, because it was not the land line. It was the cell phone, even though we do not get cell phone service way out here. And second, because it was the cell phone. The one that I took off of Kieffer&amp;rsquo;s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I was stuck in a bit of a moral quandary ever since Diego confided in me. On the one hand, Diego had killed someone. On the other, it was an accident and Diego&amp;rsquo;s parole officer may not see it that way. I thought I would have more time to figure this out, but when the cell phone started ringing, I knew I had to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak first. The voice on the other line was one I recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have something that belongs to my boss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Spencer Middleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;His cell phone and his wallet,&amp;rdquo; I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What? No! We don&amp;rsquo;t care about that shit! We can buy more phones. We can get more wallets. You know what we want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was right. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was an accident,&amp;rdquo; I explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We know. We want to make a deal. You give it back, and we pretend this whole thing didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can we do that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Absolutely.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30 – Diego came in for his shift at seven and I explained the deal to him. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled, but as I laid it out very clearly, he didn&amp;rsquo;t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We parked Diego&amp;rsquo;s Camry behind the gas station near the growth of handplants and made a point to stand far enough away to not get our ankles grabbed. Kieffer&amp;rsquo;s SUV drove up a few minutes later. Spencer was driving. He and Kieffer got out without a word, sized us up, and opened the back of their vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego popped the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kieffer and I stared at each other, keeping eye-contact the whole time while Diego and Spencer transferred the body from one vehicle to the other. Spencer had a tarp and blanket ready to wrap everything up. When it was over, Kieffer put a hand on my shoulder and whispered in my ear, &amp;ldquo;You done good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they left. Diego started crying as I went back inside the store. It was almost day time, and that&amp;rsquo;s when the new part-timer was supposed to take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:00 – The new part timer is late, and I&amp;rsquo;m overdue for a lunch break. I made the best of my extra time here by putting price stickers on all the lawn gnomes. We&amp;rsquo;re ringing them up as &amp;ldquo;miscellaneous grocery&amp;rdquo; for $9.99 each, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already sold a couple. I&amp;rsquo;m a really good employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:30 – I went to the bathroom and saw a man standing there with his pants at his ankles. He wore checkered boxers and a cowboy hat. He smiled when he saw me and simply said in a somewhat sing-song voice, &amp;ldquo;Come on man. Come onnn with it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the opportunity to ask him something that has been bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you know, is everything going to be ok?&amp;rdquo;
The bathroom cowboy took a second to think, then he pulled up his pants and walked past me, spurs clinking against the bathroom tile. He stopped for a second when he was right next to me and said plainly, &amp;ldquo;I appreciate it.&amp;rdquo; Then he left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly have no idea what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the entirety of the receipt paper notes, but I did make a point to continue keeping a journal. I think this will be a healthy way of chronicling the weird events at the gas station. Maybe this will even help with my condition, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. The next time something strange happens, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll come back and write more. Until then, I guess this is to be continued&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edits: Sorry, upon further inspection, I realized that some of the scribbles on the receipt paper may have been transcribed incorrectly. I also made some adjustments to the spelling and fixed some typos. While I was at it, I added another typo just for the observant reader. Lastly, upon the advice of some of my readers, I removed the part where I listed Farmer Junior&amp;rsquo;s social security number and address. Also, special thanks to the reader that pointed out that &amp;ldquo;Strega&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t even a Spanish word. I asked Diego about it when he came in for his fourth shift today, but Diego simply looked at me blankly and told me that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Part Three</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to leave you soon. If I&amp;rsquo;m to make the most of life on Earth, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to skip town. While I&amp;rsquo;ve had plenty to keep myself entertained, this body just isn&amp;rsquo;t suitable for a run in with the police. It&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time until some nosy neighbour thinks to pick up the phone. With the humidity over the last few days, mummy and daddy are already pretty ripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s something you have to understand: Hell is a big place. I&amp;rsquo;ve given you fair warning about a few of the locations I myself have run into and that will have to do. Even if I wrote a library&amp;rsquo;s worth of novels solely dedicated to mapping out the distinct locations within Dis, I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you everything about the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is give you a bit of information about some of the damned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-slaughter-man&#34;&gt;The Slaughter Man&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to think about all the celebrities you know. How many of them do you reckon would do well in Dis? Not many, I&amp;rsquo;ll wager. Perhaps none. Fame and fortune on Earth doesn&amp;rsquo;t count for shit when you&amp;rsquo;re dead. Very few people are strong enough, mean enough and downright psychotic enough to earn a reputation in Hell. Those few who have what it takes are people you never want to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slaughter Man is one of Hell&amp;rsquo;s legends. A huge, bearded man with filed teeth, bloodshot eyes and foam on his lips. Rumour has it that the day he first emerged from a birthing sac, he was unlucky enough to land at the feet of a slaver tribe. Well those tribesmen chuckled to themselves and readied their clubs and whips, only too happy to take some fresh meat captive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outnumbered a dozen to one, naked, unarmed and brand new to Hell, most people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand a chance. If you believe the stories, the Slaughter Man shrugged off the clubs battering against him and the whips cutting into his flesh as though they were insect bites. He picked up the first slaver, put his hand into the man&amp;rsquo;s mouth and pulled his jaw right off his skull. He moved onto another, then another, tearing them apart with his bare hands until the survivors turned and fled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows for sure who he was in life. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard theories though, the most popular one being that he was the berserker of Stamford Bridge. Supposedly, a single Viking held up the English army single-handed. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter that he could never win, that he was outnumbered, that his enemies had better weapons and armour. He stood on that bridge and he fought. By the time he was brought down, he&amp;rsquo;d killed no less than forty men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how true any of this is. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen the Slaughter Man for myself and I don&amp;rsquo;t fucking want to. What I can tell you for sure is that people don&amp;rsquo;t become legendary in Hell without good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d guess that the only one who knows the truth is the Slaughter Man himself and he isn&amp;rsquo;t saying anything. Since the day he arrived in Hell, he&amp;rsquo;s only spoken once. The fleeing slavers heard it as the Slaughter Man tore their tribe apart. Naked, bloody and surrounded by corpses, the Slaughter Man looked up to the storm-wracked sky and bellowed a single word&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Valhalla!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hellhounds&#34;&gt;Hellhounds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about a little story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t new to Hell. I&amp;rsquo;d made myself some clothes and a wooden club, found shelter and had a big slab of meat roasting over a campfire. The only thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t have was a tribe. The area I&amp;rsquo;d been birthed in seemed slummy even for Dis; all half-collapsed hovels and mud huts. Iron was scarce, barely enough to make myself a water bowl. All in all, not a good spot for a tribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan was simple enough. I&amp;rsquo;d have a decent meal, carve myself a shiv or two in case I lost my club, then find somewhere more or less dry to sleep. After that, I&amp;rsquo;d set off to look for a tribe. Even the mildest tribal initiations result in a few scars and a broken nose, so I wanted to be as well rested as I could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep in Hell is both vital and dangerous. There&amp;rsquo;s a knack to finding somewhere that&amp;rsquo;s simultaneously sheltered, hidden and with access to an escape route. Even then, you never get more than a few hours at a time. In Hell, the slightest suspicious noise should scare the shit out of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low, throaty growl definitely counts as a suspicious noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leapt out of my impromptu nest of skins and wood, raised my club and returned the growl with one of my own. A woman had crept into my building and was staring at me with dilated pupils. She looked to be in a bad way, skinny, naked and covered in weeping sores. Her lips peeled back to reveal broken and jagged teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me all of a second to size her up. She&amp;rsquo;d been living rough for days or weeks. Judging from her protruding ribs and bloated stomach, she was well on her way to dying of starvation. So, she was weak, hungry and didn&amp;rsquo;t even have a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve already eaten,&amp;rdquo; I said, relaxing a little and giving my club a few practice swings. &amp;ldquo;No sense in letting you go to waste though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a step towards her and she bolted. Just turned right around and scampered away in a strange, animal gait. I took off after her, certain that I could outpace her. Even if there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much meat on her, bones can still be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chased her through a few streets, struggling to keep my footing on the muddy ground. When I finally got close enough to swing my club, she stopped dead. The suddenness of it caught me off guard and I tripped over her, losing my club as I fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She howled in triumph, a sound that was echoed by a dozen other throats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day, I learned two things about the Hellhounds, the people who lose their minds and become little more than beasts after enduring centuries in Hell. Firstly, they have the necessary animal cunning to hunt as a pack. Secondly, human teeth and fingernails are perfectly capable of ripping flesh from the bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-surgeons&#34;&gt;The Surgeons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern doctors rarely thrive in Hell. Academia and reliance on technology don&amp;rsquo;t leave you in the best state to endure the endless violence and brutality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are exceptions though. The people who learned to sew their friends back together amid the machinegun fire of the Somme. Shamans, witch doctors and holy men who endured famine and warfare. Survivalists who knew how to cauterise their own wounds in the middle of a forest. Those are some of the people who might just be strong enough to ply their trade to the damned. After all, working knowledge of basic medicine is just one of those things that&amp;rsquo;s beyond a lot of the meatheads roaming Dis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Hell&amp;rsquo;s surgeons find a tribe as soon as they&amp;rsquo;re able. Their tools might be crude but they soon learn to make do. Flint, slate and shards of glass serve as their scalpels. They make thread from human hair and needles from slivers of iron. Whenever a member of the tribe has an infected sore, a surgeon will be the one to drain the pus. A tribal surgeon could well save your life &amp;hellip; but they&amp;rsquo;ll do it without anaesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the freelance surgeons, the people who try to go it alone. They make themselves a uniform, the theory being that the damned will recognise them if they all look alike. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work but then you can&amp;rsquo;t expect much logic from people who&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of how many times they&amp;rsquo;ve died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, fashions change over time. I&amp;rsquo;m told that freelancers wore headdresses and bone necklaces at one point. The current trend is to mimic Venetian plague doctors by donning a beaked mask and wearing a long coat of fire-blackened skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freelancers are rare. Very rare in fact. You&amp;rsquo;ll see thousands of the damned for every freelance surgeon you come across. When you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; come across one, be fucking careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, surgeons don&amp;rsquo;t get a free pass in Hell. The damned are more likely to attack a freelancer than they are to barter their tools, clothes or slaves in exchange for his services. You can&amp;rsquo;t be certain if the man in the bird mask and black coat is really a surgeon or somebody who murdered a surgeon and took his clothes. Perhaps they made the outfit themselves in order to draw the weak and the wounded close. Advertising doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work as intended in Dis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the freelancer turns out to be genuine, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you an excuse to drop your guard. Freelance surgeons aren&amp;rsquo;t usually the most stable people. Put another way, freelancers are usually sadistic fucking psychopaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; stitch you back together and send you on your way. They might also decide it would be more interesting if they stitched you to somebody else. They might think paying an arm and a leg for their service should be taken literally. They might turn out to be some wannabe serial killer who&amp;rsquo;s yet to find their way to Skin Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each freelancer trying to do a tough job in a tougher place, there are a dozen or so Mengeles who want to try out their toys on somebody too injured to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick with your tribe&amp;rsquo;s surgeon if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have one. Failing that, learn to patch up your own wounds. Trust me, if you&amp;rsquo;re able to read, you&amp;rsquo;ve already got the intellectual advantage over a lot of Hell&amp;rsquo;s residents. Universal education &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; pretty recent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freelancers aren&amp;rsquo;t worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cambions&#34;&gt;Cambions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest with you here, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if cambions actually exist. What I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you is something that somebody else told me. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to decide if it&amp;rsquo;s true or not. Personally, I really fucking hope it isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People rape one another in Hell. It happens a lot. If you&amp;rsquo;re not strong enough, it&amp;rsquo;ll happen a lot to you. The good news for the ladies out there is that damned men fire blanks. You&amp;rsquo;ll almost never be impregnated. I say &amp;ldquo;almost never&amp;rdquo; because, if you believe the stories, there&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly slim chance that a couple of those little swimmers will be awake and looking for an egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to put this in perspective, we&amp;rsquo;re talking conjoined twins levels of unlikeliness here and that&amp;rsquo;s just conception. The chances of a pregnant woman surviving the full nine months in Hell are probably conjoined triplets levels of unlikely. You&amp;rsquo;re talking about a perfect storm of beating the odds here &amp;hellip; but this is eternity. A monkey randomly mashing keys on a typewriter will eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare if it goes at it for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of that perfect storm, of those monkeys with their typewriters, is a cambion. A child conceived and born in Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying they exist, okay? I&amp;rsquo;m saying I&amp;rsquo;ve met somebody who swears its true and that he&amp;rsquo;s seen a cambion for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see babies in their birthing sacs from time to time. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just a body, occasionally you see one drowning. Most of the damned ignore them. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t survive a day on the streets even if you could afford to devote your full attention to them. Better to leave them be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only the really fucked up people who cut through the sacs and&amp;hellip; Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to finish that thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting sidetracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this cambion who may or may not have existed, apparently looked like a normal child. It cried, it shit and it sucked its mother&amp;rsquo;s tits just like a regular baby would. The mother was part of a tribe and they&amp;rsquo;d been able to protect her throughout her pregnancy. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you why. Curiosity perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was born, the whole tribe gathered around to have a look. Among them was the man who told me this story, somebody I&amp;rsquo;d meet years later and eventually kill. This man cut the baby&amp;rsquo;s cord and lifted it up to his face. Every man in the tribe had raped the mother at one point or another and he wanted to see if the child looked anything like him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cambion looked like a normal child in every way but one. Its eyes were dead. Lifeless, like a doll&amp;rsquo;s. Sure, the kid was alive. It wriggled and cried like a normal baby. Those eyes were wide open though, not scrunched closed like a new-born&amp;rsquo;s eyes should be. Wide open, empty, doll&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that story is true, I don&amp;rsquo;t blame the tribe for killing the child. Something like that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, I&amp;rsquo;m done. I have to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the point where people like to have things nicely tied up. A few dragons slain, a few maidens saved. At the very least, you could expect some kind of moral lesson to think over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that, in this case, that sort of thing is missing the point. There are no dragons to slay, no morals to learn. We do not live happily ever after. There&amp;rsquo;s no grand revelation, no clever twist, no purpose, no redemption, no hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s only eternity among our own kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Chapter 3: Trance</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was still pretty shook up from the last level when I started &amp;ldquo;Trance&amp;rdquo;. Trance&amp;rsquo;s
map music did nothing to ease the tension. As for how to describe it&amp;hellip; have you
ever heard the theme from Videodrome? That&amp;rsquo;s the closest thing I can think of it
to compare it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked to see who the new monster was, and it was Orga. A monster who didn&amp;rsquo;t
make his film debut until 2000, appearing in a game made in 1988.
So much for my theories about Titanosaurus and Biollante. There&amp;rsquo;s no way this
game was made in 1988!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/trance-2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/trance-2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Trance board&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those guys at Toho may be smart, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure they couldn&amp;rsquo;t see that far into
the future. If they could, they never would have gave Roland Emmerich the
rights to make a Godzilla movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, this had to be a hack of some kind. Which just opened up even more questions.
Who made this hack? When? How ? And most importantly, why? The &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo; was the
question that bothered me most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My immediate assumption was to think Billy did this to pull a joke on me. But
that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be right either. Billy didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to make a ROM hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if he did, he&amp;rsquo;d probably just do something simple and stupid, like replacing
all the monsters with crudely drawn genitalia. Unless Billy had amazing game
editing skills, and a serious dark streak to his imagination that he never told
me about, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t have made this. Is it even possible to put a hacked ROM
into a cartridge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from all that, my eye was drawn to a new icon on the map: a question mark.
I was really curious as to what it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re also curious, So I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the &amp;ldquo;Quiz Levels&amp;rdquo; now, since this
was when they start appearing. There was one of these per map from here on,
and they always appeared near the start of the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start on a &amp;ldquo;Quiz Level&amp;rdquo;, you appear on a screen like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/like-dogs.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/like-dogs.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Quiz level asking the player: &amp;ldquo;Do you like dogs?&amp;rdquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there&amp;rsquo;s a question at the top, a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; button, and a
emoticon in the center. I refer to the emoticon as &amp;ldquo;Face&amp;rdquo; (real creative, I know),
and for convenience, I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to Face as the one asking the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music for the quiz levels was a track actually in the game, it&amp;rsquo;s the one
that plays when you try to use the &amp;ldquo;Gh1d0ra&amp;rdquo; cheat and get sent to an unplayable
level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face asks you twelve &amp;ldquo;Yes or No&amp;rdquo; questions, and you move your monster to the
buttons for your answer. When you answer, the question disappears and Face
changes expressions for about eight seconds, then he goes back to neutral
and a new question comes up. There was no time limit, nor any right or
wrong answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face has no respect for the player&amp;rsquo;s personal boundaries, and will sometimes
ask deeply disturbing and personal questions, For example: (Do you like hurting
people?) (Have you ever killed/raped anyone?) (Have you been molested by a family
member?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other times he would ask questions that were either mind-numbingly stupid (Is
the Sun hot?) (Is water wet?) or just flat out ridiculous (Does your dog like the
President?) and maybe once per quiz, Face would ask you a question about the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With one exception, Face&amp;rsquo;s expression changes seemed to have no effect on the game,
except for indicating what the game creator thought of your answer. His reactions
rarely made any sense, and at first I thought they were randomly generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions never followed a pattern, Face never stayed on the same subject for
more than two questions. Early on, there were questions that made me think Face
was building up to something, only to then ask some stupid garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the expressions of Face that I saw while playing. I&amp;rsquo;ll separate
them into two categories: The expressions I understood,
and the expressions I didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First are the expressions I understood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/expressions.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/expressions.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Face&amp;rsquo;s Expressions&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutral, his default expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angry (If you try to attack Face, his expression changes to this, but nothing
else happens)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maniacal (Face made this expression when he was being an asshole. You&amp;rsquo;ll see
what I mean later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annoyed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guilty/Hurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/expressions-2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/expressions-2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Face&amp;rsquo;s other expressions&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of these only appeared once (Numbers #1 and #12), and I suspected they might
have been in-jokes from the creator. Their respective questions were &amp;ldquo;Do you
like Ice Cream?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Are you a tough guy?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the questions in the first Quiz: Luckily, I had a notepad and pen handy.
I have problems remembering things, so I often carry one around to jot things
down, and sometimes I doodle in it when I&amp;rsquo;m bored. So when the first quiz
started I thought I&amp;rsquo;d record what happened. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the president good?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Angry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve explained all that, time for the gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Quiz level, I tried the new green temple icon first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/greentemple.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/greentemple.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Green temple&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow. Maybe this is why the game was so weird&amp;mdash;one of the designers was clearly
drugged out of his mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jokes aside, I was quite impressed by the graphics of this level, as disorienting
as they were (But I hate those creepy, blank staring statue faces). The music had
a hypnotic, Indian techno vibe to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two new enemies in this level: a flying ghost type thing with a trunk,
and a bat with a horse skull for a face. They appear at random, but I was lucky
to get a screencap of them both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/greentempleenemy.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I proceeded to a blue mountain level, expecting another nice, calm stroll.
I took my time walking through, and was completely taken by surprise when this
happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/notmogueraattack.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/notmogueraattack.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Not-Moguera attack&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not-Moguera came speeding towards me and took off quite a bit of health with his
tentacle screws! It only took me two minutes to kill him without having to worry
about a time limit, but the boss monsters NEVER showed up in the scrolling levels
in the normal game. I was worried as to what other rules the game would break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another blue mountain stage, it was time to fight Not-Varan, whose
replacement was one of the most bizarre things in the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/notvaran.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/notvaran.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Not-Varan replacement&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strange creature attacks you by kicking, and also opening up his chest and
firing heat-seeking missiles. &amp;hellip;I still don&amp;rsquo;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/notvaranmissile.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/notvaranmissile.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Not-Varan chest missles&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missiles were sometimes a pain to deal with, but I found out you could tail
whip them out of the way. Not-Varan was probably the easiest of the monster
replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same could not be said for Not-Hedorah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/nothedorah.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/nothedorah.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Not-Hedorah&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently the source of the horse-bats, Not-Hedorah was the most aggravatingly
difficult monster to fight yet. Mostly because of his special ability: He could
shriek and summon a small swarm of those horse-bat things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there&amp;rsquo;s only two in the screencap, but every time he did this, about ten
would arrive. The AI took advantage of the distraction and attacked twice as
fast while the horse-bats were flying around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/nothedorah2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/nothedorah2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Not-Hedorah horse-bats&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once that annoyance was over with, I went through a green temple level to kill
some enemies to restore my health. Interestingly, none of the horse bats showed
up after Not-Hedorah was killed. And that was when I got an idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If killing all the monsters makes the red face show up, what would happen if I
avoid fighting Orga, and go straight to the base?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I gave that a try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/trance3.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/trance3.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Attempt&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/wontwork.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/wontwork.png&#34;  alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;There is no monster here,&amp;rdquo; won&amp;rsquo;t work&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game told me there was no monster there when I tried to start the base level.
And immediately afterward, the game took control of my Godzilla piece and moved
it in front of Orga. My little trick didn&amp;rsquo;t work, so I tried to prepare myself
for another chase. But first, I had to beat Orga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/confrontingorga.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/confrontingorga.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Confronting Orga&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight with Orga confirmed another thing: Whoever created this game hack was
clearly a Godzilla fan. Not only because they picked a monster like Orga, but
because they actually implemented something that happened in &lt;em&gt;Godzilla 2000&lt;/em&gt; in
a really neat way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/orgalaser.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/orgalaser.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Orga&amp;rsquo;s laser&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orga&amp;rsquo;s primary attacks were a punch and a heat beam from his shoulder cavity.
But once you had got him down to half his health, he did something new: He would
expand his jaws and try to swallow Godzilla, in the process stealing your health
and energy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/orgaeat.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in doing so, he gave himself a new weakness: firing a heat beam into his mouth
would take a devastating four bars off his life meter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that weakness revealed I soon beat Orga, and despite how much I had hoped
otherwise, the red face appeared on the map where the base was, and the music
stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-3-trance/trancered.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I readied myself as best I could. I started the level, and seeing that it was
basically the same as the first, I didn&amp;rsquo;t waste a millisecond before I started
hauling ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soon encountered obstacles in the form of the ground tile, suspended in air.
Most of them you could jump over or destroy, others you had to crouch under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About forty seconds into it I heard the horrible bellowing roar and saw the spider
beast following close behind me. Stacks of obstacles barely slowed it down, it
would back up and then charge its way through them, smashing them into bits.
And when the smaller obstacles got in its way, it would expand his jaws and
swallow them whole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was afraid, but with fast thinking and faster button pressing I escaped him yet
again. I felt really excited, and so I laughed and said &amp;ldquo;Not this time, asshole!&amp;rdquo;
I decided to take a screencap to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I said that sentence, just before the level ended, the monster did
something that made my blood run cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wave of mortal terror overtook me again, and I sure as hell wasn&amp;rsquo;t laughing
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took another screencap of the next level title, right before I rushed to the
bathroom to splash some water on my face. (And to take a piss that I nearly failed
to contain when that fucking thing looked at me.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, once again, you guys have blown me away with your staggering amount of responses to my stories! There&amp;rsquo;s no way I can respond to each of you individually, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to address some common things again, and then move on to the stories. I&amp;rsquo;m going to write as many as I can think of, in addition to my friend&amp;rsquo;s stories, and I will probably not update again until I get a chance to answer some questions that I myself have for my superiors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so the common questions I found you all had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not comfortable talking about where exactly I work, unfortunately. In all reality, some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned here could get me in a lot of trouble or fired, so it&amp;rsquo;s best if I just don&amp;rsquo;t discuss too much. I will say that I&amp;rsquo;m in the United States, and in an area that is comprised of a great deal of wilderness. We&amp;rsquo;re talking hundreds of miles of thick forest, with a mountain range and a few lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a great amount of interest in the stairs, and luckily for you guys, my friend has a story that I think you&amp;rsquo;ll all be very interested in. I&amp;rsquo;ll go into that more at the end of this update. As for whether or not I have ever thought of asking my superiors about them, I have, but again, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk my job. However, one of my former superiors no longer works as an SAR officer, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible that he may be willing to talk to me about it. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking to him later in the week, and I will let you all know what comes of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as advice on becoming an SAR officer goes, I think the best advice I can give is to contact your local Forest Service office and see if they offer any training courses, or what the qualifications are. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this for years, and I started out as a volunteer helping on SAR operations. It&amp;rsquo;s a great job, despite the occasional tragic situations, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first happened on a case that I went out on right after I got out of training, and was still pretty new to everything. Before I took this job, I was a volunteer, so I had a basic idea of what to expect, but on those calls you&amp;rsquo;re mostly dealing with finding lost people after vets have already found signs of them. As an SAR officer, you go out for all kinds of cases, from animal bites to heart attacks. This case got called in early in the morning, from a young couple who were up on one of the trails that goes by the lake. The husband was completely hysterical, and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t really figure out what was going on. We could hear the woman screaming in the background, and he was begging us to come up there right away. When we get there, we see him holding his wife, and she’s got something in her arms. She&amp;rsquo;s screaming these awful, almost animal-like screams, and he&amp;rsquo;s sobbing. He sees us and he screams at us to help them, to please get an ambulance up there. Now obviously, we can&amp;rsquo;t just drive an ambulance up the walking path, so we ask him if his wife needs help, or if she can walk on her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s still hysterical, but he manages to tell us that it&amp;rsquo;s not his wife that needs help. I go over while one of the vets tries to calm him down, and I ask the wife what&amp;rsquo;s going on. She&amp;rsquo;s rocking, holding something, and just shrieking, over and over. I crouch down and see that whatever she&amp;rsquo;s holding, it&amp;rsquo;s covering her with blood. That&amp;rsquo;s when I notice the sling on her front and my heart sinks. I ask her to tell me what&amp;rsquo;s going on, and I sort of pry her arms gently open so I can see what she&amp;rsquo;s holding. It&amp;rsquo;s her baby, obviously dead. His head is caved in on one side, and he&amp;rsquo;s covered in scratches. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen dead bodies before, but something about this whole situation hits me hard. I have to take a second to compose myself, and I get up and go get one of the other vets, who was standing by. I tell him that it&amp;rsquo;s a dead kid, and he sort of pats my shoulder and tells me he&amp;rsquo;ll deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took us over an hour to get this woman to let us see her kid. Every time we try to take him from her, she flips out and tells us we can&amp;rsquo;t have him, that he&amp;rsquo;ll be okay if we just leave her alone and let her help him. But eventually, one of the vets manages to calm her down, and she gives us the body. We took it back to the med area, but when the EMTs showed up, they told us that there was never any hope of saving the kid. He&amp;rsquo;d died instantly from the trauma to his head. I was good buddies with one of the nurses who met them at the hospital, and she told me later what had happened. Turns out the couple had been walking with the baby in the sling, and they stopped because the kid was fussing. The dad takes the kid and is holding him, looking out over this little gully by the path. The mom comes to stand next to him, but she ends up stepping on a loose patch of soil, and she trips. She falls into the dad, who drops the kid, who ends up falling about twenty feet down this little gully onto the rocks at the bottom. The dad climbed down and recovered the kid, but he&amp;rsquo;d fallen right on his head, and was dead by the time he got there. The baby was only about fifteen months old. It was a total freak accident, a series of events that coalesced into the worst possible outcome. Probably one of the more awful calls I&amp;rsquo;ve been on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a lot of animal bites in my time as an SAR officer, mostly because there aren&amp;rsquo;t that many animals that come around the area. While there are bears in the area, they tend to stay pretty far away from people, and sightings are highly unusual. Most of the animals you&amp;rsquo;ll see are small ones, like coyotes, raccoons, or skunks. What we do see frequently, though, are moose. And let me tell you, moose are nasty fuckers. They&amp;rsquo;ll chase after anything for any reason, and god help you if you get in between a female and its baby. One of the more amusing calls was of a guy who&amp;rsquo;d gotten chased down by an absolutely massive male moose, and was stuck up a tree. Took us almost an hour to get him down, and when he was finally on solid ground again, he looks at me and says: &amp;lsquo;God damn. Them fuckers is big up close.&amp;rsquo; I guess that&amp;rsquo;s not really a scary story, but we still laugh about that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know how I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten this story, but it is, by far, the scariest thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me. I guess maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve tried so long to forget about it that it just didn&amp;rsquo;t come to mind right away. As someone who spends literally all of their time in the woods, you don&amp;rsquo;t ever want to let yourself get scared of being alone, or out in the middle of nowhere. That&amp;rsquo;s why when you have experiences like this, you tend to just forget about them and move on. This is, to date, the only thing that&amp;rsquo;s ever made me really seriously consider if this job is the right one for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t really like talking about it much, but I&amp;rsquo;ll do the best I can to remember it all. As I recall, this took place right at the end of spring. It was a typical lost-child call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A four-year-old girl had wandered away from her family&amp;rsquo;s campsite, and had been missing for about two hours. Her parents were completely despondent, and told us what most parents do: my kid would never wander away, she&amp;rsquo;s so good about staying close, she&amp;rsquo;s never done anything like this before, etc. We assure the parents that we&amp;rsquo;ll do everything we can to find her, and we spread out in a standard search formation. I was partnered with one of my good buddies, and we were sort of casually holding conversation while we hiked. I know it sounds callous, but you do sort of become desensitized when you&amp;rsquo;ve done this long enough. It becomes the norm, and I think to a certain extent you have to learn to desensitize yourself in order to work this job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We search for a good two hours, going well beyond where we think she&amp;rsquo;d be, and we come out of a small valley when something makes us both stop in unison. We freeze and look at each other, and there&amp;rsquo;s almost a sensation like a plane depressurizing. My ears pop, and I have this odd sensation of having dropped about ten feet. I start to ask my buddy if he felt that, but before I can, we hear the loudest sound I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard in my life. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like a freight train passing directly by us, but it&amp;rsquo;s coming from every direction at once, including above and below us. He screams something to me, but I can&amp;rsquo;t hear him over this deafening roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably freaked out, we look all around us, trying to find the source of the sound, but neither of us sees anything. Of course, my first thought is a landslide, but we&amp;rsquo;re not near any cliffs, and even if we were, it would have hit us by now. The sound goes on and on, and we&amp;rsquo;re trying to yell to each other, but even standing close together, we can&amp;rsquo;t hear anything but this sound. Then, as suddenly as it starts, it stops, like someone threw a switch and cut it off. We stand there for a second, perfectly still, and slowly, the normal sounds of the woods come back. He asks me what the fuck just happened, but I just kind of shrug, and we stand there looking at each other for a minute. I get on the radio and ask if anyone else just heard the end of the fucking world, but no one else hears it, even though we&amp;rsquo;re all within shouting distance of each other. My buddy and I just sort of shrug it off and keep going. About an hour later, we all check up on the radios, and no one&amp;rsquo;s found the little girl. Most of the time, we won&amp;rsquo;t search when it gets dark, but because we don&amp;rsquo;t have any kind of lead on her, a few of us decide to keep going, including me and my buddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep close together, and we’re calling out for her every couple of minutes. At this point, I’m hoping beyond hope that we find her, because while I may not like kids, the idea of them being out all alone in the dark is awful. The woods can be intimidating to kids in the daylight; at night, well, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole different beast. But we&amp;rsquo;re not seeing any signs of her, or getting any responses, and around midnight, we decide to turn around and head back to the rendezvous point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re about halfway back when my buddy stops and shines his light to the right of us, into a really thick deadfall, or group of dead trees. I asked him if he&amp;rsquo;s heard a response, but he just told me to be quiet a second and listen. I do, and in the distance, I can hear what sounded like a kid crying. We both call the girl&amp;rsquo;s name and listen for any kind of response, but it&amp;rsquo;s just this really faint crying. We head in the direction of this deadfall and go around it, calling her name over and over. As we get closer to the crying, I start getting this weird feeling in my gut, and I tell my buddy that something isn’t right. He tells me he feels the same way, but we can&amp;rsquo;t figure out what it is. We stop where we are, and call the girl&amp;rsquo;s name again. And at the same time, we both figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crying is on a loop. It&amp;rsquo;s the same little hitching sob, then wail, then quiet hiccup, repeated over and over. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly the same every time, and without saying another word, we both take off running. It’s the only time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever lost my composure like that, but something about it was so incredibly wrong, and neither of us wanted to stay out there anymore. When we got back to the rendezvous, we asked if anyone else had heard anything strange, but no one else knew what we were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds sort of anti-climactic, but that call fucked me up for a long time. As for the little girl, we never found a trace of her. We keep an eye out for her, and all the other people who we&amp;rsquo;ve never found, but frankly I doubt we&amp;rsquo;ll ever find anything. Of the missing persons calls I&amp;rsquo;ve gone out on, only a handful have ever resulted in a complete disappearance, meaning no trace of the person and nobody ever found. But sometimes, finding a body just leads to more questions than answers. Here are some of the bodies we&amp;rsquo;ve found that have become infamous in our team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A teenage boy whose remains were recovered almost a year after he vanished. We found the top of his skull, two finger bones, and his camera almost forty miles from where he was last seen. The camera, sadly, was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pelvis of an older man who had vanished a month earlier. That was all we found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower jaw and right foot of a two-year-old boy on the highest peak of a ridge in the southern part of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of a ten-year-old girl with Down&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome, almost twenty miles from where she&amp;rsquo;d vanished. She had died of exposure three weeks after going missing, and all of her clothes were intact except for her shoes and jacket. There were berries and cooked meat in her stomach when they did the autopsy. The coroner said it appeared as if someone had been taking care of her. No suspects were ever identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frozen body of a one-year-old baby, found a week after vanishing in the hollow trunk of a tree ten miles from the area he was seen last. There was fresh milk found in his stomach, but his tongue was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single vertebra and right kneecap of a three-year-old girl, found in the snow almost twenty miles from the campground her family had been at the previous summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on to a couple of the stories my friend told me. I mentioned that you were all interested in the stairs, and you&amp;rsquo;re in luck: he&amp;rsquo;s had a closer encounter with them. Though he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any explanation for them, he does have a bit more experience with them than I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My buddy has been an SAR officer for about seven years. He started when he was a junior in college, and he had a very similar experience when he first encountered the stairs. His trainer told him almost the same thing mine did, which was to never go near, touch, or ascend them. For the first year, he did just that, but apparently, his curiosity got the better of him, and on one call, he broke away from the line and went to go check a set of them out. He said they were about ten miles from the path where a teenage girl had vanished, and the dogs were following a scent. He was on his own, lagging behind the main group, when he saw a set of stairs off to his left. They looked like they were from a new house, because the carpeting was pristine and white. He said that as he got closer, he didn&amp;rsquo;t feel any different, or hear any weird noises. He was expecting something to happen, like bleeding from his ears or collapsing, but he got right up next to them and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything. The only thing he said that was odd was that there was absolutely no debris on the steps. No dirt, leaves, dust, anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there didn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any signs of animal or insect activity in the immediate area, which he found strange, too. It was less like things were avoiding them, and more like they just happened to be in a relatively barren part of the forest. He touched the stairs, and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything except that sort of sticky feeling you get from new carpet. Making sure his radio was on, he slowly climbed them; he said it was terrifying, because the way they&amp;rsquo;d been stigmatized, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what was going to happen to him. He joked that half of him expected to be teleported to some other dimension and the other half was watching for a UFO to come swooping down. But he got to the top with little event, and he stood there looking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he said, the longer he stood on the top step, the more he felt like he was doing something very, very wrong. He described it as the feeling you&amp;rsquo;d get if you were in a part of a government building you have no business being in. As if someone was going to come and arrest you, or shoot you in the back of the head at any second. He tried to brush it off, but the feeling got stronger and stronger, and that&amp;rsquo;s when he realized that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything anymore. The sounds of the forest were gone, and he couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear his own breathing. It was like some kind of weird, awful tinnitus, but more oppressive. He climbed back down and rejoined the search, and didn&amp;rsquo;t mention what he&amp;rsquo;d done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he said, the weirdest part came after. His trainer was waiting back at the welcome center after the search ended for the day, and he cornered my buddy before he could leave. He said his trainer had this look of intense anger, and he asked what was wrong. &amp;lsquo;You went up them, didn&amp;rsquo;t you.&amp;rsquo; My buddy said it wasn&amp;rsquo;t phrased as a question. He asked how his trainer knew. The trainer just shook his head. &amp;lsquo;Because we didn&amp;rsquo;t find her. The dogs lost her scent.&amp;rsquo; My buddy asked what that had to do with anything. The trainer asked how long he&amp;rsquo;d been on the stairs, and my buddy said no more than a minute. The trainer gave him this really awful, almost dead-eyed look, and told him that if he ever went up another set of stairs again, he&amp;rsquo;d be fired. Immediately. The trainer walked away, and I guess he&amp;rsquo;s never answered any of the questions my buddy has asked him about it since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My buddy has been involved in a lot of missing persons cases where there’s never been a trace of them found. I mentioned David Paulides, and my buddy said he can confirm that those stories are, for the most part, accurate. He said that most of the time, if the person isn&amp;rsquo;t found right away, they&amp;rsquo;re either never found, or they&amp;rsquo;re found weeks, months, or years later, in places they can&amp;rsquo;t possibly have gotten to. One story he told me really stood out that involved a five-year-old boy with a severe mental disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little boy vanished from a picnic area in the late fall. In addition to the mental disability, he was also physically handicapped, and his parents explained over and over that he simply could not have vanished. It was impossible. Someone had to have taken him. My buddy said they searched for this kid for weeks, going miles out of the accepted range, but it was like he&amp;rsquo;d never been there. The dogs couldn&amp;rsquo;t pick up his scent anywhere, not even in the picnic area where he’d apparently vanished from. Suspicion fell on the parents, but it was pretty clear that they were devastated, and hadn&amp;rsquo;t done anything sinister to their kid. The search was concluded about a month later, and my buddy said everyone had pretty much forgotten it by later in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was out on a training op in the snow on one of the higher peaks when he came across something in the snow. He said he saw it from far away at first, and when he got closer, he realized it was a shirt, frozen and sticking part way out of the powder. He recognized it as belonging to the kid, because it had a distinctive pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About twenty yards away, he found the kid&amp;rsquo;s body, lying partially buried in the snow. My buddy said there was no way the kid had been dead for any more than a few days, even though he&amp;rsquo;d been missing for almost three months. The kid was curled around something, and when my buddy brushed off the snow to see what it was, he said he almost couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe what he was seeing. It was a big chunk of ice that had been carved crudely to look sort of like a person. The kid was holding it so tight that it had frostbitten his chest and hands, which my buddy could tell even with the decay that had taken place. He radioed the rest of the crew, and they took the body off the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, he recapped all of this for me, and to put it simply, there was no way this kid could have both survived for almost three months on his own, or have gotten to this peak. There was no physical way this child could have walked almost fifty miles and ended up on the top of a goddamn mountain. To top it off, there was nothing in the kid&amp;rsquo;s stomach or colon. Nothing, not even water. It was like, my buddy said, the kid had been taken off the face of the earth, put in suspended animation, and dropped on this mountain months later, only to die of exposure. He’s never really gotten over that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last story I&amp;rsquo;ll share from him was one that took place relatively recently, only a few months ago. They were out doing a recon for mountain lions, because there had been several reports of sightings in the last couple of days. One of our jobs is to scout out the areas where these animals are seen to ensure that if they are in the area, we can warn people and close off those trails. He was out on his own in a very heavily forested part of the park toward dusk when he heard what sounded like a woman screaming in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as most of you know, when a mountain lion screams, it sounds almost exactly like a woman being brutally murdered. It’s unsettling, but far from abnormal. My buddy radioed back and let ops know that he&amp;rsquo;d heard one, and that he was going to keep going to see if he could figure out where its territory started. He heard the mountain lion scream a couple more times, always from the same spot, and determined the approximate area of the mountain lion’s territory. He was about to head back when he heard another scream, this time within only a few yards of him. Of course, he freaks out and starts heading back at a much faster pace, because the last thing he wants is to run into a god damn mountain lion and get mauled to death. As he got back on the path and started heading back, the screaming followed him, and he broke into a jog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was about a mile from ops, the screaming stopped, and he turned around to see if it was following him. It was almost night by this point, but he said that in the distance, just before the path rounded a corner, he could see what looked like a male figure. He called out to them, warning them that the paths were closed and that he needed to come back to the welcome center. The figure just stood there, and my buddy started to walk over. When he was about ten yards away, the figure took, as he described, &amp;lsquo;an impossibly long step&amp;rsquo; toward him and let out the same scream my buddy had been hearing. My buddy didn&amp;rsquo;t even say anything; he just turned and sprinted back to ops, never looking behind him. By the time he got back, the screaming had moved back into the woods. He didn&amp;rsquo;t mention it to anyone else, just said that there was a mountain lion in the area and that they would need to close those paths until the animal could be located and moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to end this entry here, since it&amp;rsquo;s turned into a huge wall of text. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be heading out on a yearly training op tomorrow morning, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be gone until early next week. I&amp;rsquo;ll be meeting with a lot of former trainers and buddies who work in other areas of the park, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be asking around about any stories they&amp;rsquo;d like to share. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you guys have been interested in my stories, and once I&amp;rsquo;m back from this op, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to share them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong, Marcus?&amp;quot; Victoria asked. You look absolutely pale, are you frightened?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light from the cellphone I had dropped reflected back into my face. Even with its light in my eyes, I could still make out the horrid figure looming before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“D-did you say… your &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt;?” I stammered. “You worship that thing?” I asked, still unable to peel my eyes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a few steps back, losing my balance in the process. Instantly, I fell back, slamming into the seating hues behind me. A sharp pain erupted from my back as I could feel the rush of air painfully forced its way out of my mouth. I guess it was true that the wind could literally be knocked out of you. I remained still, feeling the pain surge from my back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marcus, are you alright?!” Victoria asked, rushing to my side. “Are you hurt?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instantly, there was a loud slam from a door behind us flooding the room with bright light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What in the hell is goin&amp;rsquo; on in here?!” an angry voice yelled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victoria popped up. “Nothing, we were doing a little touring when Marcus had a tumble,” she said, addressing the voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marcus?” the voice responded in surprise. “Ya&amp;rsquo; brought an outsider into our area of worship?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear the voice’s footsteps moving at high pace until they halted next to me. My eyes hadn’t completely adjusted to the light yet so all I could see was a partially lit figure, a man at least. It didn’t matter who it was though, they sounded angry regardless. This could be the moment I was going to be sent home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He fell. I’m not sure if he’s injured himself or not,” Victoria continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man sighed. “He does look pretty banged up. Hey, can ya&amp;rsquo; at least move?” he asked, looking down at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t tried yet, but I attempted to move my arms and then my legs. Despite the lingering pain from my back, nothing appeared to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I’ll be alright,” I replied weakly. I slowly began to stand, feeling the man help me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you sure you’re alright, Marcus?” Victoria asked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’ll be alright,” the man said, helping me towards the light of the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my eyes eventually adjusted, I could finally make out his face; it was Terrance. After reaching the exit, he shut the door to the room behind us. It felt good to be out of there and back in the coolness of the lobby. Apparently, I had been sweating because I could see the large spots across my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, look here. I know yer&amp;rsquo; our guest and all, but I’m gonna need ya&amp;rsquo; to end yer little &lt;em&gt;explorin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; ,” he said to me before turning his attention over to Victoria. “As for &lt;em&gt;ya&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; , ya&amp;rsquo; outta know better. Matter fact, ya&amp;rsquo; should be restin&amp;rsquo;. We’re lucky that didn’t happen to &lt;em&gt;ya&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; now with that baby. No more explorin&amp;rsquo;, else things like this happen,” he said sharply. It felt like we were both being scolded as if we were his children. “Just remember yer&amp;rsquo; here for a job,” he said, returning to me. “So if ya&amp;rsquo; just stick to &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, ya&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Now ya&amp;rsquo; best go and wash up, dinner we’ll be ready soon. Bathroom is at the end of the hall on the left. Just make sure ya&amp;rsquo; knock before ya&amp;rsquo; enter. Go on now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded weakly, catching Victoria’s apologetic eyes as I turned to leave. I wasn’t mad at her for what had happened. How could I be? It was my own fault for clumsily falling like I did. I made my way back upstairs and cleaned up. By the time I finished, the time was 6:03 PM. I knew Terrance had told me not to be late, but I didn’t want to be the first one to show up either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had cut it too close though and hastily made my way back down, heading through the door on the left in the lobby. Coursing through the hallway, I caught the hint of food in the air. The smell gradually increased the closer I drew to the other side. By the time I had reached the end, my stomach was beginning to growl in protest, even my mouth began to water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached a pair of double-doors and could see light coming out through its cracks. Behind them, I could make out murmuring of voices. This was it, I thought. I took a deep breath and pushed open the doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dining room on the other side was big, like fancy big. The vibe I felt reminded me of the formality back in the old days, early 1900s maybe. Several antique cabinets stood up against the walls. They had glass doors with the insides filled with priceless looking treasures. Portraits ran along the walls portraying the faces of people, possibly ancestors of the sort, their eyes firmly staring forward as if a silent audience to the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the center of the room, a large table sat filled bountifully of plates with mountains of food and drinks. The other residents of this church could be seen standing around the table chatting amongst themselves. However, their chatting ceased when the doors shut behind me. They all gazed at me silently. My nerves were through the roof so I just stood there like a deer caught in the headlights. What now? I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one of the women spoke out to me: “Ah, you must be Marcus. Welcome, my dear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a British accent like Victoria’s and I quickly assumed this had to be her aunt. She was most likely in her mid-forties with a face lightly stained in wrinkles. She had dark hair tied neatly in a bun and wore a dress similar to Victoria’s, but with more red in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m Margret. Pleased to meet you,” she said, walking up to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After shaking my hand, she guided me over to the others around the table. There were four others: one was a woman she introduced to be Sophia, apparently the cousin, Victoria had mentioned. I was surprised to hear she didn&amp;rsquo;t exhibit the same accent as either of the two, instead having the same country one as the Reverend. She was much younger than Margret and probably a few years older than me. The next person was Terrance, who I had already met. From him was another man about the same age as him named Jessie. Lastly, she showed me Victoria. I couldn’t hold back my smile when I saw her; she returned one as well. Margret caught sight of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I take it you&amp;rsquo;ve already met my niece,” she stated with teasing smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well…” I started, beginning to blush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” Victoria spoke. “I was showing Marcus around earlier, trying to get him familiar with everything for when he starts his work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh I see,” Margret replied. “Well come now, dear. You sit over here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She led me to an empty chair near the end of the table next to her. Everyone else made their way behind their respective chairs too. Victoria stood behind the chair across from my own. I was ready to pull out the chair and sit when I caught sight of her eyes beckoning not to do so. I quickly corrected myself realizing that everyone was still standing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the Reverend arrives, we can begin eating soon,” Margaret said. “Please excuse him, he can run a little late sometimes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chuckled a little to myself thinking on Terrance’s words from before. However, it wasn’t long until everyone’s attention turned to the door opposite the end of the table. I hadn’t realized it was there. I was curious to where it led, possibly to the Reverend’s quarters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door opened and the Reverend came walking through. He still had his hobbled walk from earlier, his face still pressed with the same toothy grin. When he came through, everyone spoke in unison: “Evening, Reverend!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His smile grew wider at which he replied, “Evenin&amp;rsquo;, everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pulled out his chair and sat down, gesturing everyone to join him. We all followed suit. The food before us was truly a sight. There was many dishes flooded gracefully with food: rice dishes, freshly looking vegetables like corn and baked potatoes, sliced breads and even three roasted meats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large silver plate sat before everyone along with rows of forks and knives around it. I noticed the many wine bottles spaced along the table. The food looked simply amazing, and I couldn’t wait to eat, but was hesitant to make a move unsure of their manner of etiquette. I decided to follow any and all actions of Victoria. It was probably the reason why she sat across from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let us bow our heads for prayer,” the Reverend announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes shifted over to Victoria. She bowed her head with one eye open, pressing a finger to her lips while looking at me. Then she placed her hands together. I nodded and did so too. From then, the air was silent. I wasn’t sure how much time had elapsed, but it felt long, at least five minutes. I opened one eye to check to see if everyone was still praying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone including the Reverend still had their eyes shut. I could see all of them mouthing something silently to themselves. Margaret I could see was holding tightly to a charm from her necklace up to her forehead. I could only make out partial amounts of it, but I was sure it was the same emblem as the Congregation room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that everyone had a similar ring like Victoria all on their ring finger. The rings each withheld the same emblem engraved within it. This made sense since apparently they were keys to the room itself. I noticed Terrance didn’t have a ring on his finger; instead, I saw it hanging from a necklace. When I looked at the Reverend I saw that he had two rings: one was the same as the others, but the second one was different. I could tell the symbol wasn’t the same, but the way his hands were positioned made it so I couldn’t distinctly make it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amen,” the Reverend finally spoke out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On command, everyone’s eyes opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s us eat now,” he said, raising his hands out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone began grabbing at a bowl or a plate, passing it around, filling their plate at their leisure. I was glad it was finally time to eat. I don’t think my stomach could have taken another minute. I could feel my mouth watering even more, but I sat patiently, occasionally glancing over to Victoria for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So Marcus,&amp;quot; the Reverend spoke out, &amp;ldquo;Terrance told me ya&amp;rsquo; had quite a tumble today?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing his voice gave me a little jolt, snapping me out of whatever hunger trance I was in. “Uh. Yes, sir,” I managed to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh dear, are you alright?&amp;rdquo; Margaret asked. &amp;ldquo;You didn’t hurt yourself too bad, did you now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, I’m fine,&amp;quot; I answered. &amp;ldquo;A little sore, but I’ll be alright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s good to hear,&amp;rdquo; Sophia added. &amp;ldquo;Where was this? Wouldn’t want anyone else to do the same now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swallowed a little, not wanting to explain I had been somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be. Somehow, my eyes guided over to where Terrance sat. The glare from them felt unsettling as if his look alone was punishing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was in the Congregation room,” he said sternly without removing his gaze upon me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Say what now?” Jessie replied, joining in. “How did he manage to get in there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was helped &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; Victoria,” Terrance answered without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way he said it though, it felt like he was dying to get it off his chest. It was like he was reporting a crime or something, expecting a reward. My eyes fell to my plate unable to meet anyone else’s. I was unsure what would happen next at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh dear,” Margaret said softly. “Did you not have a candle on you, Hun?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly looked up, surprised at her response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Victoria,&amp;rdquo; she continued, &amp;ldquo;you took him in there with no proper lighting? It’s no wonder he banged himself up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t believe it. Here I thought I was going to hear a mouthful about invading their sanctuary and instead they brushed it off like it was nothing. I glanced over at Terrance, who appeared to be just as surprised by this reaction. Instead, he grumpily turned his attention to his plate unable to look at me in defeat. I looked over at the Reverend and he too seemed unfazed still smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, I wasn’t thinking when I did,” Victoria answered. “However, we were doing fine without a candle. It was more from the statue that startled Marcus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret and others laughed at this. “Oh, I was dreadfully frightened too when I first saw that thing as a child,” she replied. “It is quite a sight at first, Marcus, but I assure when you learn about Lanius&amp;hellip; you grow to &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; understand him and what he is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swallowed a little more at this. “And &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is he?” I asked, leaning in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now Margaret,&amp;rdquo; the Reverend interrupted, chuckling a bit. &amp;ldquo;We didn’t bring the young man all the way up here to teach him a sermon. Give the young man a chance to eat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, of course,” Margaret replied with a giggle. “Eat up, Marcus, we don’t waste anything around here,” she said, passing a bowl of potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt my stomach growl again at the sight of them. I couldn’t believe I had forgotten about my hunger. I thanked her and added it to my plate. I glanced over at Victoria, who gave me a slight nod of approval. I smiled and began receiving the other dishes being passed around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the meal went by smoothly. There was chatter amongst everyone; I listened as they went on about their everyday occurrences. It was funny to hear them bicker at each other a few times too. Occasionally, one of them would ask me a question or two about where I was from or what I did. By then though, I didn’t feel nervous anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, the Reverend dismissed everyone. On the way to my room, Victoria caught up with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marcus?” she called out. “I just wanted to apologize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For what?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For how Terrance acted in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chuckled. “It’s fine. I was just happy everyone else didn’t feel the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes well, Terrance has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been that way. I’m just sorry he tried to call you out like that,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m fine,” I said, blushing a little, trying to brush it off. “He did the same to you too,” I joked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed back upstairs, stopping when we arrived at my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well good night, Marcus. Today was truly a pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good night,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched her continue down the hallway, stopping a door on the left three away. She glanced my way when she saw that I was staring. Immediately, I snapped my head towards my door, unlocking it, and closing it behind me. Inside, I smiled to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly got dressed down into some shorts and a tee and sat on my bed. I decided to look for any new messages on my phone. The screen lit up revealing a surprising “no signal” message. Of course, I thought sarcastically, how I could forget? This place was a damn dead zone. I fell back, lying completely on the bed. Before I knew it, I was out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I awoke suddenly, blinded by light. Apparently, I had forgotten to turn off the lamp on the desk. The last thing I needed was them to complain about wasting their electricity. I slumped over to my feet to turn it off. After doing so, I caught sight of something outside. Below, I could make out my car in the moonlight. I could see that a clump of leaves had been blown over a lot of its roof. However, that’s not what caught my attention. I could see a figure standing next to my car. Even with the moonlight, I still could not make out who it was. It did appear as if the figure was trying to enter into my car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to focus my eyes better, but it still didn’t help. I wanted to blame it on my tiredness but my mind instantly thought about Terrance. Perhaps that jerk was still sore about dinner. He could’ve been trying to sabotage my car or something. I ran for my door, ripping it open and racing down the hall to the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reached the lobby, I stopped. The entire lobby was dark. In the air, I could smell a hint of something burning like candles. I noticed a thin line of light coming from the Congregation room’s double-doors. Completely forgetting about my car, I made my way to the doors. I could hear the slight murmur of voices from inside the closer I got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pressed my ear up against the door to get a better listen, but I still couldn’t make out what the voices were saying. I could hear one voice speak out-loud. When it did, the other voices would speak in unison in the same rhythm. It was clear that they were repeating the message of the lead one. The tone and manner they spoke sent a chill down my spine. It was clear this was the church conducting their worship upon whatever that horrid image was I had seen earlier. I didn’t understand how they could worship such a thing, but then I didn’t know how &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; religion could worship anything as they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to let them be and made my way back upstairs. They didn’t seem like bad people so how could I judge them based on what their belief; Victoria was a prime example of someone good from it. When I entered my room, I glanced out the window one last time expecting to still see something below. However, nothing was there. I shrugged it off; it was possible that there never was. I slipped back into my bed and fell asleep again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I was awoken by knocking at my door. I was surprised to find Terrance on the other side. He apparently was ready for me to begin my work as soon as possible. When I checked my phone, the time read: 6:30 AM. This was a real dick move by him. I didn’t even wake up this early for my job back at home. Reluctantly, I bit my tongue and told him I would be ready in ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting ready, he led me to the room where he had placed all of my equipment. The room had several old computers inside, like late 90s old. I hoped they didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the best performance on these dinosaurs. Nonetheless, I had a job to do. I immediately began setting up my equipment. I was even lucky to have company the whole time, Terrance saw to that. Seriously, what was this guy&amp;rsquo;s problem? Eventually though, the time went by and even &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; got bored and left me. I was too happy when this happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day went by fairly quick once I really got into my work. Of course, when the meal times came around I attended them. A few times out the day, Victoria came by to check on me. She would force me to take a break by walking around with her, which I didn’t mind at all. Days continued to pass as I worked, each one becoming more routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout these days, I found myself spending more time with Victoria. I always looked forward to those break times I had with her. We would walk around just talking and laughing, most of the time we did so outside. I never thought I would meet someone like her in a place like this. It made each day more doable. It was almost like our friendship was becoming more. I didn’t mind if it didn’t, but if it did, that was even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was something that bothered me though. Every time we were together, it felt as if someone or &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; was watching us. I couldn’t shake the feeling, even when I looked around, only to find nothing. I wanted to think nothing of it until one particular evening. After dinner, I came back to my room to find that someone had gone through my stuff. I hadn’t transported any of my clothes from my bags to the dresser, feeling too lazy to do so. One of my bags had a Velcro strap to accompany the zipper for reinforcement. I knew I always kept the Velcro fastened, I was rather OCD about it. However, the Velcro was clearly unfastened and hanging loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thought that ran through my mind was Terrance’s doing, but I had no proof. It was possible that I was just looking for someone to blame. I never did confirm who it was by my car, if there really was someone. So I couldn’t prove if that had been Terrance at all. I decided to look through the bag to be sure nothing was missing. I went through to find that everything appeared be there. I could tell my things were moved around a bit, but other than that, nothing. Clearly whatever the culprit was looking for, they didn’t find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t lie. I was angry that someone had gone through my things. Was it really Terrance’s doing? Did he really have something against that much that he do all of this? Maybe I should confront him, I thought. No, the last thing I wanted to do was start accusing people, which never looked good. I decided to let it slide, just this once. I got into shorts and collapsed onto the bed. When I did so, I felt my head his something hard. I felt around the pillow and instead of the usual fluffiness I felt a hard texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone had stuffed something. I reached inside and pulled out the object. It was a thick, old leathery book. I brought it over to the lamp on the desk to see it better. The cover looked hand-stitched to the spine. In the light, I could see a symbol engraved across in gold. It was the same one I had been seeing everywhere. My hands began to tremble at the sight of this. How did the book get there? Who put it there and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hesitant, but I slowly opened it; it gave off a peculiar scent, smelling of wet leaves and old tree bark. The pages were old and rather fragile. They were filled with text written in black ink. I couldn’t comprehend the words. They were written in some strange language. It didn’t even look like a language that should’ve existed. I continued to turn the pages though, seeing the text flood each one. A few pages in, I came across a picture. It was hand drawn with limited details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture depicted what looked to be a star. Around the star stood several figures looking like people, one appearing slightly bigger than the others. I turned the page to find more text. I continued turning until finally, I came across another picture. This one showed one of the human-like figures standing on what looked like a pedestal. The other human-like beings stood around the main one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I flipped until I came across the next picture. This picture showed the star from before. It looked bigger but with squiggly marks shooting away from it. The human-like beings appeared to be cowering in fear kneeling down at the star, even the big one from before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture after, depicted the human-like beings falling from the sky, their faces drawn in fear. The one I turned to after, showed them drawn in a dark place, their faces twisted in despair. It then showed the human-like figures begin to change into hideous deformed-like creatures. They had teeth and horns protruding out different parts of their bodies. The biggest one, looked even worse than the rest with eyes drawn angrily with sparks coming from its fang-filled mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite appearing like the drawing of eighth grader, the images were really disturbing. Something about them made the hairs on my neck rise. I wanted to stop, but my hands kept turning the pages despite my mind&amp;rsquo;s wishes. The next one showed one of the hideous beings stray from the others, it was smaller compared to them. The creature came across a man in the next one. It appeared to reveal a swirl-looking symbol to the man. The man appeared to walk through the swirl. When he did, the creature followed. A small child stood in front of the man in the next one; it was weird, but the two looked similar somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature appeared to possess the child’s body, when it did, the man fell to the ground, presumably dead. Now in the child’s body, the child grew up. As it did, it showed the creature leave the man’s body, depicting it underground, possibly sleeping. The man was seen surrounded by many people with others joining. Eventually like before, it showed the creature awaken next to the man showing him another swirl. Again, the man walked through the swirl with the creature following, appearing in front of a child. Once again, it possessed the child and the man died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images repeated. Each time as they did, I noticed the creature’s size growing bigger. Finally, I skipped further into the book to see where they led. The images revealed something different this time. Now, it showed the man with a woman, the creature standing behind her. When I flipped where the next image would appear, I found its page stuck tightly together to another. I tried to part them, but a tear began to form threatening to ruin both pages altogether. I decided to skip it and move on to the next image. My heart dropped, when I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the image showed the woman pregnant among the group of people from before. The images later went to show the woman in labor giving birth. The man appeared to have delivered the baby. However, it looked like no ordinary child. It was depicted to have large black eyes with long teeth. Horns poked out in many directions of the child with its legs and arms disproportionate to each other. The man was holding the child in the air, almost like he was glorifying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take anymore and slammed the book shut. I tossed it to the other side of the room. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, my arms and face sweaty. I shook my head in disbelief. There was no way, I thought. What the hell was all of that even about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing those images, I couldn’t sleep for most of the night. All I could see was the horrid inked images of that creature. When I thought of that woman depicted to being pregnant, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of Victoria. There was no way it could have been her, could it? A lot of women can be pregnant. It was just a coincidence, it had to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I worked sluggishly from the lack of sleep. At breakfast, I made no eye-contact with Victoria nor did I talk to anyone else. If they asked, I simply blamed it on a headache or tiredness. While working, I pleaded to myself, hoping Victoria would not come by as she usually did. Yet despite my internal pleads, she came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marcus, are you feeling any better?” she asked, entering the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t respond; I didn’t even look up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marcus?” she said. “Are you alright?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My silence caused her to press on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong? Why are you ignoring me?” she asked, I could hear a hint of annoyance in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still I gave her no answer. What could I say? All I could think about was…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fine!” she yelled, and proceeded to leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That child?” I asked her without looking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear footsteps come to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” she asked, confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who’s the father of your child?” I rephrased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wh- Is that what this is all about?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood up finally facing her. It was direct, but I had to know. My face along with my silence must’ve said it all for her. I could see the look of confusion in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why does it &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt;?” she asked, harshly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I need to know,” I stated firmly. I wanted it to be from her boyfriend or even her deadbeat husband, any of these were better than what I was thinking. Yet, the entire time I had been here, I not seen him nor had there been any mention of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She just stared at me, with her mouth open as if trying to find the words to speak. Tears formed in her eyes. They were gazing at me angrily and with sadness simultaneously. She shook her head softly never taking her eyes from mine. Finally, she spoke, “You stay away from me, Marcus. Never come near me or speak to me again or I will have you sent home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stormed out leaving me dumbfounded. My plan had back-fired. I wanted to call out to her, to stop her and apologize, but again I was at a loss for words. Like an idiot, I just stood there and let my head fall down in grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the day continued on, Victoria never returned to see me while I worked. At mealtime, she never made eye-contact with me either, keeping her eyes focused on her plate. I felt horrible for what I did. I had no right to put her on the spot like that. I cursed at myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, I attempted to talk her as she was leaving for her room. She ignored me though when I did. I don’t know why I thought knocking on her door would be any better. All I received upon it opening was having it immediately slammed in my face. I sighed, truly feeling utter regret and made my way back to my room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did, I sat on my bed, staring off into space. I wished I had never found that damn book, then everything between her and I would have been normal. I missed seeing her already: her smile, hearing her laugh, just being around her. I let my hand slide to my pillow to check for the book only to find it missing. Stunned, I poured out the pillow’s contents finding only feathers and cotton. I was sure I had put it back after I left each time. Was somebody messing with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I angrily began searching for the book: I checked my suitcases, tossing clothes around as I did. I checked the dressers, under the bed and even behind the desk. Where was it? My eyes met the window when I came from under the desk. When I looked down, I saw the same figure from all those days before, standing next to my car. This time it appeared be looking up at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger filled me. I assumed it was Terrance again. This was a bad time for him to be messing with me. I raced out of my room and downstairs. I ran around to the side of the building to where my car was. The moonlight was stronger than ever, illuminating my way as I did. When I reached my car, no one was in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had finally reached my boiling point. “You picked the wrong day to fuck with me!” I yelled out. “Come on out, now! If not, leave me the hell alone!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My voice echoed into the air, before dying in the wind. The building gave off one of its unsettling moans. The leaves from the trees in the distance shook, rattling against their branches in the wind. There was no one out here. Feeling my mind grow at ease and realizing how much of a fool I looked, I started to make my way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my nerves froze when I heard the snapping of a twig behind me. My heart began beating fast. I slowly turned around to see a figure gradually rising from behind my car. The figure was wearing a cloak with a hood over its head. In the light, I could see pieces of twigs and leaves sticking out of its cloak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth to scream, but the figure quickly darted over to me, covering my mouth with its hand. It shushed me softly. The voice was clearly of a woman’s. She slowly removed her hand from my mouth and made her way to the back of the building. Before disappearing behind it, she gestured me to follow her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to, but my legs began to move on their own in her direction. When I reached the other side, I saw her remove the hood from her head. The moonlight lit her face. She was an elderly looking woman possibly in her early fifties. She had ragged black hair mixed with gray strands that ran untamed. Her face was pressed with wrinkles with dry patches of dirt. The scent from her was rank, but familiar; it smelled like wet leaves and old tree bark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did you see it?” she whispered, her voice was crackly and rasp. “You saw it in the book, right? You have to help me. You have to help me save my daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;../footsteps&#34;&gt;Footsteps&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;../balloons&#34;&gt;Balloons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, please do so before reading what&amp;rsquo;s below so you&amp;rsquo;ll understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have read my other stories and asked if there was more and received cryptic answers from me, I want to apologize for being dishonest. I said several times in the comments that nothing really happened after &amp;ldquo;Footsteps&amp;rdquo;, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t true. The events of the following story weren&amp;rsquo;t locked away in the recesses of my mind; I&amp;rsquo;ve always remembered them. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I remembered &amp;ldquo;Balloons&amp;rdquo; and spoke with my mother about the following events that I realized how intertwined this story was with everything else, but I originally hadn&amp;rsquo;t really planned on sharing this anyway. My desire to withhold this memory was due mostly to the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I showed good judgment in it; I also wanted consent from another person to tell it, so as to not misrepresent what transpired. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect there to be a lot of interest in my other stories, so I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d really get pressed for more details, and I would have been happy to keep this to myself for the rest of my life. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to reach the other party, but I would feel disingenuous withholding this story from those who wanted more information now that I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken with my mother and another connecting line has been drawn. What follows is as accurate a recollection as I could manage. I apologize for the length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the summer before my first year of elementary school learning how to climb trees. There was one particular pine tree right outside my house that seemed almost designed for me. It had branches that were so low I could easily grab them without a boost, and for the first couple days after I first learned how to pull myself up I would just sit on the lowest branch, dangling my feet. The tree was outside our back fence and was easily visible from the kitchen window which was just above the sink. Before too long my mother and I developed a routine where I would go play on the tree when she washed the dishes because she could easily see me while she did other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the summer passed, my abilities grew and before too long I was climbing fairly high. As the tree got taller, its branches not only got thinner but more widely-spaced. I eventually reached a point where I couldn&amp;rsquo;t actually climb any higher, and so the game had to change; I began to concentrate on speed, and in the end I could reach my highest branch in twenty-five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got too confident and one afternoon I tried to step from a branch before I had firmly grasped the next one. I fell about twenty feet and broke my arm really badly in two places. My mom was running toward me yelling and I remember her sounding like she was underwater&amp;mdash;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what she said but I do remember being surprised by just how white my bone was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to start Kindergarten with a cast and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have any friends to sign it. My mom must have felt terrible because the day before I started school she brought home a kitten. He was just a baby and was striped with tan and white. As soon as she put him down he crawled into an empty case of soda that was sitting on the floor. I named him Boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxes was only an outside cat when he escaped. My mom had him declawed so he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t destroy the furniture, so as a result we did our best to keep him inside. He&amp;rsquo;d get out every now and then, and we&amp;rsquo;d find him somewhere in the backyard chasing some kind of bug or lizard, though he could hardly ever catch one because he had no front claws. He was pretty evasive, but we&amp;rsquo;d always catch him and carry him back inside. He&amp;rsquo;d scramble to look back over my shoulder&amp;mdash;I told my mom that it was because he was planning his strategy for next time. Once inside we&amp;rsquo;d give him some tuna fish, and he came to learn what the sound of the can-opener might signal; he&amp;rsquo;d come running whenever he heard it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conditioning came in handy later because toward the end of our time in that house Boxes would get out much more often and would run under the house into the crawlspace where neither of us wanted to follow because it was cramped and probably crawling with bugs and rodents. Ingeniously, my mom thought to hook the can-opener to an extension cord out back and run it right outside the hole that Boxes had gone through. Eventually he would emerge with his loud meows, looking excited by the sound and then horrified at how we could run such a cruel ruse on him&amp;mdash;a can-opener with no tuna made no sense to Boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time he escaped to under the house was actually our last day in it. My mom had put the house on the market and we had begun packing our things. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have much, and we stretched the packing out a while, though I had already packed up all my clothes at my mom&amp;rsquo;s request&amp;mdash;my mom could tell I was really sad about moving and wanted the transition to be smooth for me, and I guess she thought that having my clothes in the box would reinforce the idea that we were moving but things wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change that much. When Boxes got out as we were loading some things into the moving van my mom cursed because she had already packed the can opener and wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where it was. I pretended to go look for it so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to go under the house, and my mom (probably completely aware of my little scam) moved one of the panels and crawled in. She came out with Boxes pretty quickly and seemed pretty unnerved, which made me feel even better about getting out of it. My mom made some phone calls while I packed a little more, and then she came into my room and told me that she had spoken to the realtor and we were going to start moving into the other house that day. She said it like it was excellent news, but I had thought we had more time in the house&amp;mdash;she originally said that we weren&amp;rsquo;t moving until the end of the next week and it was only Tuesday. What&amp;rsquo;s more, we weren&amp;rsquo;t completely finished packing, but my mom said sometimes it was just easier to replace things than pack them and haul them all over the city. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to grab the rest of my boxed clothes. I asked if I could call Josh to say bye, but she said that we could just call him from our new house. We left in the moving van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to stay in touch with Josh for years, which is surprising since we no longer went to the same school. Our parents weren&amp;rsquo;t close friends, but they knew that we were and so they would accommodate our desire to see one another by driving us back and forth for sleep-overs&amp;mdash;sometimes every weekend. For Christmas one year our parents even pooled their money and got us some really nice walkie-talkies that were advertised to work across a range that extended past the distance between our houses; they also had batteries that could last for days if the walkie-talkie was on but not used. They would only occasionally work well enough that we could talk across the city, but when we stayed-over we&amp;rsquo;d use them around the house, talking in mock-radio speak that we had taken from movies, and they worked great for that. Thanks to our parents we were still friends when we were ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One weekend I was staying over at Josh&amp;rsquo;s and my mom called me to say goodnight; she was still pretty watchful even when she couldn&amp;rsquo;t actually watch me, but I had gotten so used to it that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice it, even if Josh did. She sounded upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxes was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This must have been a Saturday night, because I had spent the night at Josh&amp;rsquo;s the previous night and was going to go home the next day because we had school on Monday. Boxes had been missing since Friday afternoon; I gathered that she had not seen him since returning home after dropping me off. She must have decided to tell me he was missing because if he didn&amp;rsquo;t come home before I did then I would be devastated at, not only his absence, but how she could have kept it from me. She told me not to worry. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;ll come back. He always does!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Boxes didn&amp;rsquo;t come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weekends later I stayed at Josh&amp;rsquo;s again. I was still upset about Boxes, but my mom told me that there had been many times when pets had disappeared from home for weeks or even months, only to return on their own; she said they always knew where home was and would always try to get back. I was explaining this to Josh when a thought hit me so hard that I interrupted my own sentence to say it aloud. &amp;ldquo;What if Boxes thought of the wrong home?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh was confused. &amp;ldquo;What? He lives with you. He knows where his home is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But, he grew up somewhere else, Josh. He was raised in my old house a couple neighborhoods away. Maybe he still thinks of that place as home, like I do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ohhh I get it. Well that&amp;rsquo;d be great! We&amp;rsquo;ll tell my dad tomorrow and he&amp;rsquo;ll take us over there so we can look!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No he won&amp;rsquo;t, man. My mom said that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t ever go back to that place because the new owners wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wanna be bothered. She said that she told your mom and dad the same thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh persisted, &amp;ldquo;Ok then we&amp;rsquo;ll just go out exploring tomorrow and make our way to your old house&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No! If we get spotted your dad will find out and then so will my mom! We have to go there ourselves&amp;hellip; We have to go there tonight&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take that much convincing to get Josh on board since he was usually the one to come up with ideas like this. But we had never snuck out of his house before. It actually turned out to be incredibly easy. The window in his room opened to the backyard and he had a latched wooden fence that wasn&amp;rsquo;t locked. After those two minor hurtles we slipped off into the night, flashlight and walkie-talkies in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two ways to get from Josh&amp;rsquo;s house to my old house. We could walk on the street and make all the turns or go through the woods, which would take about half the time. It would have taken about two hours to walk there taking the street, but I suggested that we go that way anyway; I told him it was because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get lost. Josh refused and said that if we were seen they might recognize him and tell his dad. He threatened to go home if we didn&amp;rsquo;t just take the shortcut, and I accepted it because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the last time I walked through these woods at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woods were much less creepy with a friend and a flashlight, and we were making pretty good time. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely sure where we were, but Josh seemed confident enough and that bolstered my morale. We passed through a particularly thick patch of tangled trees when the strap on my walkie-talkie got caught on a branch. Josh had the flashlight and so I was struggling to get the walkie free when I heard Josh say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey man, wanna go for a swim?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked over to where he was shining the flashlight, though I closed my eyes as I did, because I now knew where we were. He was pointing at the pool float. This was where I had woken up in these woods all those years ago. I felt a lump in my throat and the sting of fresh tears in my eyes as I continued to struggle with the walkie. Frustrated, I yanked on it hard enough to break it free and I turned and walked to Josh who had partially laid down on the pool float in a mock-sunbathing pose. As I walked toward him I stumbled and nearly fell into a fairly large hole that was sitting in the middle of this small clearing, but I regained my balance and stopped right at its edge. It was deep. I was surprised by the size of the hole, but more surprised by the fact that I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember it. I realized it must not have been there that night because it was in the same spot where I had awoken. I put it out of my mind and turned to Josh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quit messing around man! You saw I was stuck over there, and you were just laying here joking around on this float!&amp;rdquo; I punctuated the sentence with a kick to an exposed part of the float. A screeching rose from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh&amp;rsquo;s smile inverted. He suddenly looked terrified and was struggling to get off the float, but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t in a quick manner due to the awkward way he had been laying on it. Each time he would fall back on the float the screeching would intensify. I wanted to help Josh but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t move myself any closer&amp;mdash;my legs wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cooperate; I hated these woods. I picked up the flashlight that he had thrown in his thrashing and shined in on the float not knowing what to expect. Finally, Josh got off the float and rushed next to me, looking at where I was shining the light. Suddenly there it was. It was a rat. I started laughing nervously and we both watched the rat run into the woods, taking the screeches with it. Josh lightly punched me in the arm, the smile slowly returning to his face, and we continued walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We quickened our pace and made it out of the woods faster than we thought we would, and we found ourselves back in my old neighborhood. The last time I had rounded the bend ahead I had seen my house fully illuminated, and all the memories of what transpired came flooding back. I felt a skipping in my heart as we were finally turning the corner and about to face the full view of my house, remembering last time how incandescent it was. But this time all the lights were off. From a distance I could see my old climbing tree and as my mind traced the steps of causality backward I realized that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be back here this night if that tree hadn&amp;rsquo;t grown, and I was briefly in awe of how all events were like that. As we got closer I could see that the lawn looked terrible; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even guess when it had last been mowed. One of the shutters had partially broken loose and was rocking back and forth in the breeze, and over all the house just looked dirty. I was sad to see my old home in such a state of disrepair. Why would my mom care if we bothered the new owners if they cared so little about where they lived? And then I realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no new owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house was abandoned, though it looked simply forsaken. Why would my mom lie to me about our house having new people in it? But, I thought that this was actually a good thing. It would be easier to look around for Boxes if we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about being spotted by the new family. This would make it much quicker. Josh interrupted my thoughts as we walked through the gate and up to the house itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your old house sucks, dude!&amp;rdquo; Josh yelled as quietly as he could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shut up, Josh! Even like this it&amp;rsquo;s still nicer than your house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey man&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;OK, OK. I think Boxes is probably under the house. One of us has to go under and look, but the other should stay next to the opening in case he comes running out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt;? There&amp;rsquo;s no way I&amp;rsquo;m going under there. It&amp;rsquo;s your cat, man. You do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look, I&amp;rsquo;ll game you for it, unless you&amp;rsquo;re too scared&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I said holding my fist over my up-turned palm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fine, but we go on &amp;lsquo;shoot&amp;rsquo;, not on three. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;rock, paper, scissors, SHOOT&amp;rsquo;, not &amp;lsquo;one, two, THREE&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know how to play the game, Josh. You&amp;rsquo;re the one who always messes up. And it&amp;rsquo;s two out of three.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wiggled loose the panel that my mom would always move when we she had to crawl under here for Boxes. She only had to do it a couple of times since the can-opener trick usually worked, but when she had to do it she hated it, especially that last time, and as I looked into the darkness of the crawlspace I had a greater appreciation for why. Before we moved she said that it was actually better that Boxes ran under here, despite how hard it could be to get him out. It was less dangerous than him jumping over the fence and running around the neighborhood. All that was true, but I was still dreading doing this. I grabbed the flashlight and the walkie and began to crawl in; a powerful smell overtook me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It smelled like death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned on my walkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josh, are you there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Macho Man, come back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josh, cut it out. There&amp;rsquo;s something wrong down here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you mean?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It stinks. It smells like something died.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it Boxes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I really hope not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set down the walkie and moved the flashlight around as I crawled forward. Looking through the hole from the outside you could see all the way back with the right lighting, but you had to be inside to see around the support blocks that held the house up. I&amp;rsquo;d say that there was about forty percent of the area that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t see unless you were actually in the crawlspace, but even inside I discovered that I could only see directly where the flashlight was pointing; I realized that this would make scouting around the place much more difficult. As I moved forward, the smell intensified. The fear was growing in me that Boxes had come here and something had happened to him. I shined the flashlight around but couldn&amp;rsquo;t see much of anything. I wrapped my fingers around a support block to pull myself forward and as I did that, I felt something that made my hand recoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart sank and I prepared myself emotionally for what I was about to see. I crawled slowly so I could prolong what I knew was coming and I inched my eyes and the flashlight past the block to see what was on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I staggered back in horror. &amp;ldquo;JESUS CHRIST!&amp;rdquo; escaped my trembling mouth. It was a hideous and twisted creature, badly decomposed. Its skin had rotted away on its face so the teeth appeared to be enormous. And the smell was unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is it? Are you ok? Is it Boxes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached for the walkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, no it&amp;rsquo;s not Boxes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well what the hell is it then?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shined the light on it again and looked at it with less fear in my vision. I chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a raccoon!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well keep looking. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go into the house to see if he might&amp;rsquo;ve made it in there somehow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What? No. Josh, don&amp;rsquo;t go in there. What if Boxes is down here and runs out?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He can&amp;rsquo;t. I put the board back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked and saw that he was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why&amp;rsquo;d you do that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry man, you can move it easy. This makes more sense. If Boxes ran out and I missed him then he&amp;rsquo;d be gone. If he&amp;rsquo;s down there then grab him tight and I&amp;rsquo;ll come move the board, and if he&amp;rsquo;s not then you can move it yourself while I look in the house!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of his points were good, and I doubted he&amp;rsquo;d be able to get in anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OK. But be careful and don&amp;rsquo;t touch anything. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of my old clothes still in boxes in my room, you can look in there to see if he crawled in one. And make sure to bring your walkie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roger that, good buddy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that it would be pitch-black in there; the power would have been turned off since no one was paying the bill. With any luck he&amp;rsquo;d be able to see from the streetlights that might cast some light inside&amp;mdash;otherwise I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what he&amp;rsquo;d do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before too long I heard footsteps right over my head and felt old dirt raining down on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josh is that you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chhkkkk breaker, breaker. This is Macho Man coming back for the big Tango Foxtrot. The Eagle has landed. What&amp;rsquo;s your 20, Princess Jasmine? Over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Asshole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macho Man, my 20 is in your bathroom lookin&amp;rsquo; at your stash of magazines. Looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve got a thing for dudes&amp;rsquo; butts. What&amp;rsquo;s the report on that? Over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear him laughing without the walkie and I started laughing too. I head the footsteps fade away a little&amp;mdash;he was on his way to my room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man, it&amp;rsquo;s dark in here. Hey, are you sure you had boxes of clothes in here? I don&amp;rsquo;t see any.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah, there should be a couple boxes in front of the closet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;rsquo;t any boxes in here, lemme check to see if you maybe put the boxes in the closet before you left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thinking that maybe my mom had come back and gotten the clothes and just given them away because I had outgrown a lot of them, but I remembered leaving the boxes there&amp;mdash;I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have time to close the last one up before we left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was waiting for Josh to tell me what he found, I kicked out my leg which had started falling asleep because of the position I was in and it hit something. I looked back and saw something really strange. It was a blanket and all around it there were bowls. I crawled a little closer to it. The blanket smelled moldy and most of the bowls were empty but one had something that I recognized still in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a different kind than we gave to Boxes, but I suddenly understood. My mom had set up a little place for Boxes to encourage him to come here instead of running around the neighborhood. That made a lot of sense, and it seemed even more likely that Boxes would have come back to this place. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s so cool, mom,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found your clothes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh cool. Where were the boxes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like I said, there are no boxes. Your clothes are in your closet&amp;hellip; They&amp;rsquo;re hanging up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a chill. This was impossible. I had packed all my clothes. Even though we weren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to move for another two weeks when we left, I remember packing them and thinking that it was stupid for me to have to get clothes out of the box and put them back in. I had packed them, but someone had hung them back up. Why though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh needed to get out of there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That can&amp;rsquo;t be right, Josh. They&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be in boxes. Stop messing around, and just come back outside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No joke man. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at them. Maybe you just thought that you left them. Haha! Wow! You sure like to look at yourself, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What? What do you mean?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your walls, man. Haha. Your walls are covered in Polaroids of yourself! There are hundreds of them! What&amp;rsquo;d you hire someone to&amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked my walkie to see if I had switched it off somehow. It was fine. I could hear footsteps but couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell exactly where Josh was going. I waited for Josh to finish his sentence, thinking that his finger had just slipped off the button, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t continue. He seemed to be stomping around the house now. I was just about to radio him when he came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s someone in the house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His voice was hushed and broken&amp;mdash;I could hear he was on the verge of tears. I wanted to respond, but how loud was his walkie turned up? What if the other person heard it? I said nothing and just waited and listened. What I heard were footsteps. Heavy, dragging footsteps. And then a loud thud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh God&amp;hellip; Josh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been found; I was sure of it. This person had found him and was hurting him. I broke out in tears. He was my only friend, next to Boxes. And then I realized: What if Josh told him I was under here? What could I possibly do? As I struggled to compose myself, I thankfully heard Josh&amp;rsquo;s voice through the walkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s got something, man. It&amp;rsquo;s a big bag. He just threw it on the floor. And&amp;hellip; oh God, man&amp;hellip; the bag&amp;hellip; I think it just moved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was paralyzed. I wanted to run home. I wanted to save Josh. I wanted to go for help. I wanted so many things but I just lay there, frozen. As I lay unable to move, my eyes focused on the corner of the house that was right under my room; I moved my flashlight. My breath hitched at what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals. Dozens of them. All of them dead. They lay in piles all around the perimeter of the crawlspace. Could Boxes be among these corpses? Was this what the cat food was for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this broke my shock as I knew I had to get out of there and I scrambled to the board. I pushed on it, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t budge. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t move it because it was wedged in there and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get my fingers around it since the edges were outside. I was trapped. &amp;ldquo;Goddamn you, Josh!&amp;rdquo; I whispered to myself. I could feel thunderous footsteps above me. The house was shaking. I heard Josh scream, and it was matched by another scream that wasn&amp;rsquo;t full of fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continued pushing I felt the board move, but I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t me who was moving it. I could hear footsteps above me and in front of me and shouting and screaming filling the brief silences between the footsteps. I moved back and held my walkie ready to try to defend myself, and the board was thrown to the side and an arm shot in and grabbed for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go, man! Now!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Josh. Thank God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scrambled out of the opening holding the flashlight and the walkie. When we got to the fence we both jumped it, but Josh&amp;rsquo;s walkie fell; he reached for it and I told him to forget it. We had to move. Behind us I could hear yelling, though they weren&amp;rsquo;t words, only sounds. And we, perhaps foolishly, ran for the woods to get back to Josh&amp;rsquo;s quicker and be somewhat harder to follow. The whole way through the woods Josh kept yelling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My picture! He took my picture!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I knew the man &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; had Josh&amp;rsquo;s picture&amp;mdash;from all those years ago at the ditch. I supposed Josh still thought those mechanical sounds were from a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made it back to Josh&amp;rsquo;s house and back into his room before his parents woke up. I asked him about the big bag and if it really moved and he said he couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sure. He kept apologizing about dropping the walkie at the house, but obviously that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal. We didn&amp;rsquo;t go to sleep and sat peering out the window waiting for him. I went home later that day as it was about 3 AM already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told my mom the basics of this story a couple days ago. She broke down and was furious about the danger I put myself in. I asked her why she made all those things up about bothering the new owners to stop me from going&amp;mdash;why did she think the house was so dangerous? She became irate and hysterical, but she answered my question. She grabbed my hand and squeezed it harder than I thought her capable of and locked her eyes to mine, whispering as if she was afraid of being overheard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because I never put any fucking blankets or bowls under the house for Boxes. You weren&amp;rsquo;t the only one to find them&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt dizzy. I understood so much now. I understood why she had looked so uneasy after she brought Boxes out from under the house on our last day there; she found more than spiders or a rat&amp;rsquo;s nest that day. I understood why we left almost two weeks early. I understood why she tried to stop me from going back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knew. She knew he made his home under ours, and she kept it from me. I left without saying another word and didn&amp;rsquo;t finish the story for her, but I want to finish it here, for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got home from Josh&amp;rsquo;s that day. I threw my stuff on the floor and it scattered everywhere; I didn&amp;rsquo;t care, I just wanted to sleep. I woke up around 9 PM to the sound of Boxes&amp;rsquo; meowing. My heart leapt. He had finally come home. I was a little sick about the fact that if I had just waited a day none of the previous night&amp;rsquo;s events would have happened and I&amp;rsquo;d have Boxes anyway, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t matter; he was back. I got off my bed and called for him looking around to catch a glint of light off his eyes. The crying continued and I followed it. It was coming from under the bed. I laughed a little thinking I had just crawled under a house looking for him and how this was so much better. His meows were being muffled by a shirt, so I flung it aside and smiled, yelling &amp;ldquo;welcome home, Boxes!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His cries were coming from my walkie-talkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxes never came home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this experience, I decided to stick my neck out a little more. This was getting serious, and I needed a clear picture of what I was up against. I had an acquaintance in the FBI who owed my family the favor of a lifetime. I convinced him over dinner that I paid for to look into the Lost Media Group for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, he had a document for me. It was an analyst report containing all the information the FBI had on this mysterious group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information known by the Bureau about the Lost Media Group is so scant as to strongly suggest that the group does not really exist. This report assumes the existence of the group for investigative purposes, however most of the information contained herein is more speculation than confirmed fact. Most of the testimony concerning the LMG has been hearsay and off-the record&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact nature, size, organization, origins, and goals of the LMG are mysterious. It is said to be a multinational organization that has embedded in multiple entertainment industries and is most active in cities with large concentrations of entertainment companies, such as Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Toronto, and Tokyo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership is by invitation only and is rumored to include a number of wealthy entertainment executives and financiers. Secondhand informants report that the group uses a variety of criminal tactics, including bribery, blackmail, and violence, to prevent the dissemination of information concerning them&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is speculated that the LMG uses other crime syndicates as proxies for their operations in order to obfuscate investigations into their activities, and that they mislead people into believing they are more powerful than they really are. Claims that the group possesses supernatural powers are likely the result of selective disinformation campaigns&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lost Media Group first came to the Bureau&amp;rsquo;s attention during the 1970s, but is said to date back to the early 1900s. During the 1920s and 1930s, an urban legend emerged concerning &amp;ldquo;mystery reels&amp;rdquo;, which were said to be altered versions of syndicated movie theater reels that differed significantly in content and tone from the standard copies. The Bureau believes that the lack of public awareness of entertainment industry standards and copyright contributed to the fact that such works were not reported to the media or law enforcement&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme in testimony concerning &amp;ldquo;mystery reels&amp;rdquo; is that they often contained violent content that was more extreme than mainstream theater content, and several former members of censorship boards have claimed to have received complaints about them. Witnesses also claimed that mystery reels based on live-action films featured different actors, and that these actors in retrospect seem to have been coerced. One witness claimed that an actor in a silent mystery reel appeared to be saying &amp;ldquo;help me&amp;rdquo; before being silenced by someone off-screen. These claims have led the Bureau to believe that the LMG may have participated in trafficking in human beings. The group is also rumored to have been involved in the production and distribution of &amp;ldquo;snuff films&amp;rdquo;, though there is as little evidence to support this claim as there is to support the very existence of snuff movies&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other crimes the Lost Media Group is suspected to be involved with include media piracy, drugging of actors, trafficking in endangered species (for use in films), and recording executions for other criminal organizations&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pondered over the report. Membership by invitation only&amp;hellip;well-funded, well-connected, must be well-organized. Yet their activities seemed nothing short of bizarre. Why would a group with the kind of resources this group apparently had—unlike the FBI, I was beginning to take the existence of the Lost Media Group for granted at this point—not spend them on more traditional and profitable criminal activities? Why would that many people commit so many resources and risk so much just to make movies? There was no way such a sophisticated syndicate could make enough money off of simple piracy to be considered profitable, and the other crimes listed in the report would seem beyond the scope of expertise of a cabal ostensibly comprised of people in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it not about money? An ideological or religious motivation, perhaps? Certainly it didn&amp;rsquo;t fit any religion I could think of. And it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like they were interested in influencing elections. Their motives must be subtler. They had a message they wanted to send, or an influence they wanted to create, using the power of mass media, and were willing to dabble in any number of crimes toward whatever their ultimate end was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last body I had in the living world didn&amp;rsquo;t cope too well with my mind driving it. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes hard to remember that the lessons you learn in Hell aren&amp;rsquo;t a good fit for the civilized world. When murder is just a normal part of existence, you tend to keep doing it out of habit. The inevitable result is either death or exorcism and a trip back to the city of Dis. Safe to say, I got a bit carried away the last time I was here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last taste of freedom, I knew that I had to get back out of Dis. My existence ever since I squandered my last host has been utterly dedicated to fighting my way back into a pillar of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to escape Dis. After what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, I had to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new body seems a little more durable than the last one. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m back, shall we take another trip into Hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;phlegethon-swamp&#34;&gt;Phlegethon Swamp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rains in Hell. It rains all the fucking time and that water has to go somewhere. Most of it drains out into Gehenna where it sinks into the otherworldly ash and apparently disappears. The rest flows either into the sewers beneath the city or it collects in Phlegethon Swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how it&amp;rsquo;s a bad idea to drink the rainwater in Hell without boiling it? Well Phlegethon&amp;rsquo;s water will kill you no matter what you do with it. Even letting the stuff touch your skin can be deadly. You see, the swamp isn&amp;rsquo;t just filled with disease and rot, it&amp;rsquo;s also brimming with chemical waste. One pool might simply be undrinkable but another might dissolve your flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re mad enough to travel to Phlegethon, or unlucky enough to be born there, your odds of survival are slim. Phlegethon&amp;rsquo;s waters are inky black and it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to tell just how deep a pool is by looking. It could be an inch or it could be a mile. You never know whether or not your next footfall will plunge you into the cloying abyss. Worse still, there are places where the sewers gradually drain the water and create unseen vortices capable of dragging down even the strongest of the damned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To navigate the swamp, you&amp;rsquo;re better off using the crumbled buildings as stepping stones. The corrosive water causes wooden supports to wither and collapse, so there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of debris lying around to stand on. Even so, if you don&amp;rsquo;t take it slow and keep your balance, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to slip and subject yourself to a fucking agonising death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least are the wildfires. These are the reason that even the most insane tribes don&amp;rsquo;t try to establish a permanent stronghold in Phlegethon Swamp. All that chemical waste and decaying matter makes the swamp extremely volatile. A lightning strike or build-up of gasses can result in immense explosions that ignite Phlegethon&amp;rsquo;s surface for miles around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildfires move fast. I guarantee you that you won&amp;rsquo;t outrun one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cocytus&#34;&gt;Cocytus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you see Cocytus, you could be forgiven for thinking you&amp;rsquo;d reached the very edge of Dis. The pit is dozens of miles wide and several times as deep. At some point in the dim and distant past, a fragile alliance of tribes put their slaves to work digging a quarry. Why they did this is lost to time but many believe it was an attempt to escape Dis. Perhaps those tribes hoped that if they dug far enough, they&amp;rsquo;d eventually tunnel their way out of Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, the more likely answer is that the tribes were looking for resources. If that&amp;rsquo;s true, then the excavation was a success. Miles below the surface, beneath the rock and dirt, there are caverns filled with veins of iron and copper. So far underground and sheltered from the relentless fucking rain, it&amp;rsquo;s far easier to create a fire hot enough to smelt ore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of such a position wasn&amp;rsquo;t lost on the tribes and that alliance soon showed just how brittle it was. After a short but savage burst of treachery, the initial settlers of Cocytus all but wiped themselves out. Since then, the pit has been settled and mined countless times. Coordinated efforts from various tribes have transformed the quarry into an abyss. So far, these alliances have always been broken sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocytus has many paths into its depths and the lower you go, the more labyrinthine the pit becomes. The sprawling caverns shelter entire shanty towns and crude smelting facilities. Some are abandoned, others have been lost to cave-ins, yet there are still plenty of tribes who fight, join forces and betray one another over the precious ore veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, you have to go pretty fucking deep to find an untapped vein and this is where Cocytus becomes truly deadly. Anybody who thought they might be able to tunnel out of Hell would be sorely disappointed once they learn what lies in the depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all these years, after digging for so many miles, not one person has run into some magical portal leading out of Dis. They also haven&amp;rsquo;t run into magma for that matter. Instead, the deeper you go, the colder Cocytus becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to the very bottom myself. I&amp;rsquo;m told that down there, the air is cold enough to freeze your blood and shatter your skin. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s true. I could certainly believe it. On the rare occasions I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Cocytus, I&amp;rsquo;ve always had to turn back once the walls became more ice than rock and the narrow walkways became a death trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the numbers to do it, Cocytus is still a valuable place to settle. Just remember that when hunger, cold and greed are your constant companions, none of the damned can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pale-witch&#34;&gt;The Pale Witch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve told you about The Slaughterman previously but Hell has other legendary figures, each with their own sobriquets: The Ripper, The Grim Doctor, The Tyrant and many more. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve only encountered one of these figures. During my last stay in Hell, I came across The Pale Witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is always the case with legends, the truth about The Pale Witch tends to get lost amid the superstition. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard plenty of theories as to what she is. The Pale Witch is a shtriga who has the power of the evil eye. The Pale Witch is a gorgon whose gaze turns her victims to stone. The Pale Witch is a succubus who entraps the minds of those she wishes to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that is bullshit. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen The Pale Witch and I know the truth about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first saw her, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise who I was looking at. She was naked and locked in combat with an armed resident so I just took her for fresh meat. Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip for you: if you see a resident fighting fresh meat, kill both of them while they&amp;rsquo;re distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I planned to do exactly that but something about the fight seemed off. Residents usually have the upper hand in a fight against fresh meat and this particular bout definitely seemed about as one-sided as it gets. She was naked whereas he was clad in leather and bone. She was unarmed whereas he had a club. She was waifish whereas he was huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite him having the advantage&amp;hellip; the resident was clearly terrified of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules of Hell dictated that he should have cracked her skull, taken her skin and eaten her flesh but that just wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening. He was uncoordinated and apparently desperate to escape. Every swing he took was clumsy and the blows he did manage to land on her didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could only stare as this naked, vulnerable woman took the resident&amp;rsquo;s club from his unresisting hand and swung it at his knee. I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to the sound of bones breaking by now but this time the noise caught me off guard. How the fuck was this happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She brought the club down on his other knee, then his elbows, then his ankles, then his shoulders. She left him broken and screaming on the floor. She could have finished him off with a blow to the head, stolen his clothing and taken her rightful place as a resident. That&amp;rsquo;s how Hell works! Those are the rules I&amp;rsquo;ve learned through bloody trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;rsquo;t what happened. Rather than kill him, she sat down beside him in the mud and took his hand in hers. I actually thought she was going to console him&amp;hellip; until she started breaking his fingers. One by one, she snapped the fingers on both his hands with a calmness that made no sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torture is common in Hell but there&amp;rsquo;s always a purpose behind it. The people in Skin Street do it out of sadism and the people in The Boneyard do it for their insane purification rituals. This woman did it without emotion and without reason. I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know if she even understood that she was hurting him. I don&amp;rsquo;t think her mind works the same way as ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the resident lost consciousness. A man can only take so much pain before the shock gets him. Surely now she&amp;rsquo;d be satisfied? Surely she&amp;rsquo;d take his clothes and restore Hell&amp;rsquo;s order?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. She stood up, tilted her head slightly and uttered a noise for the first time. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a victory cry, nor was it even a sigh of relief. Instead, the sound she made was nothing more than a faintly bemused, &amp;ldquo;Hmmm?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as if she couldn&amp;rsquo;t comprehend why her plaything had stopped moving. She stood up and stepped away from him, apparently content to leave him alive, unconscious and crippled on the ground. She kept his club but didn&amp;rsquo;t take his clothing. The cold and rain didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to bother her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that instant, I knew I was looking at The Pale Witch. I looked into her eyes and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fucking move. I understood what she was straight away and the sheer terror of it froze me. The Pale Witch isn&amp;rsquo;t a shtriga, she isn&amp;rsquo;t a gorgon and she isn&amp;rsquo;t a succubus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pale Witch is a cambion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to put into words exactly how paralysing the sight of a cambion is. That perfectly serene face and those dead, staring eyes just don&amp;rsquo;t belong on a body that&amp;rsquo;s otherwise human. It was like looking into the face of a mannequin and knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s looking back at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmmm?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That noise again. That kind of detached curiosity shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the world of predator and prey, might makes right, survival of the fittest. Nobody in the city of Dis has any right to make that noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took an awkward step towards me and I saw that her right leg was broken. It seemed that her fight with the resident had injured her after all, she just didn&amp;rsquo;t notice it. She tried to walk normally, completely unaware that one of her legs had an extra joint. I don&amp;rsquo;t care how tough you are, nobody should be able to put their full weight onto a broken leg without even wincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmmm?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stepped closer. Her zombie shuffle steadily closing the gap between us as I stared at her. She raised her club and my survival instincts finally kicked into gear. Her transfixing spell broke just enough for me to stumble backwards and avoid her swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran from a woman with a broken leg and I&amp;rsquo;m not even ashamed of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on my experience, there are some things I just can&amp;rsquo;t comprehend. The Pale Witch is a cambion, I&amp;rsquo;m certain of it. She was born in Hell and Hell is all she&amp;rsquo;s ever known. She also looked to be about thirty years old. That just shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No baby survives long in Dis. Even if they had a tribe to protect them, there just isn&amp;rsquo;t enough nourishment for an infant to grow into a toddler, let alone an adult. The Pale Witch is a walking impossibility. Her existence is a defiance of all reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would endure every torture the people of Skin Street and the Boneyard could conceive of if it meant I would never have to look into her eyes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Chapter 4: Dementia</title>
		<link>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/</link>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back to the game, I was getting very upset and confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about the way the monster looked at me. The game COULDN&amp;rsquo;T have heard
what I said, that&amp;rsquo;s impossible. It had to be a random occurrence. But why did
it happen precisely at the moment I insulted the monster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about this game made any sense. The new Godzilla monsters, the weird
replacement monsters, out of place imagery like the green temples, quiz levels,
and the red monster chases. It didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to add up in any kind of meaningful
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it was a prank, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t funny in any way I could understand, and they
clearly put far too much effort into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they were trying to make a genuine sequel with new Godzilla monsters,
then why did they add&amp;hellip; everything else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was some kind of art experiment? Some group project made by a bunch of
really talented and crazy people, and they lost the cartridge somehow? Or maybe
they intended for some random person to find it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all just fruitless guessing. As far as I could tell, there was only one
way to figure out what the deal with this game was: To play it through to the end.
Maybe, just maybe, there would be something in the credits, an explanation by
the creators as to why they made this. Or it could be something much more cryptic
and strange, maybe even something horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I got a good look at the Dementia board, I considered replaying Trance to
see if the red monster would look at me again. But I decided against it. I wanted
to keep moving forward. I was also somewhat worried that backtracking might cause
the game to become even more strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dementia board music sounded a lot like the Saturn music, except it was slowed
down, and played with a piano-sounding instrument. Like most of these new map themes,
it had a dangerous suspenseful feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While listening to the music, I looked at the Dementia board. There were four
boss monsters this time: SpaceGodzilla, Manda, Gigan, and Baragon. I was surprised
that there were two new Toho monsters this time. But the best surprise was still
to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started the Quiz level. Here&amp;rsquo;s another list of results in the same format as
the last one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely sure at the time what Face meant by &amp;ldquo;new monster&amp;rdquo;, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
resist answering &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;, just to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was mind blowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/dementiaboardanguirus.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/dementiaboardanguirus.png&#34;  alt=&#34;New playable form: Anguirus&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game took me back to the board and I had a new playable monster in the form
of Anguirus! Ever since I was kid, I always wanted to play as Anguirus, since he
was my second favorite Godzilla monster (And plus I never liked Mothra all that
much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved my new Anguirus piece over to the level right next to it, eager to test
out my new monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the level description I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about Anguirus a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the up and down buttons you could choose whether Anguirus stood in a bipedal
stance or crawled around on all fours. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a huge difference, but being able
to stand was helpful in boss fights, and crawling sometimes helped dodge obstacles
and attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could punch and kick like Godzilla, but no tail whip. Instead he had something
far more interesting: The ability to curl up into a spiked ball of death and roll
around. You could still take damage, but it was lessened. It was a good way of
clearing out stage enemies, but unfortunately doing this also drained the power
bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the spiked ball wasn&amp;rsquo;t his only special ability. When you pressed Start,
he would fire a beam of energy from his mouth. It resembled Titanosaurus&amp;rsquo; sonar
attack, and if this were a hack it may have been inspired by the Roar attack from
Atari&amp;rsquo;s Godzilla fighting games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of note is that when playing as Anguirus, the &amp;ldquo;Level&amp;rdquo; meter gets glitched up.
Judging by the life and power bar, I&amp;rsquo;d say he&amp;rsquo;s on Level 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto the level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/anguirusrevealed.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/anguirusrevealed.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Anguirus in-game sprite&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed from the level icon, these levels are green palette swaps
of the ground and background tiles from the Blue Mountains. But what immediately
caught my attention was the water, which has a transparency effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was that even possible for an NES game? I know the Super Nintendo could do it,
but I had never seen a transparency effect in a game on an NES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Mountains music was played with the same instrument as the Blue Mountains,
but the melody was totally different. It was a very simple song with a lot of
abrupt pauses, followed by a loud note every few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went through the usual strolling through the level. And again there were
no monsters or anything, but pretty soon I had reached a cliff above the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/angocean.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was nowhere to go but into the water, so down I went. The water transparency
made things a bit harder to see, but it&amp;rsquo;s tolerable. After going underwater I
encountered two new enemies: a giant piranha and some kind of spiky bottom feeder
thing. I liked the piranha because I could easily tell what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a sane enemy design that would appear in a real game, and there were very
few enemies like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/angocean2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;rsquo;t take much hits to kill, but they were quite annoying, and could
considerably trim down your life if they got close enough. They also tend to
travel in packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the bottom feeders, they&amp;rsquo;re easy to deal with. They swim along the bottom
of the screen towards you, and are easily crushed with the roll attack or jumped
over. In this screencap you can see me about to run one of them over, and there&amp;rsquo;s
a pack of piranha behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I beat that level, I moved Godzilla onto the blue castle icon. I started
the level and I got a title screen, with the text &amp;ldquo;UNFORGIVING COLD&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/unforgivingcold.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level itself looked like a castle dungeon made of blue bricks,with rows of
identical white statue faces on the walls. These statue faces had a permanent
look of horror on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also some flickering gray static, which didn&amp;rsquo;t really obscure my vision,
but it adds to the very unsettling mood of these levels. The music was a twelve
second loop of a low pitched choir vocalizing, that sounded very familiar to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I played through one of these levels I got this sudden, horrible feeling
of anxiety. I had the feeling that the farther I progressed through the level,
the closer I was getting to something unspeakably evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t any enemies, but these were the some of the longest levels in the
game. I only played one level, but it took seven minutes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/bluetemple.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to admit it to myself at the time, but I realized something playing
the blue castle level: This game has the power to make the player feel certain
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean in the sense that you get irritated playing a crappy game, or get
unnerved by something scary in a game. What I mean is that certain events in this
game can instantly make you start feeling something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that sounds completely insane. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame you for not believing me, I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe any of this either if I didn&amp;rsquo;t play the game myself. But there
is something very, very wrong with this game, and I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how to
explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; then it was time to fight Baragon&amp;rsquo;s replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Baragon was originally the smallest monster in the game, his replacement
was the largest. It was so tall in fact, that the &amp;ldquo;ground&amp;rdquo; was noticeably lowered,
and Not-Baragon&amp;rsquo;s head still barely avoided collision with the bar at the top of
the screen. And he was just as frighteningly bizarre as he was huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/confrontingnotbaragon.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering how he attacks without arms. Well, he has the most powerful
kick in the game. But his other fighting technique is much stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First he blasts a cloudy breath of pixels down at you, which causes you to freeze,
then he walks back to the right corner of the screen and&amp;hellip; extends a huge gatling
gun from his abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/notbaragongun.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might seem amusing to you, but it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t to me when I was playing
the game. This attack is almost as annoying as Gigan&amp;rsquo;s saw, and Not-Baragon could
have been unbeatable if he consistently used it. Thankfully he only did it twice
while fighting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you unfreeze, you can run up and start damaging the gun, which does extra
damage to him. This helped me to destroy him, and then it was time to play the
third level type. I decided that I was going to use Anguirus to fight Manda and
Gigan, and then fight SpaceGodzilla as Godzilla (it was only fitting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into the battles, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the third level type: The Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arctic is exactly what you&amp;rsquo;d guess from the name, an icy tundra with a few
watery segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/glacier1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music reminded me a bit of &amp;ldquo;Northern Hemispheres&amp;rdquo; from Donkey Kong Country,
in 8 bit form. A very dangerous sounding song, it made me think about being
trapped in a tundra and freezing to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were two new enemies in this stage. The first was a creature frozen in a
block of ice. They block your way and you have to use the heat beam to thaw them
out of the ice. They look a bit like a smaller version of Not-Gezora, only
without the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When freed, they do a strange crawling movement and push you backwards.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t cause any damage but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dealing with the Iceman, I kept walking for a minute or two and came upon
a water segment. I jumped in, and this time I managed to get a screencap showing
how the water splashes when you jump in. Dunno how they programmed that, but it&amp;rsquo;s
pretty impressive. Another interesting thing is how the screen changes focus when
you go underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the other new enemy, a little thing I call &amp;ldquo;Spike Walker&amp;rdquo;. They
walk towards you and explode randomly(or instantly if you attack them), sending
spikes in every direction. The spikes don&amp;rsquo;t do much damage but they did get me
dangerously close to falling into a pit a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, speaking of the pits: Down into the water, the game has a platformer element:
bottomless pits. There weren&amp;rsquo;t any of these in the original game, since it was
strictly an action game, but the pits were a neat addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting back on land, I encountered a very unexpected miniboss: Maguma,
the Walrus Kaiju. I know this game had some obscure monsters to begin with,
but wow. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m complaining, it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty cool cameo for an unappreciated
kaiju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maguma&amp;rsquo;s fighting tactics were very simple, he had a freeze beam, and he could
charge into you. Not very challenging but certainly more entertaining than the
Matango miniboss in the original game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One really interesting thing about Maguma is that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t die when you defeat
him, he turns tail and retreats. This was the first time I had ever seen an enemy
monster change direction, let alone retreat. I tried to chase after him, but he
dissapeared after I got in the water. Poor bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that does it for the Arctic. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the Manda fight next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention before, but the music that played during the new monster fights
is re-used from themes actually in the games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the themes have been:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Titanosaurus: Gezora&amp;rsquo;s music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biollante: Hedorah&amp;rsquo;s music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orga: Baragon/Moguera&amp;rsquo;s music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manda: Varan&amp;rsquo;s music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spacegodzilla: MechaGodzilla&amp;rsquo;s music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the fight, Manda was a fairly crafty opponent. When it realized one tactic
was ineffective, it would immediately change to a different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manda used quite a few tricks, like spitting fire, biting, and the most
irritating of all, constricting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/mandaconstrict.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mercilessly drain your life down like Gigan&amp;rsquo;s cutter, but it was by
far Manda&amp;rsquo;s strongest attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/mandaatragon.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last thing to note (that I found pretty cool) was that the Atragon showed up
during the fight to help me out. Manda crushed it with ease, but it was still
cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I slayed Manda, I played through an Arctic level for health power-ups and
then it was on to Gigan&amp;rsquo;s replacement. When the fight started, I was very
confused, because there was nothing there. I thought this was going to be like
the Titanosaurus &amp;ldquo;fight&amp;rdquo; in Pathos, but just about the time it would have been
going back to the map, a piranha appeared onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t there for long. As soon as it appeared, the speakers emitted an
ear-splitting screech, and Not-Gigan flew in and ripped the poor fish into
pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s one way to get the player on their toes. That abrupt entrance
scared the hell out of me and got my adrenaline rushing. Which in retrospect was
a good thing, because Not-Gigan was one of the fastest, most unrelenting
opponents in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not-Gigan was tough, but my new skills with Anguirus helped to even the score.
This was still an incredibly intense fight! Not-Gigan&amp;rsquo;s attacks consisted of a
some kind of blood laser he spews from his mouth, and a downward slash. I was
expecting some hellish variant of the buzzsaw attack, but thankfully there
didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Howl attack was invaluable in defeating him. I would have taken more
screencaps of the fight, but I really had to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, there was just one monster left to take down: SpaceGodzilla. As
mentioned earlier, I used Godzilla for this fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spacegodzilla&amp;rsquo;s fighting technique was rather frustrating, but admittedly a very
clever idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;SpaceGodzilla would use his energy to create two flying crystals, which would
reach the ground and become crystal spires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These spires not only block you from reaching SpaceGodzilla, but it also allowed
him to constantly recharge to full energy, and blast you with a deadly fully
charged Corona Beam until you broke the spires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;SpaceGodzilla would eventually drain his own spires of energy until they
shattered, but if you waited for that to happen you&amp;rsquo;d probably lose a lot of
life. Heat beams actually seemed to re-energize the spires, so you had to use
physical attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you finally got close enough to hit SpaceGodzilla, he was no pushover. When
I punched him, he hit me back just as hard. SpaceGodzilla does everything in his
power to knock you back to the left corner of the screen, so he can create more
spires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time this was over, I only had about five life bars left. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t
matter, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to fight anymore. I needed to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/dementiaboardred.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we go again. I decided right then that I really wanted to see the end of
this game. As terrifying as these levels could sometimes be, I had to beat them
to get though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this chase I tried out Anguirus, since his roll attack allowed me to move
faster than Godzilla or Mothra. The chase started off like the first two, except
there was a river of blood below the ground. I was beginning to get the hang of
it, and the extra speed from the Roll helped me get an edge on the red monster.
Especially since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about a power limit, and could keep
rolling endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/angchase1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the previous levels with water, the ground inevitably reached a stop. So I
rolled off into the blood. To my surprise, the hell beast didn&amp;rsquo;t follow after
me, it just stopped at the edge of the ground and grimaced. &amp;ldquo;I guess it can&amp;rsquo;t
swim&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went &amp;ldquo;underblood&amp;rdquo; and continued moving. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything around, but I
knew something was up. The chase wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to end that easily, could it?
Surely something else had to show up. And sure enough, I heard the bellowing
roar, sounding slightly different&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/angchase3.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-4-dementia/angchase3.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Hell beast fish form&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;And the monster was following after me in a new aquatic body! I had no idea
it was a shapeshifter. After it reappeared, the chase started to get into the
difficulty I had expected. Being submerged slowed me down, putting me and the
beast at about the same speed. The only thing that would keep me alive was fast
thinking and reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered some bottomless pits, in which mines floated up from. I assume
that if you hit one, it would damage you and knock you back. Considering how
fast the red monster swims, hitting the mines would be instant death, so I went
through great effort to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t all I had to be wary of. Halfway through the chase the hell
beast revealed yet another surprise: a tentacle formed of intestine and tipped
with a clawed set of jaws burst from its mouth, trying to pull me in and devour
me. I only barely avoided both the tentacle and the mines, but I could tell the
beast was getting desperate, because the chase was nearly over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And about a minute later, I had spotted a bit of ground that served as the exit.
I leaped with all the might I could muster (without breaking my controller). The
beast screamed with rage and jumped out of the blood river in one last attempt
to drag me down, but I escaped its grasp. This time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fell back on my bed and took a deep breath, satisfied with yet another
successful escape. Now I was headed to the fifth world: Entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! I&amp;rsquo;m back from my training op, and I have a lot of really interesting stories to share with you. I&amp;rsquo;ve got enough that I&amp;rsquo;m going to break them up into two parts, this being the first. I&amp;rsquo;d love to put them all in one entry, but I just haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to write them all down yet. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything too crazy happen while I was out there, but we did have one incident with a rookie that I found relevant. Since I’m sure you guys have been waiting for these, I&amp;rsquo;ll just get right into the stories. I&amp;rsquo;ll assign each batch of stories to the person who told them to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K.D is a vet who&amp;rsquo;s been an SAR officer for about fifteen years. She specializes in high elevation mountain rescues, and is widely considered one of the best in her field. She was one of the more enthusiastic storytellers, and since we were together a fair amount during exercises, she ended up telling me about four that really stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first she told me in response to my asking about her most traumatic calls. She shook her head and told me that really bad calls happen more frequently on the mountain, since the potential for nasty accidents is higher. About five years ago, one of the parks she worked at had a string of disappearances. It was a bad year, she said, one of the worst on record as far as weather went. They were getting about a foot of new snow every couple of days, and there were a few avalanches that killed some climbers. They&amp;rsquo;d warned people about staying on the mapped areas, but of course, there are always those who don&amp;rsquo;t listen. In one particularly nasty case, an entire family got wiped out because the father decided he knew better than the officials, and he took them out into an area that wasn&amp;rsquo;t safe. They were snowshoeing, and, as best K.D could figure, they&amp;rsquo;d walked onto a shelf of snow that looked solid, but actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t. It gave way, and this family went ass over teakettle almost three hundred feet down a slope. They landed on the rocks at the bottom, and the parents died instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the kids did as well, but the other two survived. One had a broken leg and fractured ribs, the other was almost unharmed save for some bruising and a sprained ankle. The uninjured child left his sibling behind and set out to find help. K.D said the kid didn&amp;rsquo;t make it more than half a mile before a storm overtook him. He stopped to try and get warm, or maybe just to rest, and ended up freezing to death. They ended up finding the family with the help of some witnesses who saw them heading out into the wilderness, and she was the one to find the kid who&amp;rsquo;d frozen to death looking for help. She said it had started to snow, just enough to obscure long-distance vision, but not enough to make searching impossible. She saw a figure sitting in the snow up ahead, and she got to it as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She described, in detail, how as she got closer, she realized first that it was a child, second that they were deceased, and third that they had frozen in one of the most pitiful positions she&amp;rsquo;s ever found a corpse in. The kid was sitting upright, with his knees tucked up against his chest. His arms were curled around them, and his head was tucked up in his coat. When she moved the coat to look at his face, she saw that he’d died crying. His face was twisted, and the tears were frozen on his cheeks. She said it was painfully obvious that the kid was terrified when he succumbed to hypothermia, and as a mother, it broke her heart. She told me, repeatedly, that she hopes the father is burning in hell as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other traumatic story she told me that stood out, in my mind, was one that happened when she was a rookie. Her team got a report of an experienced climber who hadn&amp;rsquo;t come home the previous day. His wife was convinced that something bad had happened, because he&amp;rsquo;d never failed to come home on time. They went out looking for him, and had to climb what sounded like some very technically challenging parts of the mountain. They got to a relatively flat area, and K.D started seeing blood in the snow. She followed the trail, and as she went, she started seeing little bits of tissue. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure exactly what body part it had come from, but the farther she followed it, the more there was. She follows this blood-and-tissue trail to a sheltered area under a cliff face, and she finds the climber. She said there was so much blood, more than she&amp;rsquo;d ever seen before. He was lying face down, one arm stretched in front of him, as if he&amp;rsquo;d died crawling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked closer, and sees that he&amp;rsquo;s been partially disemboweled, which is where the tissue had come from. The guy has an ice pick tucked into a hip holster, and it&amp;rsquo;s covered in blood. Of course, they&amp;rsquo;ll never be sure exactly what happened, but she said as best she can figure, this is what went down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy had been attempting to climb up to the next area, and had been using his ice ax to ascend. He&amp;rsquo;d probably hit a loose patch, and had fallen. On the way down, or possibly when he landed, he&amp;rsquo;d gotten impaled by the ax, and it had disemboweled him. He&amp;rsquo;d dragged himself along, tearing pieces of himself out as he went, and had died under the cliff face. She isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly bothered by gore, but I guess a few of the guys who came to help her remove the body threw up when they turned him over and a good portion of his intestines spilled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned to her that I was interested in hearing about any experiences she had with people completely disappearing. Her eyes light up, and she leaned in close to me, &amp;lsquo;Wanna hear a real doozy?&amp;rsquo; she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tells me about how, when she first started, there was a case that got a lot of attention in the media. A family had been out berry picking in an area of the forest very close to the entrance of the park. They had two little boys, both under the age of five, and at some point during the day, one of them vanishes. There&amp;rsquo;s an absolutely massive search, and they find absolutely nothing. It&amp;rsquo;s another of those cases where it&amp;rsquo;s like the kid was never there in the first place. The dogs just sit down and don&amp;rsquo;t pick up on anything, and no trace of the kid is found. The search goes on for about two months, but is eventually called off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to six months later. The family comes back to place flowers at a memorial that&amp;rsquo;s been set up there for the kid. They bring their other son. While they&amp;rsquo;re placing the flowers, they lose sight of the kid for about three seconds, and in that span of time, he vanishes into thin air. Now obviously, the parents are beyond devastated. It&amp;rsquo;s awful enough to lose one child, but to lose two is beyond imagining. The search is huge, one of the largest in state history. There are about three hundred volunteers combing every inch of this park, looking for the kid. But again, there&amp;rsquo;s no trace of him. The search goes on for about a week, with people looking miles from the part of the park he vanished from. And then, almost two weeks later, a volunteer almost fifteen miles from the designated search area radios in that he&amp;rsquo;s found the kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They assumed that the kid was dead, but the volunteer says that he&amp;rsquo;s not only alive, he&amp;rsquo;s in good shape. K.D and her team go out to recover the kid, and when they get there, she can&amp;rsquo;t believe that this is the kid that’s been missing. His clothes are clean, there&amp;rsquo;s no dirt on him anywhere, and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear traumatized. The volunteer says he found the kid sitting on a log, playing with a little twig bundle that&amp;rsquo;s bound together with some old rope. K.D asks him where he&amp;rsquo;s been, who he was with for those two weeks, and the kid tells her that he&amp;rsquo;s been with &amp;rsquo;the fuzzy man&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now K.D firmly believes in Bigfoot, so she gets all excited and asks what he means by fuzzy. Was he hairy? But the kid says no, he wasn’t hairy. He was a &amp;lsquo;fuzzy man&amp;rsquo;, and he describes a man that’s blurry, &amp;rsquo;like when you close your eyes but not all the way closed.&amp;rsquo; He says the man came out of the trees and took the kid with him deep into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kid says he slept in a hollow tree, and the fuzzy man gave him berries to eat. K.D asks if the man was mean, if he scared the kid, and the kid says &amp;rsquo;no, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t scary. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t like how he didn’t have eyes.&amp;rsquo; K.D says they get the kid back to headquarters, and a cop takes him into town to talk to him more about what happened. She&amp;rsquo;s friends with the cop that talked to him, and she said the kid described being kept in this tree by the fuzzy man, and given berries whenever he was hungry. He was allowed to wander around a very specific clearing, but when he tried to go further, the fuzzy man would &amp;lsquo;get mad and yell real loud even though he didn&amp;rsquo;t have a mouth&amp;rsquo;. When the kid got scared at night, the fuzzy man &amp;lsquo;made it go brighter&amp;rsquo; and gave him the twig bundle. He said the fuzzy man was going to keep him, but he had to let him go because the kid wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;rsquo;the right kind.&amp;rsquo; He either can&amp;rsquo;t or won’t elaborate more on that. The cops are just sort of left scratching their heads, and the search for his brother is renewed with no results. The kid has no idea where his brother might be, and they never find him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last story that K.D told me was of something that happened to her when she got separated from her training group when she was a rookie. They were learning the basics of high elevation belaying on a well-mapped side of the mountain, and she had to use the bathroom. She went off about fifty yards from the group during a meal break, and did her business. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell the rest exactly as she told it to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I go to take a piss, and once I&amp;rsquo;m done, I start going back to the group. But I&amp;rsquo;ve only gotten about five feet when I realize that I have no idea where I am. And this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;lsquo;oh, I got turned around&amp;rsquo; lost. I mean I had literally no fucking clue where I was. If you&amp;rsquo;d asked me, I don’t even think I&amp;rsquo;d have been able to tell you what state we were in. It was sort of how I imagine people with amnesia feel, you know? You’re completely lost, and you have no idea what to do. So I stood there for a while, just trying to figure out where the fuck I was and what I was supposed to do. But the longer I stand there, the more confused and turned around I get, so I started walking. As I recall, I just picked a random direction and went for it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And as I&amp;rsquo;m walking, it&amp;rsquo;s just getting worse and worse to the point where I have no concept of why I&amp;rsquo;m on the mountain in the first place. I&amp;rsquo;m just trudging through the snow, and then I start hearing this voice. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of inside my head, almost. Like if a frog could talk, all low and croaky. And it&amp;rsquo;s telling me over and over &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s okay, it&amp;rsquo;s okay, you just need to find something to eat. Find something to eat and you&amp;rsquo;ll be okay, just keep walking and find something to eat. Eat. Eat.&amp;rsquo; So I start looking around for anything that I can eat, and I swear to god I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt that hungry in my whole life. It was bottomless, and I think I&amp;rsquo;d have eaten just about anything you put in front of me right then. I had no concept of time, so I had no idea how long I&amp;rsquo;d been out when I hear an actual voice coming toward me. I go toward it and see one of the other SARs, and he looks fucking terrified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s running toward me, asking if I&amp;rsquo;m okay and what the hell I’m doing out here. And the scary thing was, as he&amp;rsquo;s running toward me, I kind of see myself reaching into my belt for my hunting knife. I&amp;rsquo;m not even really thinking about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but what I am thinking is that I have to eat. If I don&amp;rsquo;t eat, I&amp;rsquo;ll never be okay again, so I just have to eat. He sees me doing that and he backs off right away. He yells at me to put my knife away, that he&amp;rsquo;s not gonna hurt me, and that kind of snaps me back. All of a sudden, I know exactly where I am, and I put the knife away. I run to him and ask him how long I&amp;rsquo;ve been gone, thinking he’ll tell me I&amp;rsquo;ve been gone for half an hour or so. But he tells me I&amp;rsquo;ve been gone for two fucking days. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone over two peaks and ended up almost on the other side of the mountain, and if I&amp;rsquo;d kept going, I would have ended up wandering into about three hundred miles of wilderness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They’d never have found me. He can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;m not dead, and of course, I don’t know what the fuck to think. To me, no time has passed at all. I don’t say anything, I just go back with him to a rendezvous point and I’m taken back to HQ to be airlifted to the hospital. When I get there, they do all kinds of tests and try to figure out what happened. As best they can guess, I had some kind of weird fugue state, which is kind of like amnesia, or a weird seizure that knocked my brain out of whack. But the truth is that we really don&amp;rsquo;t know. It&amp;rsquo;s never happened again, but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you, ever since then I never go out there alone. People rag on me for making them come with me when I have to leave the group, but I just tell &amp;rsquo;em that listening to me piss in the snow is better than losing me for two fucking days on a freezing mountain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next person I talked to was E.W, a former trainer who now works as an EMT. He still comes to ops like this to help out, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t work full-time for us anymore. He specialized in finding lost kids; he just seemed to have a sixth sense when it came to knowing where they&amp;rsquo;d gone. He&amp;rsquo;s a legend among the more senior vets, but he gets embarrassed if you compliment him on his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sat down with me at dinner one evening, and we ended up swapping stories. Most of them were just casual, but when we got on the subject of our weirder calls, I mentioned that I’d had a buddy who&amp;rsquo;d gone up a set of stairs. He got kind of quiet and asked me if I&amp;rsquo;d heard of a little boy who&amp;rsquo;d disappeared from his park a few years back. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t, so he told me this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were out looking for this eleven-year-old boy, Joey, who&amp;rsquo;d gone missing near a river. Of course, the first thought was that he&amp;rsquo;d fallen in and drowned, but when they brought dogs out, they led SAR officers away from the river and up into a very densely forested area. When we do searches for people, we search in a grid pattern, and we search every ‘box’ of the grid incredibly thoroughly. What E.W&amp;rsquo;s team noticed right away was that a very strange pattern was emerging. Dogs in alternating boxes were picking up Joey&amp;rsquo;s scent, but losing it when they overlapped with another box. If you think of a checkerboard, Joey&amp;rsquo;s scent was being picked up in random black squares, but never in red. This, of course, didn’t make any sense, because how could the kid bounce from area to area without leaving a scent in each place he passed? E.W and his partner pass into a new box of the grid, and E.W notices a set of stairs about fifty yards away. He tells his partner that they need to go check near it, but his partner flat-out refuses. He tells E.W that he&amp;rsquo;s made it a point never to go near any stairs he sees, and that while it may be routine, he&amp;rsquo;s not to pretend that it&amp;rsquo;s normal. He tells E.W that he’ll wait in sight while E.W checks. E.W says he was irritated, but he felt for the guy, and didn&amp;rsquo;t push him on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I walked over to the stairs. They were small, kind of like stairs into a basement. I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel strongly one way or the other about them, the stairs I mean, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t scared or anything. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m like everyone else, and I just prefer not to think about them too much. Anyway, I went over and I could see that there was something lying on the bottom step, sort of curled up. My heart sinks, because of course, you always hope for the best. And we were confident that we&amp;rsquo;d find this kid alive, because he&amp;rsquo;d only been missing for a few hours. But I knew right away that it was him, and that he was dead. He was curled up in a little ball on the step, holding his stomach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It looked like he&amp;rsquo;d been in horrible pain when he died, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any blood, except some on his lips and chin. I radioed in that I&amp;rsquo;d found him, and we got his body back to command. That poor family, they were devastated. The parents couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand how he&amp;rsquo;d be dead, &amp;lsquo;cause he&amp;rsquo;d only been gone for such a short amount of time. And on top of that, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any obvious cause of death, which just made it worse. I figured he’d probably eaten something poisonous, since he was holding his stomach when I found him, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to guess. It&amp;rsquo;s hard enough to hear that your kid is dead, let alone have some stupid SAR guy guessing about what happened. They took him away, and I went home and tried not to think about it. I hate finding dead kids, man. I loved this job, but it&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons I left. I&amp;rsquo;ve got two daughters, and the thought of losing them that way just&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He choked up a little here. I&amp;rsquo;m not great with emotional stuff like that, and it&amp;rsquo;s always sort of awkward to see a grown man cry, so I didn’t really know what to do. He pulled himself together eventually, though, and he kept going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t always hear back from the coroners about cause of death. It’s not really our job to know, I guess, and sometimes, if they think it’s foul play, they won&amp;rsquo;t tell us because of legal bullshit. But I&amp;rsquo;ve got a friend who works for the sheriff&amp;rsquo;s department, and he&amp;rsquo;ll usually pass along any interesting info if I ask. In this case, though, I actually got a call from him about a week later. He asks if I remember the kid, and of course I do, and he says some seriously weird shit is going on. He tells me, &amp;lsquo;E.W, man, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna think I&amp;rsquo;m crazy, but the coroner has no idea what happened to this kid. He&amp;rsquo;s never seen anything like it.&amp;rsquo; My friend goes on to tell me that when the coroner opened the kid up, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t even believe what he was seeing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The kid&amp;rsquo;s organs were like Swiss cheese. Quarter-sized holes were punched clean through just about every single organ this kid had, aside from his heart and lungs. But his colon, his stomach, his kidneys and even one of his testicles, were full of these clean holes. My friend said the coroner described it as if someone had taken a hole-punch and punched holes out of everything, they were so neat. But the kid didn&amp;rsquo;t have a scratch on him, no entry or exit wounds. The closest anyone there had ever seen like it was a guy who&amp;rsquo;d filled himself full of buckshot a year or so back while cleaning his rifle. No one had a clue what could possibly have caused it. My friend asked me if I&amp;rsquo;d ever heard of anything like it, or if we&amp;rsquo;d had similar cases in the past. But I&amp;rsquo;d never even heard of something like that, and I told him I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be of any help to him. As far as I know, the coroner determined the cause of death as something like &amp;lsquo;massive internal bleeding&amp;rsquo;, but no one knows what really happened.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to forget that kid. I have nightmares about it sometimes. I don&amp;rsquo;t let my kids go into the woods alone, and when we go together, I never let them out of my sight. I used to love it out here. But that case, and a couple others, just sort of ruined it for me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner was over, so we started to clean up and go back to our cabins. Before we went our separate ways, he put his hand on my shoulder and looked at me really close. He tells me that there are bad things out here. Things that don&amp;rsquo;t care if we have families or lives, or that we can think and feel. He tells me to be careful, and he walks away. I didn&amp;rsquo;t a chance to talk with him again, but that story stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pure coincidence, I got to talk to another vet, P.B, who&amp;rsquo;s been in the SAR field for years. We were partnered on a grid sweep during a training exercise, and we were chatting casually about how we liked the job, what kinds of things we&amp;rsquo;d seen, and the like. At one point, we passed an old set of stairs, though these were probably from an old fire lookout, given the area that we were in. I sort of casually mentioned that I was curious about the stairs, and that I wished I knew more about them. He got kind of quiet and looked like he wanted to tell me something, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if he should. Finally, he told me to turn my radio off. Obviously this is something we are never, ever supposed to do, but I did it, and he did the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About seven years ago, he tells me, he was out on a call with a rookie. They were in an area of the park that&amp;rsquo;s had a lot of strange reports and events. Disappearances, stories about lights in the forest, odd noises, things like that. The rookie was totally spooked, kept going on and on about &amp;rsquo;things out in the woods&amp;rsquo;. According to P.B: &amp;ldquo;The guy wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stop talking about &amp;rsquo;the Goatman&amp;rsquo;. Just on and on, &amp;lsquo;Goatman&amp;rsquo; this and &amp;lsquo;Goatman&amp;rsquo; that. Finally, I told him that there was plenty else to be afraid of out here that was very real, and that he’d better get over this thing with the Goatman. The rookie wanted to know what kinds of things I was talking about, and I just told him to shut up and walk. We crested a little ridge and there was a staircase about ten yards ahead. The rookie stops dead in his tracks and just stands there looking at them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I tell him, &amp;lsquo;See? That&amp;rsquo;s something you should be afraid of.&amp;rsquo; The rookie asks me what the hell these are doing out here, and for some reason, I just open up and tell him the truth. Or what I&amp;rsquo;ve been told is the truth. I could have gotten in a lot of trouble for doing what I did, and I could get in a lot of trouble for repeating it to you. But you&amp;rsquo;re a nice kid, and I want you to stop looking into this. Quit while you&amp;rsquo;re ahead. So I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what I know, under the condition that you never breathe a word of this to the supes.&amp;rdquo; I told him I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say a word, and he double-checks that our radios are off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I first started out, we were a little less tight-lipped about them, and other things that happen out here. We warned people before they were even hired that there was weird shit going on. I guess the Forest Service was tired of having such a massive turnover rate, and they wanted people to know what they were getting into. So they started having people sign these agreements that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go to the media about what they were going to see. The FS didn&amp;rsquo;t want to scare people away, so the last thing they needed were spooked rookies running off to the media with stories of ghosts and haunted stairs. But eventually, they found that the agreements weren&amp;rsquo;t necessary. People not only didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about what they saw, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. A few times, media tried to talk to people when kids or hikers would disappear, and no one would say a word. I can&amp;rsquo;t really explain it. I guess we just&amp;hellip; don’t really want to admit anything is wrong. This is our job, to be out in the woods every single day. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to be spooked, and the best way to avoid that is to pretend like everything&amp;rsquo;s okay. So I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you everything I can think of, and after that, I&amp;rsquo;m done talking about it for good. And I expect you not to bring it up around me, ever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The stairs have been out here for as long as the parks have existed. We have records going back decades describing them. Sometimes people go up them, and nothing happens. Other times&amp;hellip; look, I really don&amp;rsquo;t like talking about this, but sometimes, really bad shit happens. I saw one guy get his hand sliced clean off when he got to the top step. He reached out to touch a tree branch, and it happened so fast. One second his hand was there, and the next it was gone. Completely clean wound. We didn&amp;rsquo;t find his hand, and the guy almost died. Another time, a woman touched one of the stairs, and a blood vessel in her brain exploded. Literally exploded, like a water balloon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She sort of stumbled down and came over to me, and all she got out was &amp;lsquo;I think something is wrong with me.&amp;rsquo; She dropped like a sack of flour, dead before she hit the ground. I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget the way the blood leaked into the inside of her eye. Before she died, I watched it turn red. I watched it happen and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a single thing I could do to help. We warn people not to go anywhere near them, but there&amp;rsquo;s always at least one idiot who does. And even if nothing happens to them, something bad always happens. Kids go missing as we&amp;rsquo;re on their trail. Someone dies the next day, cut in half in a completely safe part of the park. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but something bad always happens. I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly why they’re out here, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. They&amp;rsquo;re here, and if we were smart, we&amp;rsquo;d tell our new officers exactly what they&amp;rsquo;re capable of.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were both quiet for a little while. I was afraid to talk because I wasn’t sure if he was done. He looked like he wanted to say something else. Finally, he spoke up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you ever noticed how you can&amp;rsquo;t find the same ones twice?&amp;rdquo; I nodded, expecting him to continue. But he just stayed quiet, walking alongside me, and eventually he started a story about the biggest deer he’d ever seen in the park. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bring up the subject again, and I didn’t press him for any more stories. He dropped out of the op the next day. Apparently he left before the sun came up; he said he was sick. None of us have heard from him since he left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to stop here for the time being. I&amp;rsquo;ll try and post the next part in the coming days, but what with it being the end of summer, things are pretty busy here. Thanks for the continued interest, guys, you’ve really awakened this curiosity in me that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I had!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Who the hell are you?” I asked, backing up from the woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please,” she begged, grabbing at my arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smell from her was more unbearable up close. “Get off me, you old hag!” I yelled, pulling myself free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shushed me loudly. Her eyes appeared wide, scanning the area with paranoia. “You want them to hear?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who will hear? What are you talking about?” I asked harshly. It had only been a few minutes with her and I was already beginning to become irritated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Them!&lt;/em&gt;” she hissed. I could see the whites of her eyes gleam in the moonlight at her weak attempt to scare me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook my head unmoved. “I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for this. I’m really tired and I’ve got to get up early. Honestly, I don’t care what you do out here, but just stay away from my car. I don’t want to catch you near it again or else I’ll report you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, please don’t,” she begged, ready to grab at me again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I was able to avoid her clawing hands this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fine,” I shot back. “Just don’t touch me again. I’m leaving now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I turned to leave, I could see the woman’s head sulk to the ground. Normally, this would have been the part where I felt sorry, but right now I didn’t care. I was too tired with my mind overwhelmed with the events that had transpired throughout the day. Besides, she was clearly deranged in the head, possibly homeless, or maybe one of those people who lived off the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to walk away when it hit me. I thought about what she had said earlier. I looked back to still see her eyeing the ground, almost appearing in a trance. I was reluctant to go back, but I had to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What did you mean your daughter? And how did you know about the book?” I asked, approaching her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without looking up, she answered, “My daughter, I need your help to save her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your daughter? Who’s your daughter?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You already know of her, why do you ask me?” she replied, looking up at me. Her eyes relayed a look of solemn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I need to hear it from you,” I said. I was sure I knew the answer as she mentioned, but something inside me wanted to hear those words come from her. I wanted to be absolutely sure. “Say her name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why it’s Victoria, of course,” she said softly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook my head in disbelief. “But how? You’re her mother but…You’re supposed to be…. She said you &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt; when she was just a child.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is that what she was told you?” she scoffed. “It would be like Gary to tell her such a lie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” she said stiffly. “He &lt;em&gt;took&lt;/em&gt; her from me. When I didn’t want to submit to his religion, he banished me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This couldn&amp;rsquo;t be possible. Victoria&amp;rsquo;s mother was dead, right? But how would I know otherwise? I did notice, when I listened closely, I could hear her accent hidden behind her raspy voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait, this man you’re talking about,” I started. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been the same person. “Do you mean the reverend?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn’t answer me immediately. Instead, her eyes wandered off into the trees beyond, but eventually her head gave a soft nod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed. “Look, you said to help your daughter and that the reverend &amp;rsquo;took&amp;rsquo; her. Why didn’t you just go to the police or something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She chuckled to herself lightly, returning her eyes to mine. “You don’t know these people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know anything because you’re not telling me everything,” I replied harshly. My impatience had elevated to annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All you need to know is that the people you think you know, are liars. The Reverend is the worst of them all. They &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; my daughter; they made her a part of their revolting ritual. I should have never brought her here. I was so weak-minded back then. Damn them,” she spat bitterly. “I didn’t know what to do, but then, then I saw you arrive. At first, I was unsure what to think of you. Yet, while watching you with Victoria, I knew it would be &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; who would help me, to do what I couldn’t and take her away from all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started to come together. All those times, it felt like something or someone was watching me had been her. Yet, I was still confused. She hadn’t really answered my question and only contributed to the pile of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That&amp;rsquo;s a lot to believe, especially about the others. They don’t act the way you make them out to be. Besides, what ritual are you talking about?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re very fond of her, aren’t you?” she asked ignoring my question. “Of Victoria?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” I blurted out. I could feel my cheeks reddening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m glad that you are,” she said, smiling. “It does my heart good to see another care for Victoria as I do. This is the reason why I knew you’d help me, but I had to show you first, of what they plan to do and what they have already &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;. I left that book in your room as proof. You saw it, so you now know too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thrown-off again. I couldn’t believe she was behind the placement of the book as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait a second! I don’t even know what I saw in that book. I couldn’t even read the words.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need the words, you saw the pictures, didn’t you?!” she shot back. “What you saw has been done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what to think. The images on those pages were indeed horrific. I wanted to believe, but another part didn’t want to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You mean to tell that what’s growing in Victoria is…” I couldn’t finish the words. “What can you expect from &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; then? It seems a bit&amp;hellip; too late now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is one thing we can do,” she brought up. “I can dispel their ritual, stop it before it is ever completed and that evil is born.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why haven’t you done it already?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because…” she began. “I need access to their room of worship and last I check I lost my key.” She held up her hand for me to see. I could make out a small stump where her ring finger used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the hell?” I stammered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rings are more than show. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you know that by now. They are keys, but there is a darker secret behind them. They are also a symbol to show your the allegiance to the faith by permanently clamping onto the wearer’s finger. The only way to remove it is by removing the finger entirely. When they banished me, I was so torn that I &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; off my own finger. I didn’t want anything on me that was associated with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“T-that’s crazy,” was all I could say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t fathom someone wanting to risk their finger or any part of their body on the basis of their faith or anything. I’ve heard of tattoos, but this was way beyond that. I couldn’t help but picture the woman clamping down on her finger until it snapped and spitting it out. The very thought made my stomach churn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, but it was only after so, that I wished that I hadn’t. I could’ve ended this nightmare &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; ago. Yet, I let my anger cloud my judgment. But &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; here now which means there is hope again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Me?” I replied. “I don’t have a ring either though.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know, but the others do,” she said, smiling. “Do you know Terrance?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gritted my teeth. “How could I not? The prick,” I muttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Terrance is a lapdog when it comes to the reverend and the faith, but he’s too much of a pansy to wear the ring like the others. He keeps his on a necklace he wears,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen it,” I replied, recalling the times at dinner. “How am I supposed to get it, if it’s on him?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is where you come in perfectly. You probably don’t see much of everyone throughout the day; that’s because there are chores to be done to keep the place up and running. Terrance is a working man. He normally chops up wood or fetches game for the meals. When he bathes afterwards, he takes off the necklace. I know this because I used to do the sheets around the living quarters and would see his ring just lying there. That is best time to do it, for he never locks his door at that time either. If you can take his ring at that moment, bring it to me and I’ll do the rest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bit my lip, thinking on it. “I don’t know. It seems a bit risky. If I get caught, I’m finished and he’ll have me sent me home instantly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then don’t get caught. You’re the only one who can walk around easily. If I could do it, I would, but they’d see me on first sight. I was barely able to place the book in your room,” she brought up. “Please, you have to do this, for Victoria?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave off another long sigh before conceding. With that, a smile formed wider than it ever had on her face. I could see the many crooked rows of her blackened and yellow teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good,” she said, leaning close to me. “I’ve been watching Terrance for a while. He’s already chopped off a round of logs good for now, but he’ll need to do so again. He does it every two days. So the day after tomorrow you’ll have to make your move.” As she explained I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once I get it, how will I contact at you? Where will I find you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She paused for a moment before answering, “Your lamp. If you’re able to get the ring, then turn your lamp on and leave it on. I’m always watching, so I’ll see it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded. “Then what?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then bring the ring down to me and I’ll conduct my ceremony in the room. At that time, I want you to get Victoria out of here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait, what about you?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be fine. I’ve survived this long, so don’t worry about me,” she answered. “You should go now; we don’t want anyone catching wind of you out here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, right,” I agreed, turning to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s one more thing I need you to do,” the old woman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is it?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I need you to promise to never mention this meeting to Victoria. She must never know you’ve seen me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?&amp;rdquo; I said in bewilderment. &amp;ldquo;But Victoria would be thrilled to know that you’re alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know she would, which is why she cannot know that I am or else she will not want to leave. Now can you do that for me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard her voice quiver off. Her eyes became glossy in the moonlight. I swallowed hard and nodded. She returned a grateful nod and faded until I could no longer see her among the shadows. I shivered a little. The chill of the wind was finally getting to me. So, I quickly ran back inside and back up to my room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, I started the day early as usual for my work. Throughout it, I thought about the plan. Regardless of how I felt, I knew I had to make it work. I also knew I had to stall the overall progress of my work. So I made sure to inform Terrance that I would need a few extra days to complete it. My boss didn’t pick up when I called, so I left him the message. I made up a b.s. excuse about needing more time to set up and ensure the system was functioning correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I proceeded to head to my room to take a nap. Normally, I would’ve spent this time with Victoria. When I unlocked my door, I heard a grunting sound. The noise was subtle at first and appeared to be coming from the end of the hallway. I paused for a moment unsure if I had actually heard something. I was ready to shrug it off until I heard it again, but a little louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious, I made my way down the hallway, listening as I did. I stopped at the door I presumed it came from and pressed my ear up against it. I heard it again. I took my ear away; this was Victoria’s door. Hesitant, I knocked on it lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey are you alright in there?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Victoria? It’s me, Marcus,” I continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear rapid breathing from inside sounding almost like hyperventilating. It didn’t sound good. Frantic, I knocked on the door with a little more force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Victoria, are you alright? What’s going on in there?” I asked urgently. “Can you let me in, please?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Go away,” I heard her say in between gasps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed, pressing my head softly up against the door. “Look, I understand you don’t want to talk to me,” I began. “And I don’t blame you. I had no right to… I was a jerk back there and I shouldn’t have been prying as I did. In truth, I don’t care about the baby or who the father is. I never did. I just wanted you to know that I…” The words again failed me. I could see them in my mind, but I couldn’t push them out. “… I’m sorry,” I forced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to tell her something else, about how I felt about her, about everything, but the timing didn’t feel right. I turned to leave, but stopped when I heard the door open behind me. She had it half-cocked to allow her face to peer through. She stared at me for a moment as if analyzing my eyes for truth. Finally, she opened it fully, walking back into her room. I followed her, closing the door behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her room was nice. Unlike mine which was bland and almost empty, her room was more “cozy”. She had a desk filled with books, some open journals, others maybe novels. Her mini dresser was complimented with a vase filled with several flowers clearly well-cared for. The scent of her perfumed lingered in the air; I embraced its smell, a scent I longed missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What was the noise I heard earlier?&amp;rdquo; I asked. &amp;ldquo;I thought something was wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She walked over to the bed and sat, making a painful face as she did. “I’m fine,” she said gravely. “It’s just this bloody baby is all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined her on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I meant what I said out there,&amp;quot; I began. &amp;ldquo;I don’t care about it. You don’t have to tell me about it at all either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She kept her gaze way from me, but I could see tears forming in her eyes. “Just shut-up, Marcus,” she said with a quivering lip. “Just&amp;hellip; shut it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She broke down in tears cupping her face with her hands. I was bad at handling these kinds of moments. They always left me feeling awkward, but I gradually reached over to her shoulder to comfort her. She immediately threw herself on me, bawling her eyes out on my chest. After a good solid five minutes, she had finally stopped. Her eyes were reddened and her nose slightly runny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You said your mother died when you were young,&amp;rdquo; she finally said. &amp;ldquo;How did she die?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed. &amp;ldquo;She was killed,” I answered after a long pause. “Some guy broke into their apartment and shot her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marcus&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; she said softly. “I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry. That must have been devastating for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, well I don&amp;rsquo;t remember when it happened. Like I said, I was too young.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could feel her sob a little more on my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was my father,” she finally said, leaning on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Father?” I repeated, confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, he did this to me,” she said, looking down at her stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes widened as I pulled away. “Your father did this? Who is he?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who do you think?” she said, harshly wiping her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about it for a second and immediately my eyes flashed. “The reverend? Wait the reverend is your father?” I asked. I couldn’t believe it. Her mother said he took Victoria from her, but mentioned nothing of him &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; the father as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victoria nodded, but then shook her head. “Well he’s my &lt;em&gt;step&lt;/em&gt;-father. My mother met him after my real father died.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If he did this, why didn’t you tell anyone?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because I could not prove it; he drugged me or something, I don’t know. At first, I did not want to say anything, but when I started showing signs of the baby, he went on to tell everyone that it was a miracle, that it was a gift from &lt;em&gt;Lanius&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; she explained. &amp;ldquo;And like aimless sheep, they questioned nothing, taking in his poisoned words. But I knew the truth, because he was the only one else there.&amp;rdquo; A few more tears fell down her cheek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bit my lip when she said this. This part sounded all too familiar. I thought about the book and the image of the man standing with the woman, and that horrid figure behind her. Was it all true though? She had no memory of the event. Was it possible that this sick action was all just the reverend’s doing? Regardless of which, Victoria’s mother was right, these people were monsters, if not that, ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I wanted to cheer her up. I thought about telling her everything about her mother, but remembered the promise I made. Instead, I lifted her chin up so that her eyes were looking into my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can take you away from all off this. All we have to do is jump in my car and leave. You’ll never have to see this place again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see a mixture between happiness and fear in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But how? Where would we go?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can stay with me. I have my own place. It’s safe, trust me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marcus…?” she spoke softly. A smile gradually formed on her lips. “Yes, let’s do it,” she said, rendering me a tight hug. “We should leave tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tonight?” I repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, after dinner. Any earlier and they’ll become suspicious. They always hold their sermons late at night which gives us enough time between then. We can leave then.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked away, trying to find a way to convey my thoughts. I didn’t want to reveal the plan or her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong, Marcus?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Err, how about tomorrow night?” I suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tomorrow? Why? Why do we have to stay here another day? Let’s leave tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, it has to be tomorrow night,” I quickly shot back without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marcus, I don’t understand. Is there something you’re not telling me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I placed my hands on her shoulders firmly looking her in the eyes. “Look, you have to trust me. I have a plan with… a friend. They’re willing to help, but it has to be tomorrow, okay?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes were full of so much confusion. I knew she thirsted for answers, but luckily she simply nodded. “Okay, I trust you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second, we began to lean in for a kiss when we were both startled by an abrupt knocking at the door. I answered it to discover Sophia on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Pale?” she said surprisingly. “We were beginning to worry about you when we didn’t find ya&amp;rsquo; in yer&amp;rsquo; workspace.” Her eyes shifted their gaze between me and Victoria. “I trust I wasn’t interruptin&amp;rsquo; anything?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said, trying to maintain my composure. “I was just&amp;hellip; checking on Victoria.” I turned back to give her a wave and slid past Sophia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading down, I glanced down the hall to still see her in Victoria’s doorway. I didn’t want to arouse suspicion so I continued on and back to the room I was working in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad I had patched things up with Victoria. The feeling helped ease my thoughts on the plan. I wondered if we could really pull it off. Leaving the place was one thing, but stealing the ring from that jerk was another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something broke this mood, though. I was heading back to continue my work when I caught sight of Terrance walking outside with an ax over his shoulder. That was strange. There was probably nothing to worry about; the old woman said he chopped every &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; days. He would still need to do it tomorrow. He probably needed it for something else I assured myself. Though the thought wasn’t that very reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to keep my eye on him while I worked just in case. I looked towards the trees hoping to maybe catch sight of the old woman, but didn’t see anything. I didn’t actually believe I would see her since she had been able to keep herself invisible for years. I was sure though that she too was watching everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued working until Sophia came to me. She informed me that my boss had called and was waiting on the phone. Great, perfect timing as always, I thought grumpily. What did he want anyway? She led me back to the phone where I found it sitting off the hook on its side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, he was following up on the message I left and wanted to ensure I was making progress. I told him that I would have everything up soon, hoping to end the phone call quickly. I noticed the small window in the room and peered out it, stretching the phone line as I did. I gazed out and to my horror I saw Terrance making his way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shirt was fully soaked in sweat while he was pushing a wheel-barrow full of chopped logs. After dumping the logs off, he made his way around to the front. I felt my heart leap into my throat. In my ear, I could hear my boss go on into another one of his speeches about representing the company. Fuck the company right now, I thought. I had a small window of opportunity and I was about to miss it. We were completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could already hear Terrance slam the front door and proceed to the stairs. I quickly thought of a way to let my boss allow me to hang up, lying that one of the clients had asked for my help. Once over, I raced out the room nearly smacking into Margaret on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Goodness, me! You’re running as if a fire spurred!” she exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologized frantically, my eyes looking down the hallway behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is everything alright, dear?” she asked with a puzzled look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” I lied. “I just need to&amp;ndash;use to the bathroom &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, I shouldn’t keep you,” she replied, holding a hand up to her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thanked her and raced towards the stairs, stopping immediately before reaching the top. I cautiously peeked down the hallway. No one was in sight. Where was he? Was he still in his room or did he already enter the bathroom? I crept up the last remaining steps slowly, eventually making my way down the hall. I could hear the sound of water running in the background. Yes, he was in the shower, but for how long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing I didn’t have much time, I sped up my pace until I reached his door. I opened it quickly, shutting it behind me. Surprisingly, his room was a lot like mine. There wasn’t much in it; it was bland and almost empty. Anything he did have like books were nicely organized in its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began looking around making sure to return anything I moved back to its original place. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. Every sound I heard, whether creak or thump, I associated it with it being Terrance. It felt like my senses had amplified. I found myself constantly looking towards the door in paranoia, thinking he’d could barge through at any minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked through his dresser and all around his bookcase, but found nothing. I started searching the desk, pulling open drawers to see inside. When I opened that last drawer, I froze. Inside I could make-out a familiar object: a gun. It was a revolver; I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the specifics, but it had a very long barrel. I could see the dust that had formed over it; clearly, it hadn’t been touched in a while. I shut the drawer and continued searching around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I couldn’t believe it, the ring wasn’t here. How could that be? I wanted to check over everything again, but a feeling inside urged me to leave. I listened to it and left the room gently closing its door behind me. I started to head back to my room until I heard a voice call out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oy!” I heard, freezing my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost shouted in complete terror out of the shock. I turned to see a half-robed Terrance dripping in the hallway. A towel was wrapped around his waist soaking up what little water dripped from his wet body. His sweaty clothes were tightly gripped in a ball in one hand while the other held his shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are doing down here?” he asked sternly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart was now knocking against my chest as if wanting to burst out. “I just needed to use the bathroom,” I lied. “I didn’t realize someone was in it until I got down the hall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrance squinted hard at me as if trying to figure me out, but finally gestured to the bathroom with his head. “Well, it’s free now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thanked him and made my way past him. I pushed open the door to the small bathroom and immediately my eyes lit up. There sitting on the sink was the necklace with the ring attached. He had it with him all along. I was close to reaching for it until I heard someone behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s the blasted thing,” Terrance said, moving past me and grabbing it. “It’s all yer for real now,” he said and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t believe it. The plan had failed. I wanted to punch a wall or something, even scream out-loud. Yet when I really thought about it, there was no chance of getting away with it freely. Even if he had left it in his room, he would have immediately noticed. There wouldn’t have been enough time to give it the old woman and leave with Victoria, especially if we planned to leave in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed and began my long walk of defeat back. What could I tell the old woman now? We didn’t have an alternate plan. I continued, heading downstairs and decided to get back to work. Maybe I could think of something while I did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner eventually came by and still I had no idea what to do. I was sure the old woman had seen my lamp was still off to relay the failure of the plan. I wondered if she would possibly come-up with a solution of her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Marcus, how far along are you with your work?&amp;quot; Margaret inquired, pulling me from my thoughts. &amp;ldquo;I heard there were minor delays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I should have everything up and running by tomorrow,” I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh there’s a dreadful thought. We’re going to miss having you around. You’re almost like a member of the family now,” she said, giving off an unsettling giggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve actually been meaning to ask why you needed this service anyway. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like you really need it,&amp;rdquo; I brought up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On the contrary, my boy,&amp;rdquo; the reverend spoke. &amp;ldquo;Our faith is a rare breed, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there aren&amp;rsquo;t any other inspirin&amp;rsquo; souls out there. We wanna be able to reach any and all potential followers. With your help, we can do that and upload our sermons for all to see.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh okay,&amp;rdquo; I said weakly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mere thought of them uploading footage of them worshiping made me feel uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Plus, it brought ya&amp;rsquo; to us, Marcus. Havin&amp;rsquo; a young lad such as yerself has truly been a pleasure,&amp;rdquo; he continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled sheepishly and glanced over to Victoria. She appeared to be squinting in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you alright, my dear?” Margaret asked when she caught sight of this too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victoria appeared to be suppressing the pain. “Yes,” she answered. “I think I just need to lie down for the evening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you need any help?” Sophia offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, I’ll be fine. Please, there is no need to worry about me,” she said, excusing herself from the table. “I just need to rest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see her gripping her stomach as she did. I wanted to leave the table as well, but my legs remained frozen, numb to the commands from my brain. I just sat there watching her leave. For some reason, I could not shake the feeling of discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, I made my way back to my room. In the hallway, I glanced down towards Victoria’s door. What were we going to now? The plan had failed and tomorrow was the day I promised would be our last here. I entered my room almost slamming it shut. I could feel tears of anger growing in my eyes. Why did it all have to go to hell? Why did that bastard have to ruin everything? And why, why did I have to fuck it up so badly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must’ve have eventually passed out from my rage-fit because I was soon awakened by the sound of voices and footsteps. The footsteps sounded urgent rushing from one end of the hallway to the next. Without warning, a blood-curdling wail filled the air. It grew so loud that I had to put my hands over my ears. It sounded like a woman’s voice: Victoria’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I raced to my door ready to rip it open, but immediately I stopped myself. I could hear a sound worse than her wail; it was so eerie and frightening that it sent an icy chill down my spine. What I heard was the low chanting of voices. They spoke in unison, reciting words I couldn’t comprehend. I could see a dim light flicker across the door’s bottom crack. While it did, I could hear Victoria’s moans of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices grew louder, passing by my door eventually fading into the distance. I cracked open my door to look out which let out its signature creak. I was sure it would alert them, and halted it in mid-swing. I could see the hallway was still quiet. I opened the door fully, taking a step outside. It was dark and absent of light. Under my shoe, I felt something wet. I took out my phone and used the backlight to get a better view. It was some kind of liquid, maybe water? I was ready to believe this thought until I accidentally dropped my phone &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; it. I quickly grabbed it in a panic, wiping it off, but the liquid seemed to only smear. I took my phone back into my room to see it better in the light. It wasn’t water, it was blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped at the realization of this. I went back in the hallway using my phone’s light again over the liquid. I could make out more of it leading to the stairs. The other end of the hallway showed the trail lead back to Victoria’s room which had its light on. I swallowed hard and walked towards it trying to mentally prepare myself for the worse. I reached it and slowly edged my way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was blood everywhere. A trail of it ran from the door up to her bed. The sheets were completely doused in red. I could smell her perfume mixed with smoke and the metallic smell of blood. I felt my stomach give-in at the sight. Immediately, I vomited all that I had eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt my knees weaken and give away as well, falling to the ground and dropping my phone in the process. I must have blackened out for a few seconds before regaining awareness. When I regained consciousness, I noticed my phone’s backlight about to turn to black. I quickly got up, horrified that I had been laying next to &lt;em&gt;blood&lt;/em&gt;. What had happened in here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my phone and glanced at the bed. A puddle of red soaked the lower half of the sheets. However, I noticed there was another spot, much smaller, forming near her pillow. I slowly reached for it unsure what I was about to see. I couldn’t imagine anything worse, but I was wrong. To my dismay, I found a finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clearly cut-off with the tip of its bone sticking out of the red covered flesh. It appeared to be Victoria’s, it had to have been. Next to the finger was a small knife with its tip covered in blood. Why did she cut it off? I observed the finger closer and realized the ring doused in red. She had cut off her finger so that I would have it; the key to the Congregation room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She must’ve done so out of desperation. I thought about the pain she had shown from her contractions at dinner. She must’ve felt it was time for the child. Those sick bastards were going through with their ritual. They didn’t care about Victoria; the old woman was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to do something. I promised her that I would get her out of here and I was going to keep it. I hesitantly picked up the finger; it was still warm, and placed it in my pocket with care. Racing out of the room, I came to a stop when I remembered the gun kept by Terrance. It was something I was probably going to need. His door was locked when I tried to open it, but I didn’t care. I didn’t have time to waste, and began kicking it until the handle caved-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pushed it open, running to the desk drawer where I had last seen the gun. I opened it and smiled; it was still there. I grabbed it feeling its weight fall into my hand. With my thumb, I popped its wheel open to reveal six bullets lined in their chambers. Perfect, I thought and tucked it in the back of my pants and then ran out the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to the bottom of the stairs and noticed that the lobby was dark, the scent of candles in the air. The trail of blood from earlier could be seen leading to the Congregation room. I pressed my ear up against the double-doors to listen. It was silent - no voices or wails from Victoria. Something wasn’t right. I tried the handle only to find it locked as it always was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached into my pocket, pulling out the finger. I checked for the small indent on the door, placed it up against it, and twisted it to the right the way I remembered Victoria doing so. Instantly, there was a soft click from the door. I pulled at the handle again and could feel the door move. This was it. I placed the finger back in my pocket and peeked through the small crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I could see was darkness. I opened the door wider and was met with a warm breeze to my face. With it opened, I could see a dim light flickering from the sides. I poked my head in first before completely entering. The light was coming from the candles mounted on columns near the walls. With it, I could make out the room even more than I had the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire area looked older in the light. The walls appeared worn-out and decayed almost blackened as if burned. The columns appeared ancient in nature broiled with cracks and fungus throughout. A deep scent of ash and moisture filled the air. I could now see the seating hues were carved from stone similar to the columns. A few were split in areas almost falling apart. The place looked like it had been there for centuries. The building must have been built around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the corner of my eye, I caught sight of a dark figure off to the side. The candle light flickered across it producing a vague outline of it. I swallowed hard, peering towards the thing with frightened eyes. Something was there, and it was watching me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello?” I called out softly to it. I could feel every hair standing up on my neck. “Hello?” I said again, my voice quivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure gave no answer in return. I slowly walked to it, watching as the light flickered across it. With the distance closing between us, I could see its pale face in the light. My heart plummeted. Empty black holes were present where its eyes were supposed to be. The mouth of it was gaped wide open, almost like it was screaming in terror, but no noise came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ready to bolt out of there until I noticed that it did nothing, it didn’t even move. Cautiously, I approached the figure with my hand stretched out. I eased cautiously, half-expecting it to lash out at me at any moment. Finally, I touched its surface. When I did, I took a deep sigh of relief. It was only a mask. I picked it up revealing its disturbing features even more up close. I looked back at the wall to see the figure was in fact a black cloak of some kind. I pulled it off, releasing it from the hook, and brought both objects into the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cloak and mask alright, thank goodness. Was this what they wore for their ceremonies? I looked back at the wall to see several other empty hooks lined up. Glancing back at the cloak, I noticed a faded image running across it. It was a symbol, but not like the one on the door. I recognized this one though: it was an inverted cross. It had chains attached as well, hanging from its waistline. It must&amp;rsquo;ve been Victoria&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without warning, I was startled by the faint echo of a woman’s wails. It was coming from further back in the room. I followed the noise which brought me up to the altar. At the top, I could make out a familiar sight behind the podium. It was the statue from before, still horrid to the eyes as ever. As I climbed the stairs, the image of the statue became more apparent. It still brought an eerie feeling to me, right down to my bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t stand the sight of it and looked away as I passed it. Behind it, I saw the mouth of a cave. Reaching it, I could see it stretch deep down into the darkness. It was dimly lit by a few candles mounted on its walls. Stone steps descended with it. I could feel a warm breeze flowing from it like the breath of a large beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every so often, a wail would echo from its depths sending my heart into its own depths with it. This was crazy. How could all of this be in here? It was clear that this, that all of it, was &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; over my head. I wanted to turn around, God knows I wanted to, but with each wail I thought of Victoria. I couldn’t leave her to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glanced down at my hands to discover that I was still holding the cloak and the mask. It was a long shot, but I thought if I wore it, it would help me blend in. Even if it bought me only a few minutes, I could use whatever edge I could get. I threw on the cloak and placed the mask over my face. I took one last breath and began making my descent.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a comment in the last post that made me remember an event from my childhood that I always took as odd but never considered it to be related to any of these stories. I know now that it is. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how memories work. The details might all be present in your mind, though scattered and disarrayed, and then a single thought can stitch them back together almost instantly. I never thought of these events much because I was focused on the wrong details. I went back to my mom&amp;rsquo;s house and went through my old childhood school work looking for something that I think is important. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it, but I&amp;rsquo;ll keep looking. Again, sorry for the length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most old cities and the neighborhoods in them weren&amp;rsquo;t planned with the thought that the population would begin to grow exponentially and it would have to be accommodated. The layout of the roads is generally originally in response to geographical restrictions and the necessity of connecting points of economic importance. Once the connecting roads are established, new businesses and roads are positioned strategically along the existing skeleton, and eventually the paths carved into the earth are immortalized in asphalt, leaving room only for minor modifications, additions, and alterations, but never a dramatic change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My childhood neighborhood must have been old, then. If straight lines move &amp;ldquo;as the crow flies&amp;rdquo;, then my neighborhood must have been built based on the travels of a snake. The first houses built must have been placed around the lake and gradually the inhabitable area increased as new extensions were built off the original path, but these new extensions all ended abruptly at one point or another&amp;mdash;there was only one entrance/exit for the entire neighborhood. Many of these extensions were limited by a tributary which both fed and drank from the lake and passed right by what I came to call (and have called in these stories) &amp;ldquo;the ditch&amp;rdquo;. Many of the original homes had enormous yards, but some of those original plots had been divided, leaving properties with smaller and smaller boundaries. An aerial view of my neighborhood would give one the impression that an enormous squid had once died in the woods and some adventuring entrepreneur found the corpse and paved roads over its tentacles, only to withdraw his involvement and leave time, greed, and desperation to divide up the land among prospective home-owners like an embarrassing attempt at the Golden Ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my porch you could see the old houses that surrounded the lake, but the house of Mrs. Maggie was my favorite. She was, as best as I can remember, around eighty years old, but despite that she was one of the friendliest people I had ever met. She had a head of loose-set, white curls and always wore light dresses with floral patterns. She would talk to me and Josh from her back porch when we were swimming in the lake, and she would always invite us in for snacks. She said that she was lonely because her husband Tom was always away on business, but Josh and I would always decline her invitation because, as nice as Mrs. Maggie was, there was still something a bit odd about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and then when we would swim away she would say, &amp;ldquo;Chris and John, you&amp;rsquo;re welcome here anytime!&amp;rdquo; And we could hear her still yelling that when we were walking back into my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Maggie, like many of the older home-owners, had a sprinkler system that was on a timer, though at some point over the years her timer must have broken because the sprinklers would come on at various points during the day and often even at night all year. While it never got cold enough to snow very much, several times each winter I would go outside in the morning to see Mrs. Maggie&amp;rsquo;s yard transformed into a surreal arctic paradise by the frozen water. Every other yard stood sterilized and dry by the biting frost of the winter&amp;rsquo;s cold, but right there in the middle of the bleak reminder of the savagery of the season was an oasis of beautiful ice hanging like stalactites from every branch of every tree and every leaf of every bush. As the sun rose, it reflected off and each piece of ice splintered the sun into a rainbow that would only be viewed briefly before it blinded you. Even as a child I was struck by how beautiful it was, and often Josh and I would go over there to walk on the iced grass and have sword fights with the icicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once asked my mom why she left it on like that. My mom seemed to search for the explanation before she said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, Sweetie, Mrs. Maggie is sick a lot, and sometimes when she gets really sick, she gets confused. That&amp;rsquo;s why she messes up yours and Josh&amp;rsquo;s names sometimes. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean to, but sometimes she just can&amp;rsquo;t remember. She lives in that big house all by herself so it&amp;rsquo;s ok if you talk to her when you swim in the lake, but when she invites you in you should keep saying &amp;rsquo;no&amp;rsquo;. Be polite; her feelings won&amp;rsquo;t get hurt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But she&amp;rsquo;ll be less lonely when her husband comes home though, right? How long will he be away on business? It seems like he&amp;rsquo;s always away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom seemed to struggle and I could see that she had become very upset. Finally she answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Honey&amp;hellip; Tom&amp;rsquo;s not going to come home. Tom&amp;rsquo;s in heaven. He died years and years ago, but Mrs. Maggie doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember. She gets confused and forgets, but Tom&amp;rsquo;s not ever coming home. If someone moved back in with her she might even think it was Tom, but he&amp;rsquo;s gone, Sweetie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have only been around five or six when she told me that, and while I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it completely, I was still profoundly sad for Mrs. Maggie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know now that Mrs. Maggie had Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. She and her husband Tom had had two sons: Chris and John. The two had worked out payment plans with the utility companies and paid for Mrs. Maggie&amp;rsquo;s water and electricity, but they would never visit her. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if something happened between them, or if it was the illness, or if they just lived too far away, but they never came around. I have no idea what they looked like, but there were times when Mrs. Maggie must have thought Josh and I looked like they did when they were children. Or maybe she saw what some part of her mind so desperately wanted her to see; ignoring the images transmitted down her optic nerve and just for a little while showing her what used to be. I realize only now how lonely she must have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the summer after Kindergarten, before the events of &amp;ldquo;Balloons&amp;rdquo;, Josh and I had taken to exploring the woods near my house, as well as the tributary of the lake. We knew that the woods between our houses were connected, and we thought it would be neat if the lake near my house was somehow connected to the creek around his, so we resolved ourselves to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going to make maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was to make two separate maps and then combine them. We would make one map exploring the area around the creek near his house, and make another following the outflow from my lake. Originally, we were going to make one map, but we realized that wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible since I had started drawing the map of my area so huge that the route from his house wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been to scale. We kept the map from the lake at my house and the map from the creek at his house, and we would add to each when we stayed the night with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first couple weeks it went really well. We would walk through the woods along the water and pause every couple minutes to add to the map, and it seemed like the two maps would come together any day. We had no equipment needed for the job&amp;mdash;not even a compass&amp;mdash;but we tried to make due. We had the idea to impale the earth with a stick when we had reached the end of a venture so that if we came upon the stick from the other direction the next weekend, we would know we had joined the maps. We might have been the world&amp;rsquo;s worst cartographers. Eventually, however, the woods became too thick near the water coming from the lake and we were unable to proceed further. We lost interest in the whole project for a bit, and reduced our explorations significantly&amp;mdash;though not completely&amp;mdash;when we started selling snow cones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I showed my mom all the pictures I had taken home from school and she took away my snow cone machine, our interest in the maps revitalized. We had to come up with another plan. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand why, my mom had placed what I considered to be extremely severe restrictions on what I could do and where I could go, and I had to check in frequently if I went outside to play with Josh. This meant that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t stay in the woods for hours and continue to look for a new path. We thought that we could just swim when we got to the cutoff in the woods, but that clearly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work since the map would get wet. We tried going faster when we were coming from Josh&amp;rsquo;s house, but we eventually ran into the same problem. Then we had a brilliant idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d build a raft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the construction in the neighborhood, there was a large amount of scrap building material that the company would set in the ditch to keep it out of the road and offsite since they no longer needed it for building. We originally conceived of a formidable ship complete with a mast and an anchor, but this quickly diminished into something more manageable. We set aside the wood and took several large pieces of Styrofoam that were backed with foam board and tied them together with rope and kite string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched our vessel a little down water from Mrs. Maggie and waved a farewell to her as she motioned us to come back her way. But there was no stopping us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raft worked very well, and while we both behaved and spoke as if the functionality of the raft was a given, I know at least I was a little surprised. We each had a fairly long tree branch to use as a paddle, but we found it was easier to simply push against the land under the water than actually use them as intended. When the water became too deep we&amp;rsquo;d simply lie on our stomachs and use our hands to paddle the water, which still worked&amp;mdash;albeit less well. The first time we had to resort to that method of propulsion, I remember thinking that from far above it must have looked like a colossally fat man with tiny arms was out for a swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually took us several trips to get the raft to the impassable patch of woods that marked the farthest we had made it. After we had come up with the idea of marking the ground with the stick, we had taken to running through the woods until we got to the stick and then, as carefully and precisely as we knew how, charting our course. This meant that the impasse was actually quite a bit away, so to sail from around my house all the way to the blockade in the woods was taking longer than expected. We&amp;rsquo;d sail for a bit and then dock the raft, and then next time we&amp;rsquo;d run through the woods to the raft and go a little farther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued this well into first grade. Josh and I were assigned to different groups that year, so, since we didn&amp;rsquo;t really see one another during the school day, our parents were more willing to let us hang out all weekend each week. What&amp;rsquo;s more, Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad had taken on a lengthy construction job that required him to work over the weekends, and his mother was on-call, so this meant that Josh would stay at my house most every weekend for weeks on end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should have been making excellent progress, but when we finally made it to the impasse and had the opportunity to explore past it we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a place to dock the raft. The woods were simply too thick, and the water had eroded the land to the point that there was nearly a two-foot rise of earth over the tributary which exposed the twisting and damp roots of the trees above. We&amp;rsquo;d have to turn back every time and leave the raft at the same thick of trees that prompted us to build it in the first place. Even worse, winter had arrived, so we couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify leaving the house in our swimsuits; we were getting nowhere&amp;mdash;we always had to come home before we could gain much ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday, around 7 PM, Josh and I were playing when one of my mom&amp;rsquo;s coworkers knocked on our door. Her name was Samantha, and I remember her well now because I would propose to her a couple of years later when I was visiting my mom at work. My mom said that she had to go to work to fix a problem that had arisen and that she&amp;rsquo;d back in about two hours. Her car was being repaired, so she&amp;rsquo;d have to ride with Samantha, but I gathered that the problem was Samantha&amp;rsquo;s fault and discussing it in the car was why it would only take two hours. She said that under no circumstances were we to leave the house or open the door for anyone, and she was in the middle of explaining that she would call every hour when she got there to check in, but she ended that statement prematurely when she remembered that our phone had been turned off for delinquent payments – this was why Samantha had just come by unannounced. She looked me dead in the eye as she was closing the door and said &amp;ldquo;Stay put.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched her drive down the serpentine road toward the exit, and as soon as the car rounded the last visible bend we ran back to my room. I dumped my backpack out while Josh grabbed the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, do you have a flashlight?&amp;rdquo; Josh chimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, but we&amp;rsquo;ll be back way before dark.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was thinking just in case, we should have one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My mom has one, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know where she keeps it&amp;hellip; Wait!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into my closet and pulled a box down from the top shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have a flashlight in there?&amp;rdquo; Josh asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not exactly&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened the box and revealed three Roman candles that I had taken from the pile that my mother had amassed for the fourth of July that past summer; along with a lighter that I had managed to take from her some months before, this would ensure that we at least had some light if we needed it. This was a little bit before I had been given an opportunity to be afraid of the woods at night, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t fear that motivated our search for a light source&amp;mdash;only practicality. We threw it all in the backpack and bolted out the backdoor, making sure to close it so Boxes wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get out. We had one hour and fifty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran through the woods as fast as we could and made it to the raft in about fifteen minutes. We had our bathing suits on under our clothes, so we stripped off our shirts and shorts and left them in two separate piles about four feet from the edge of the water. We untied the raft from the tree, grabbed our branch-paddles, and cast off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to move rapidly to reach a point beyond the contents of our ever-expanding map, as we didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to waste seeing old sights. We knew that we were slower in the raft than on land, and that we would be in the raft for quite a while after the cutoff since the woods were too thick to walk through and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a place to dock; this meant that we&amp;rsquo;d have to ride the raft back to the original docking site even if we found a new place to dock it further ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we passed the last charted part of our map, the water began to get really deep and eventually we could no longer touch the bottom with our tree branches, so we lay on our stomachs and paddled with our hands. It was getting darker and, as a result, it was becoming harder to distinguish the trees from one another, and we were both becoming slightly unnerved. In the interest of making good time we were paddling fast with our arms, but this caused a lot of noise as our hands repeatedly confronted and then broke through the water&amp;rsquo;s surface tension. During these periods we could both hear the crunching of dead leaves and the snapping of fallen sticks in the woods to our right. As we would slow our pace and quiet our actions, the rustling in the woods would cease, and we began to wonder if it was really ever there at all. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know what kinds of animals resided this far into the woods, but we did know that we didn&amp;rsquo;t wish to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Josh amended the map that I was illuminating with the lighter we were suddenly confronted with the fact that the sounds were not imagined. Rapidly and rhythmically we heard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crunch.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snap.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Crunch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed to be moving slightly away from us, pushing through the woods just beyond our map. It had become too dark to see. We had misjudged how long the sun would linger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nervously, I called out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a brief moment of breathless tension as we lay static in the water. This silence was suddenly broken by laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Hello?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; Josh cackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Mr. Monster-in-the-woods. I know you&amp;rsquo;re sneaking around but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll answer to my &amp;lsquo;hello&amp;rsquo;? Hellooooooo!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized how stupid it was. Whatever animal it was, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t respond. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even realized I&amp;rsquo;d said it until afterwards, but if anything was actually there I obviously wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh continued, &amp;ldquo;Helloooooo,&amp;rdquo; in a high falsetto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Helloooo,&amp;rdquo; I countered with as deep a baritone as I could manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Ello there, mate!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hel-lo. Beep boop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;HhheeeEEELLLLOOOoooo.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued mocking each other, and were in the process of turning the raft around to head back when we heard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was whispered and forced as if it were powered by the last breath in a pair of deflating lungs, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t sound sickly. It had come from the spot just off the map, which now sat behind us since we had turned the raft around. I slowly shifted on the raft and faced the direction of the sound as I fumbled with the Roman candle. I wanted to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;re you doing?!&amp;rdquo; Josh hissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had already lit it. As the sparking fuse sunk into the wrapper I held it toward the sky. I had never actually shot one of these myself and thought to just use it like a flair in the movies. A glowing, green orb rocketed out toward the stars and then quickly extinguished. I lowered my arm more toward the horizon; I could remember that there were several colors, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember how many times one of these fired before being depleted. A second ball of red light burst out and fizzled above the trees, but I still saw nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s just go, man!&amp;rdquo; Josh pressed, as he turned to face the direction back home and began paddling desperately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just one more&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowering my arm directly at the woods in front of me, another red ball of fire was launched from the tube. It traveled straight ahead until it collided with a tree, briefly exploding the light in a much greater diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped the firework in the water and watched as one more struggling fireball burst free only to quickly die, suffocated by the water. As we began paddling in the direction toward my house we heard a loud and unconcealed rustling in the woods. The breaking of branches and the trampling of fallen leaves overpowered the sound of our splashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our panic we jostled the raft too violently and I felt one of the ropes under my chest loosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Josh, be careful!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was too late. Our raft was breaking. Before too long it had completely fallen apart. We each held on to a separate piece of Styrofoam, but the pieces weren&amp;rsquo;t big enough to keep us completely afloat, and our legs dangled beneath us in the winter water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Josh! Quick!&amp;rdquo; I yelled as I pointed at the water right next to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He scrambled, but it was too cold to move quickly and we both watched as the map floated away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m c-c-cold, m-man,&amp;rdquo; Josh shuddered, dejectedly. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;sss get out of the w-water.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We approached the shore, but each time we attempted to pull ourselves up we&amp;rsquo;d hear the frantic rustling thundering toward us from the woods just above. Eventually we were too cold and weak to even try anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steadily we kicked our legs and found ourselves nearing the dock site. We toppled off the debris and tried to pull it on land, but Josh&amp;rsquo;s piece slipped away and floated in the direction of the lake. We took off our swim suits and were desperate to get into dry clothes to shield us from the biting chill of the air. I slid my shorts, but there was something wrong. I turned to Josh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s my shirt, man?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shrugged and suggested, &amp;ldquo;Maybe it got knocked into the water and floated into the lake?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told Josh to go back to my house, and to say that we were playing hide and seek if my mom was home. I had to try to find my shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran behind the houses and peered out over the water and scouted along the shoreline. It occurred to me that with any luck, maybe I could find the map too. I was moving pretty fast because I needed to get home, and was about to give up when my concentration was interrupted by a sound coming from just behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I whipped around. It was Mrs. Maggie. I had never seen her at night before, and in this poor light, she looked exceedingly frail. The usual warmth that wrapped her manner seemed to have been snuffed out by the chill. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember ever seeing her without a smile, and so her face looked strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Mrs. Maggie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, hi Chris!&amp;rdquo; the warmth and smile had returned to her, even if her memories had not. &amp;ldquo;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it was you in the dark there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jokingly, I asked her if she was going to invite me in for a snack, but she said maybe another time; I was too busy looking for my map and the shirt to really engage her, but she sounded happy so I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel bad. She said a couple other things, but I was too distracted to pay attention. I said goodnight and ran down her driveway toward my house. Behind me I could hear her walking across the frozen yard, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t turn around to wave; I had to get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it home a couple minutes before my mom did, and by the time she came in Josh and I had already changed clothes and warmed up. We&amp;rsquo;d gotten away with it, even though we&amp;rsquo;d lost the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nah, but I saw Mrs. Maggie. She called me Chris again. I&amp;rsquo;m telling you dude, just be glad you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen her at night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both laughed and he asked me if she invited me in for a snack, joking that the snacks must be terrible since she couldn&amp;rsquo;t even give them away. I told him that she didn&amp;rsquo;t and he was surprised, and now that I had time to think about it so was I. Literally, every time we had seen her she had invited us in for snacks, and here I had, albeit sarcastically, invited myself, and she said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Josh talked more about Mrs. Maggie I suddenly realized that the lighter might still be in my pocket and that it would be disastrous for my mom to find. I grabbed the shorts off the floor and padded my pockets; I felt something, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the lighter. From my back pocket I slid out a folded piece of paper and my heart leapt. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The map?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I watched it float away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; As I unfolded the paper, my stomach turned as I tried to understand what I was seeing. Drawn on the paper inside of a large oval were two stick figures holding hands. One was much bigger than the other, but neither had faces. The paper was torn so a part of it was missing, and there was a number written near the top right corner. It was either &amp;ldquo;15&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;16&amp;rdquo;. I nervously handed Josh the paper and asked him if he had put it in my pocket at some point, but he scoffed at the idea and asked why I was so upset. I pointed toward the smaller stick figure and what was written next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my initials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook it off and told Josh the rest of the conversation between Mrs. Maggie and I. I had always attributed the odd exchange to her being sick until revisiting the events in my mind all these years later. As I think about it now, the feeling of profound sadness for Mrs. Maggie returns, but it is augmented by a looming feeling of despair when I think about why she said &amp;ldquo;maybe another time.&amp;rdquo; I knew what she had said, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what it meant that night. I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what her words had meant weeks later when I watched men in strange, orange bio-hazard suits carry what I thought were black bags full of garbage out of her house, or why the whole neighborhood smelled like death that day. I still didn&amp;rsquo;t understand when they condemned the house and boarded it up a little while before we moved. But I understand now. I understand why her last words to me were so important, even if neither she nor I realized it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Maggie had told me that night that Tom had come home, but I know now who had really moved in; just as I know now why I never saw her body brought out on a stretcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bags weren&amp;rsquo;t filled with garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should begin this entry by saying how truly sorry I am to anyone who read part 4. I had no idea that was going to happen. The agents have assured me that every trace of the story has been removed from the internet, and that there is nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were unfortunate enough to have read part 4: I beg you, for your own sake, try to forget everything. If you experience nose bleeds, dizziness, migraines, or hallucinations, go immediately to the emergency room. If you have a recurring dream of an island made of song, under no circumstances should you approach or attempt to open the blue door with the painting of a crow on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you did not read part 4: There was no part 4. It does not exist. Forget you ever heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, you probably already know that there is a shitty gas station at the edge of our small town, and that weird things have been happening there. The city council has personally asked me to stop talking about it, as there have been some astute readers that not only tracked down our small town from the brief descriptions I&amp;rsquo;ve given, but actually come and visited me at work. I heard that one of them has joined the Mathematists, and as far as I know the other two are still missing. Once again, I am sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not working right now. It&amp;rsquo;s the first legitimate break I&amp;rsquo;ve had since I first started writing my stories on receipt paper all that time ago. Time moves funny here. Flowing slow and fast all at once, like molasses out of a shotgun. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping a journal. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few moments before my laptop dies, and I think now would be the perfect time to transpose my journal entries, before the battery runs out or the blood loss gets me. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s a race to see what happens first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before any of you worry, I&amp;rsquo;ve already called Tom. He said he&amp;rsquo;s on his way here to give me a ride to the hospital, right after he picks up dinner for the Ledford orphans, John-Ben and Little Sister. Tom and the other deputies have been taking turns checking in on and bringing them food in an attempt to make the whole thing less tragic. They&amp;rsquo;ve been living on their own ever since the incident that totally did not happen (and anyone who says otherwise is a damned liar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There I go again, off on another tangent. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it, and type up my journal entries while I still can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/02/17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much has happened here since the Halloween incident that we aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to talk about. I&amp;rsquo;ve been much busier than usual, dealing with the aftermath as well as the cult. The Mathmetists have been cleaning out our inventory on a daily basis, planning ahead for some kind of secret event that I only get to hear about in hushed mutterings and whispers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night is coming earlier, and the weather is getting colder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/03/17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man in the trench coat is back. He&amp;rsquo;s standing just outside the gas station door, staring in. He&amp;rsquo;s been there for almost an hour now. On the bright side, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a customer come in since he showed up. On the not-so-bright side, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like he&amp;rsquo;s trying to put thoughts into my head. He won&amp;rsquo;t be able to, though. I&amp;rsquo;ve had way too much practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kieffer came in earlier today, before the sun went down, and sat in a booth drinking coffee for a while. Eventually, Spencer Middleton showed up. Spencer had a word with Kieffer, then came storming up to my register, screaming at the top of his lungs. He grabbed the display of lotto scratch-offs and threw it across the room. It was obvious that something had upset him. That&amp;rsquo;s when I took the earplugs out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything ok?&amp;rdquo; I asked, stupidly. I knew damn well everything was never &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you hear a word I just said?&amp;rdquo; Spencer asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explained to him that I had taken to wearing earplugs in an effort to drown out the sounds of screaming that periodically radiate through the air vents. I guess the screams must have stopped a while ago, or maybe I had imagined them. Either way, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need the earplugs anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Tom walked into the store. His white hair looking even whiter than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer, I could see, became instantly aware of the deputy&amp;rsquo;s presence. &amp;ldquo;Where is he?&amp;rdquo; He half-whispered half-growled, &amp;ldquo;Where is the other one?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Diego?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer sighed. &amp;ldquo;Sure. Diego.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s not due for another twenty minutes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When he gets here, tell him we need to have a chat.&amp;rdquo; With that, Spencer Middleton let out a shrill whistle and left the store. Kieffer jumped out of his seat and followed close behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom helped me pick up the mess and put the lotto display back together without asking a single question. I wish more people could be like Tom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Diego got to work, he told me that he had been having strange dreams. Dreams of something enormous, living, breathing, underground. The dreams always end the same way: with the gas station collapsed into a giant sinkhole. I told him that Spencer was looking for him. That&amp;rsquo;s when Diego grew solemn and asked me if he could show me something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the freezer, behind a stack of boxes labled &amp;ldquo;Non aprire&amp;rdquo; (whatever the hell that means, they&amp;rsquo;ve been here as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve worked here), there is a moving blanket. And inside that blanket is another Kieffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first question for Diego was, &amp;ldquo;You stole the body back?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at the ground and shook his head sheepishly like a toddler that just got busted for cooking meth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You killed another one?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego explained: it was an accident. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man in the trench coat is finally gone. He left claw marks on the glass of the front door. I checked the security footage to confirm my suspicions. He always stays just outside the range of our cameras. Why can&amp;rsquo;t I remember what his face looked like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:30 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro was the first &amp;ldquo;customer&amp;rdquo; in the store after the man in the trench coat left. I told him that I was surprised he was still alive. He mistook this for a compliment and said, &amp;ldquo;Thank you.&amp;rdquo; I asked him if he was ready for the big event, but then he just stared at me blankly. I could tell he had no idea what I was talking about, so I filled him in on how I had put it all together. The unusual cultist activity, the whispers, the buying up all of our supplies. I could tell that something was about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro went pale in the face as I was talking, then ran out of the gas station before I could finish, the 99 cent frozen drink still in his hand. I know I should write up an inventory loss slip for the theft, but I just can&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to do it. As hard as it is to explain, there&amp;rsquo;s just something about Marlboro that makes me genuinely feel sorry for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught myself digging again. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long I was out there, or who was running the store while I was gone. The hole is so deep now that I nearly couldn&amp;rsquo;t climb out on my own. I should maybe think about considering the possibility of one day asking a doctor if this is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro is currently crying in the dry storage closet. Through his sobs I could barely make out the story. Marlboro was sent on some kind of &amp;ldquo;Vision Quest&amp;rdquo; for the last week and has no idea what the other cultists had been stocking up for. When he went back to the compound earlier tonight, he found the whole place completely deserted. Beds were left unmade. Some plates had food on them. A fire still burning in the fireplace. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s clothes were still in their personal milk crates next to their sleeping bags. But the people–all of the people–were simply gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro isn&amp;rsquo;t taking this very well, but I have a business to run, so I asked Diego to help me carry him into the dry storage area. I figure he can work through some stuff in there and then maybe when he&amp;rsquo;s done he&amp;rsquo;ll just&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; go home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/04/17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exterminators just left. They say they got all of the snakes this time, but I have my doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/05/17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kieffer came into the store again today and made some thinly-veiled threats. He asked about Diego, too, but I told him that I was tired of being the go-between and that if he had business with Diego, he needed to take it up with Diego. That&amp;rsquo;s when Kieffer started getting weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know this place is just a big experiment, and you&amp;rsquo;re the little mouse?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Kieffer to buy something or leave, so he bought a pack of toothpaste, then started to undress in the store and rub the toothpaste on his naked body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They tell me that something is wrong with your brain. Is that true?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to be polite and avert my eyes as I answered, &amp;ldquo;Yeah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have some kind of mental condition?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered again, &amp;ldquo;Yeah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s too bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Kieffer was completely naked. He walked over to the frozen drink machine and filled a large cup with the sugary red concoction before turning it upside down on top of his head. Then he shook himself violently like a wet dog, flinging bits of cold, sticky debris across everything from the ceiling to the walls. Some of it even landing on my face, but I tried not to let him see my flinch. I knew this was all just an attempt to intimidate me, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give him the satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is it, exactly?&amp;rdquo; He asked as he crossed back to where his pile of clothes waited for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is your condition? Paranoia? Schizophrenia? The gay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; I answered, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t sleep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t sleep?&amp;rdquo; He sounded genuinely interested. &amp;ldquo;Like, ever?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t fall asleep. I haven&amp;rsquo;t slept a single day since high school. It&amp;rsquo;s a rare genetic condition with no cure and no treatment and one day, it will kill me. But until then, I handle the effects as best I can.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kieffer nodded. &amp;ldquo;That must be it. That must be why he can&amp;rsquo;t reach you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why who can&amp;rsquo;t reach me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then, Spencer came into the store. He threw a blanket around Kieffer and ushered him out to the waiting SUV. A moment later, he came back into the store and offered me a hundred dollars for the security tape from tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what I&amp;rsquo;ll spend my hundred bucks on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was beginning to suspect something wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right in the store. I&amp;rsquo;ve been finding empty candy bar wrappers strewn about, security tapes mysteriously deleted, strange noises coming through the walls in the middle of the night when I should be alone. At least, more strange noises than usual. At first, I assumed it was just the racoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I know the truth. Now I know that Marlboro has been living here for the last two days. He just walked out of the supply closet wearing a bathrobe, nodded to me as he grabbed a stick of meat jerky, and went into the bathroom. It had not even occurred to me that Marlboro never left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/06/17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It finally happened. I suppose it was only a matter of time. I know I should feel regret, or shame, or any of the other emotions that normal people feel after something like this happens, but all I feel is embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to a couple hours ago with a shovel in my hand. I had been digging again, and this time I had made some serious progress. The hole was at least seven feet deep, the steep walls made of loose, red clay. It took me a while to realize that I was staring up into an inky black night peppered with uncountable stars. When some of the bigger celestials started to move, I realized that those stars were actually just the soulless red eyes of the mutant raccoons staring down at me over the edge of the hole. Probably looking for food, those shameless beggars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chucked the shovel out of the hole, and that&amp;rsquo;s when I heard it. Imagine the sound of a butcher&amp;rsquo;s knife hitting a watermelon. Like a solid, wet, thwack. Now imagine the watermelon gurgling and falling over like a sack of potatoes. Oh man, this metaphor has really gotten away from me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I climbed out of the hole, I saw the shovel standing upright: the business end firmly lodged inside the open chest wound of a still-twitching Kieffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kieffer was dead before I got to his side. In a final act of defiance, he had turned both of his middle fingers up to me. I felt just the slightest amount of respect for him before I went into a mental state that I can only describe as &amp;ldquo;subdued panic.&amp;rdquo; The first thing I wanted to do was find something to wrap the body in because, surely, Spencer Middleton would come for it soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went into the gas station, I was surprised to find that Marlboro had taken it upon himself to work the cash register while I was gone. He was ringing up one of our regulars, Charles, a great big fat man that always buys soap and boiled peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nabbed a tarp off the shelf and took it outside. That&amp;rsquo;s when I learned something. Kieffer is heavy. Like, really heavy. I understand that a human body is basically just a meaty fleshy water balloon full of guts and excrement, but nothing could prepare me for how leaky and gross and heavy a dead man can be. It was only by some miracle that I managed to drag Kieffer through the back door and into the freezer without being seen. It took all of my strength to pull the mass behind the boxes and onto the stack with the other three. When I finally finished, I had worked up a sweat, and even the cold of the freezer wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough to keep me cool. As I stood there letting my breath come back and adrenaline wear off I took stock of my situation. That&amp;rsquo;s when it dawned on me. There were four Kieffers in that freezer with me. Four. Kieffers. Where the hell did the other two come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freezer door opened and Marlboro entered, dragging a dead Kieffer by the legs. He stopped and made eye contact with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he saw the Kieffers at my feet, I said the only thing I could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well this is awkward.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro and I decided to open a bottle of Strega Liquore and have a few drinks. He explained that he had accidently killed Kieffer a couple times. I totally understood. The guy was just so easy to kill. At one point, Diego came into the freezer to grab a box of cookie dough. He didn&amp;rsquo;t even acknowledge all the Kieffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My laptop&amp;rsquo;s battery is currently at 2%. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious now that I won&amp;rsquo;t have time to transcribe the rest of my journals before it dies. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to tell you how I ended up at the bottom of this hole underneath the store with a broken leg. But I can tell you that I hear someone moving around above me, which is good because I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m alone down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, it means I managed to upload my story. If you&amp;rsquo;re not reading this, then&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know, what even are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone just called my name from the top of the precipice. I think it was Diego. I wonder what happened to Tom. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t Tom ever show up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, I seem to remember Tom didn&amp;rsquo;t survive the Halloween incident. Wait, who the hell have I been talking to this entire time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promise, that if I survive long enough to recharge my battery I will come back and tell the rest. Until then, I guess this story is to be continued.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Part Five</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I received a reply from the former Lost Media Society admin, the one who was said to be attempting to collect lost episodes. He told me he was not aware of an &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; lost episode version, but that he was nevertheless now in possession of several lost episode copies, and was willing to show them to me, for a price. To be exact, he wanted a thousand dollars. I agreed without hesitation. I was not at a point in my life where I could comfortably spend a thousand dollars on anything let alone a prospect that might not deliver, but I was afraid trying to talk him down to a lower offer would make him break contact, and something in my gut told me his claims at least were sincere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave me the address of a secluded cabin he said he would rent for the purpose, which was several states away. He said to come alone, and gave me the exact date he expected me there. I was a little put off by his curt tone, but figured he was paranoid of someone stealing his collection, or worse, being hunted down by the people who made the items. I prepared for the trip and left immediately. When I arrived in the state where the cabin was, it was still a couple days until our meeting date, so I checked into a hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was up late, watching TV in my hotel room with the lights off, when I found a channel playing &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt;. It was in the middle of the movie, but I kept watching. I grew nervous. I had already watched the whole movie, and knew there was nothing unwholesome in the standard version. But the setting, alone in the dark with just the light of the TV, was strongly reminiscent of my traumatic virgin experience with the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon though, my unease turned to comfort. I realized there was nothing to fear. Sure, at this point I was convinced that somewhere out there existed a violent and twisted version of &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt;, one which I had been unfortunate enough to somehow see as a child, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt me now. I laughed as I realized I now had the chance to relive the memory without the trauma. So I grabbed a snack and continued watching in the dark, for once able to enjoy the film as it was intended to be enjoyed. I was able to appreciate what a truly great movie it was, how much effort was put into the animation and voices, how great even the music was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack was a little distorted though. As I turned up the volume to hear it better I realized it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the TV. The music became faster and more distorted, and the scene began morphing into abstract images. I heard screams from the TV, and disturbing images too brief to make out clearly flashed on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all ended with the still image of Berlioz, the one I found on the internet with his eyes bloodshot. On the image were two words in red caps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STOP ASKING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen then went to black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat in total darkness, my body quaking, tears and snot running down my face, hardly able to catch my breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned on the lights, threw up in the bathroom, and switched the channel. All the stations were playing normal television, which was somewhat comforting, but I still checked out of the hotel and went to a different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I considered giving up the hunt. My first goal had been to find out if lost episodes were real, and I had certainly achieved at least that. Whether going further and finding out the exact nature and origin of them was worth it was becoming an increasingly dubious prospect. Whoever was behind them had powers and resources to seriously threaten me, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if full closure was worth risking my neck any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I decided to keep going though. I was close now, and if there was some secret, powerful group behind all these lost episode stories, the world needed to know. Who were they, to try to intimidate me into giving up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give up the hunt. At that moment I doubled down in my determination. At the appointed time, I showed up at the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was night, and the moon flooded the lonely cabin in an eerie glow. There was a vehicle in the driveway, but the lights were out and there were no other signs of occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I timidly went up and knocked on the door. Without turning on any lights, the man greeted me. For his own safety I will not describe the man save to say that he appeared middle-aged. &amp;ldquo;So, you were serious about this. Good. Do you have the money?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave him the wallet of cash. He turned a lamp on and counted it out, then motioned for me to follow him to another room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He closed the door behind him before turning on the light. The room had a high ceiling and nature paintings on the wall, along with a single shelf of old books that were clearly there for decoration. Centered on one of the walls was a large plasma television. There was a lot of space, but the man himself had only put a couple chairs and some plastic storage tubs on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, here&amp;rsquo;s my collection. It ain&amp;rsquo;t very big, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have a hard time finding these items anywhere else. Sorry to have to charge you so much, but you gotta realize I&amp;rsquo;m taking a huge risk by showing this stuff to a stranger, so you gotta make it worth my while.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trembled with anticipation. At last, I was about to have some real, concrete answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like I said in my email, I don&amp;rsquo;t have, nor have I previously heard of an &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; video made by these people, but from how you described it I completely believe you saw it. It fits right in with the kind of thing they would make,&amp;rdquo; he continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By &amp;rsquo;they&amp;rsquo;, you mean the Lost Media Group?&amp;rdquo; I interjected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah. They would be behind the thing you saw, along with that Batman lost episode if it indeed exists, though I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find it myself, but again, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what their goal is in making these things, but they&amp;rsquo;re interesting as hell so I collect them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if he could share some of his contacts, but he flatly refused. &amp;ldquo;I only give that information to trusted friends, and even if you were one of them I would make you pay more than you could afford. Please don&amp;rsquo;t ask me that again. You&amp;rsquo;re lucky I even agreed to show you my collection.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a little flustered by his tone, so I just nodded, then we got down to business. He opened one of the tubs and pulled out a VCR, along with a black VHS tape with a white label that read &amp;ldquo;Pink Panther&amp;rdquo; in black sharpie. He hooked up the VCR, inserted the tape, and played it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lost episode from the Pink Panther cartoon series, which was a show consisting of short sketches, about five or six minutes each, with the Pink Panther going on various solo adventures and getting into trouble with other characters and situations, which he manages with his superior mastery of cartoon physics. There is never any dialogue, save for the occasional wordless exclamation or babbled nonsense, like in the Tom and Jerry cartoons, and every short has the Pink Panther theme playing throughout. I had watched a little of the show as a kid, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have many memories of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode was called &amp;ldquo;40 Shades of Pink&amp;rdquo;, which I assumed was a pun on how Ireland is said to have &amp;ldquo;40 shades of green&amp;rdquo;, since this was a St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day themed episode. It took place in a green land that, while not explicitly identified as Ireland, was obviously supposed to be the Emerald Isle or at least some generic insular Celtic fantasy land. The short involved the Pink Panther trying to steal a pot of gold from a leprechaun, or rather, the recurring &amp;ldquo;Little Man&amp;rdquo; character dressed as one. As the Pink Panther was walking over a rainbow like a bridge, a storm cloud caused it to disappear from under his feet. He fell, and there was a sickening crunching sound. The Pink Panther was shown bleeding out on the ground, bones jutting out. Then he saw the leprechaun’s pot and crawled over to it. Despite his injuries, a smile of victory crawled across his face. As he peered down into the pot, the leprechaun appeared from behind and pushed him in, closing a lid over him and then roasting him alive over a fire. The episode ended with the sound of the Pink Panther screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lame&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. Someone basically just took the Pink Panther cartoon and gave it the &lt;em&gt;Itchy and Scratchy&lt;/em&gt; treatment. It was somewhat disturbing that whoever did it clearly had access to the original animation resources to make it look exactly like a real episode, but overall it was underwhelming compared to what I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next item was a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;. This time it was a proper factory copy with a retail jacket. The man told me the movie itself was normal, but there was a special animated short at the end of the tape with &amp;ldquo;psychedelic properties.&amp;rdquo; He warned me that the experience would be far more intense than the Pink Panther tape and even asked me if I had any heart conditions. Despite his warnings, I insisted on going through with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He refused to fast-forward to the short, saying he wanted to keep the tapes from warping even though he had the footage digitally archived. After the credits, there were some special features, including some animated shorts I had never seen before. When the title appeared for a short called &amp;ldquo;The Lion&amp;rdquo;, the man paused and asked once again if I was sure I wanted to proceed. I nodded, and he played it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short featured what was apparently a version of Scar, but the art style was completely different. It was a 2D animation, but somehow much more realistic than Pixar animation. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like CGI realism, but there was so much detail and effort put into the character that it gave the impression of realism while still being paradoxically fantastical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clip showed Scar walking around a white background before stopping to face the viewer. The &amp;ldquo;camera&amp;rdquo; began slowly zooming in on his face, and his eyes began glowing red. Threatening &amp;ldquo;jungle music&amp;rdquo; began playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I became very nervous. A vicious grimace emerged on Scar&amp;rsquo;s face, the kind a predator makes before striking. His mouth opened wide, showing rows of sharp teeth, and I heard realistic growling sounds. His face wrinkled in a pattern consistent with the face a lion makes before pouncing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nervousness turned to terror. My gaze was transfixed on the screen, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look away. I knew it was only animated, and even if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the lion couldn&amp;rsquo;t get to me through the screen, but I was paralyzed as if facing a real predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a trance, one that didn&amp;rsquo;t break until Scar jumped and I screamed for my life. I kept screaming until the man shook me out of it. &amp;ldquo;Sorry about that,&amp;rdquo; he said &amp;ldquo;but I did warn you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got my bearings back, I asked for the next item. He gave me a puzzled look, as if he had expected me to just give up and want to go home after the last tape, but he shrugged and got the next one. It was another home VHS tape labeled &amp;ldquo;Super Bowl 2000&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This next one won&amp;rsquo;t do anything to you like the lion video, but it&amp;rsquo;s disturbing in what it shows. In fact I&amp;rsquo;ll just tell you what it is: this tape shows a riot that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, there was no sports riot at the 2000 Super Bowl, certainly not in the stadium itself. But the tape shows just that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the man refused to skip to the interesting part to preserve the integrity of the tape. In the third quarter, a referee made a call that didn&amp;rsquo;t sit well with Titans fans, and someone threw a beer bottle. More people started throwing things, and it escalated into a full-scale riot in which spectators swarmed the field and attacked each other. You could see the majority of the crowd slowly evacuating the venue while a small but determined segment began vandalizing the place and having sporadic brawls. There was no commentary at this point, just raw stadium footage that cycled through various venue cameras. About 20 minutes into the riot, the tape ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tape did not cause me to experience abject terror like the last one, in fact the riot hadn&amp;rsquo;t even been that bad compared to other sports riots I&amp;rsquo;d seen, but I found it disturbing on a deeper level. The fact that they could alter a recording of a sports event to make it show something that so blatantly didn&amp;rsquo;t happen in reality terrified me. They could only have done it in one of two ways: with editing techniques that were well beyond what was publicly known to the world, or with some type of magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still asked to see the next item. The man said it was the last one. It was a plug-and-play video game this time. The man explained that the Lost Media Group was known to dabble in other mediums besides movies and television, and that in particular they were said to produce a lot of &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; video games, though this was the only one he had been able to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was labeled &amp;ldquo;Pokémon: Black Carbonite.&amp;rdquo; I actually remembered hearing about Nintendo making a Pokémon plug-and-play game that was cancelled, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if that was the title. The thing was black, and bore a white image of Pikachu, sporting a menacing grin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to let you play this. I myself will never play it again. This thing will mess you up and is downright dangerous. You can examine the hardware though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took it from him and did so. The first thing I noticed upon closer inspection was a fissure in the control pad. A lot of force had been applied to make the crack. Then I noticed that some of the plastic was warped&amp;hellip; melted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the man. He gave me a look back, a look of understanding that there was nothing more that needed to be said. I handed the game back to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man said some goodbye formalities, put his hand over my shoulder, and aggressively led me to the door, closing and locking it behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never saw my camera. During the &amp;ldquo;Lion&amp;rdquo; short, I had managed to snap a quick digital photo of the TV screen while the man wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking, and had put the camera back away before the whole bad acid trip thing. I had the photo enlarged and enhanced and studied it. It was still frightening even without the psychedelic properties of the animated short. Again, despite being a cartoon, it had such detail and realism that it seemed more alive than I thought a cartoon could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Chapter 5: Entropy</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the original game, the 6th world was Pluto. Ironically, despite being the
smallest planet, Pluto was the largest and most diverse world in the game.
Entropy had a different layout, but was similarly huge and diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board music was played by a violin instrument, a melody that started out
sounding mournful and then it gets rather&amp;hellip; I guess I would call it &amp;ldquo;distorted&amp;rdquo;?
It made me feel depressed and unnerved. Not something I would want to hear while
trying to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, none of the levels from the previous worlds were present here,
instead there were eight brand-new icons. The bosses this time were Megalon,
Battra, and Mechagodzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/entropy-board2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, the first thing I did was go to the Quiz Level for another
interrogation from Face. But I when I got there, I noticed something different;
instead of the usual goofy GH1D0RA music, it was the Password theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music change seemed to be intentional, because after the first two questions
at the start, the quiz started to take on a darker tone;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you like Ice Cream?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you like clowns?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is time slipping through your fingers?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any regrets?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Hurt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do some people deserve to die?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Weird Face #3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it safe to go out at night?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you find it hard to sleep at night?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you killed anyone?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Weird Face #7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to kill anyone?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Angry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you actually accomplishing anything?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Weird Face #4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does life have any real meaning?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you like Mothra?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Maniacal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/likemothra.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/likemothra.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Do you like Mothra?&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew that last one was gonna be a gameplay related question, but I had no idea
what the result would be. I answered honestly, because as I said before I never
liked Mothra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody liked playing as Mothra in this game. And there was a good reason for
that, every other time Mothra gets hit she gets slammed back to the left corner
of the screen, and she sucks at fighting because her attacks are so weak. The
only benefit Mothra had was being able to fly over obstacles in some levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I answered No, and Face actually replied back to me, not only with the
maniacal expression, but with text;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;TOO BAD!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/toobad.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/toobad.png&#34;  alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;TOO BAD!&amp;rdquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was taken back to the map screen, and I was shocked to see that Godzilla and
Anguirus has disappeared from the board, leaving only Mothra. Face had just
fucked me over. Needless to say, I was pissed. But there wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything I could
do, and I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet even if I had said &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;, I would have been stuck
with Mothra anyway. Face giveth, and Face taketh away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/entropy-board3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath, and got ready to explore. There were two paths I could
take through the board, I decided to take the lower one. This turned out to be a
good choice for reasons I&amp;rsquo;ll get to momentarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first world ahead me of was a forest, so I started there. Almost
immediately, I got an eerie feeling. There was something about this level that
just seemed &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; to me, even more than the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was the pitch black background. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been afraid of being in a
forest at night. Something about all those trees, makes me feel surrounded and
vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/forest1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/forest1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Forest&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the fact that I was stuck as Mothra didn&amp;rsquo;t help. Playing the game&amp;rsquo;s previous
worlds as Godzilla gave me a feeling of bravery, being in control of the King of
The Monsters, I&amp;rsquo;d be able to handle just about anything in my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not like that with Mothra. No feeling of strength, or security. Now I&amp;rsquo;m
just a weak, easily overwhelmed bug, traversing into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the level. The music had new instruments, sounding like woodwinds,
followed by slow, rhythmic drums and chiming bells. Gave me this feeling that I
was intruding into some dangerous place I really should not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, I encountered the first enemies of the stage. Or at least I
assumed they were enemies. They were strange, long legged deer like creatures.
Instead of attacking, they were just idly walking around. I went to approach
them, and they ran away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought about shooting one with an eye beam to see what would happen, but it
seemed wrong. These creatures were harmless. So I passed over them and continued
through the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About halfway through, I encountered groups of the deer-like animals, and also
two new creatures: A sloth like creature with a beak climbing on a tree, and
hairy raptor-esque beasts that were preying on the deer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very surreal watching these creatures interact. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was
playing a video game, but rather that I was traveling through a forest in some
other dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creatures ignored me for the most part, although the raptors did attack me
when I got too close, or if I attacked them first. I know I shot one of them to
help one of the deer creatures escape. I got clawed at, but confrontation was
easily avoided by flying up to the top of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, I had to choose whether I wanted to play the levels with the
hourglass, or the TV screen. I picked the latter. What I got was not at all what
I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/beaver.gif&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I pressed the button to start a level on the TV Screen like I normally
would, this screen with an animation popped up. There was also music in the
background, which was the goofy Gh1d0ra music that used to be playing in the
Quiz levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was somewhat unsettled by this because it was just so strange. I also found it
a bit spooky because I had a shirt that looked just like that when as a kid.
After starting the animation, you could go back to the board by pressing any
button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I had no what to expect of the rest of these icons. I went to try an
hourglass icon next. I was somewhat relieved when an actual level came up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/timewarp1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was certainly an unorthodox looking level. All brown, with time measuring
instruments floating in the air and gigantic grandfather clocks in the
background. The music was the same as the board screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And very early in the level I encountered something else I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to see:
Original enemies from the game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/timewarp2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And not just that, it seemed to be a whole fleet of them. And the yellow tanks,
which were normally immobile, could now move. I took some damage, but it was
nothing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle. But the most interesting thing about this level was
the colored hourglass items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/hourglass-1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 3 of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blue hourglass, that made time slow down and filled the level with enemies
from the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A red hourglass, that made time speed up and filled the level with enemies
from the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A green hourglass, that set time to the normal speed, and filled the level
with the original game enemies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/timewarp4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encountered the blue hourglass first. As stated, the game started to slow
down, and I saw the &amp;ldquo;enemies from the past&amp;rdquo;, which were five different types of
prehistoric animals. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about prehistory, but I believe all of
these enemies represent real animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level went into another segment, and I encountered the green hourglass, and
then I fought the original enemies again. It was the same five types so I didn&amp;rsquo;t
take any screenshots. But in the last segment, I encountered the red hourglass,
and the enemies that must have been from the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, whether or not the game was showing me 8-bit renditions of creatures that
will actually exist thousands of years into Earth&amp;rsquo;s future, I have no idea. But
with that thought in mind, I found this particular segment to be very eerie, and
it was made more tense because everything moved faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/timewarp5.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the future enemies bore a striking resemblance to something I saw in a
book once, called &amp;ldquo;Troodon Man&amp;rdquo;. Another looked like some kind of organic
spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/timewarp6.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was only one of the fifth type of Future creature, and when it appeared,
all the others ran for their lives, leaving me alone to battle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could fly but its sprite didn&amp;rsquo;t actually move, and its single attack was
firing a lightning bolt from its &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo;. Even so, it was surprisingly powerful,
and I suppose it could be considered a mini-boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/timewarp7.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After defeating it, it left a health power-up that restored the health and
energy I had lost fighting it. Which was convenient! It seemed I would need all
the help I could get to beat this world with Mothra alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that previous stage I call &amp;ldquo;Time Warp&amp;rdquo;, the next stage appeared to be a
Toxic Waste Dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/toxic1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the place looked grungy, and inhospitable. The music was a short
looping of an ambient synthesizer song. Listening to it made me feel like I had
sniffed some toxic fumes myself, and it was messing with my head the whole time.
I even felt like I was choking while playing this level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/toxic2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enemies all seem to be mutated to some degree. In the above screenshot you
can see green mummies with bird skulls, that jump out of the waste to spit
projectiles. There&amp;rsquo;s also a brownish cow skeleton monster with spider legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/toxic3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the level I even saw one of the deer from the forest. It was
alone, and when I saw it, it was drinking toxic waste out of a barrel with an
anteater-like tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/toxic4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was moving over to try to make it stop, but then this flock of skull birds
came out of nowhere and started attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deer was scared by this and ended up running off the ground into the toxic
waste. I feel bad for it. One of the birds bit me, but I regained health quick
from killing all of them, they were rather weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pressed onward. Of all the levels in Entropy, this was probably the most
&amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;, in that there was little deviance from the &amp;ldquo;Move forward, smash
things&amp;rdquo; formula in the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/toxic5.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encountered more creatures through the level, like tentacled blobs, and some
kind of deformed thing with human-like teeth. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like provoking them
into a fight, so I kept on flying near the top of the screen. I still had to
deal with occasional flock of birds now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/toxic6.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the level was a large, bluish green lake, and there I encountered
another mini-boss. Some kind of a monster with a long neck and a whale&amp;rsquo;s skull.
It attacks with a mouth projectile, and by charging into you. It also could go
underneath the water and rapidly emerge from a different place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was harder to beat than the boss from the Time Warp, and it had a lot of
health because it must have taken me three minutes to defeat it. It let out a
really loud noise when it died, and then sank back into the water as I left the
screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the board, I went to the nearest level icon I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen yet, which was
a white tree. As I guessed, the level was a winter themed recolor of the forest
stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/winter1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike the regular forest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel unnerved starting this one. I think
the music had a lot to do with it. It was a gentle, calm song, it almost sounded
romantic. It was quite stress relieving, and the forest itself looked much less
ominous covered in snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traveled through the first segment enjoying the atmosphere for four minutes,
when suddenly I realized something: I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a single creature since I
started the level. Where are all the animals? Soon after, I left the screen, and
the next segment started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second segment, I was still in the winter forest, but now the music was
gone. I was starting to feel suspicious, but then I reminded myself that there
were other empty levels in the game and this was likely another one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then&amp;hellip; I heard something familiar. It was the twelve second looping music
from &amp;ldquo;UNFORGIVING COLD&amp;rdquo; starting up. I could feel my heart sink as I came across
this horrible sight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a whole group of dead deer creatures, covered in snow. Judging from the
blackish blue tone of their skin, they must have all frozen to death. On closer
inspection, some were missing body parts. Now I was frightened. But I still had
to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before exiting the level, I was really hoping to see something resembling the
previous forest animals in a living state. And sure enough, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/winter3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a creature much like the beaked sloth, except this thing had white fur
and was more of a beaked gorilla. It was walking very slowly when I saw it, but
I was happy to at least see something alive. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t stay that way
for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/winter4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pack of raptors, who must have sensed that something else was still alive,
came rushing in from the right side of the screen. The beaked gorilla didn&amp;rsquo;t
stand a chance, as one of the raptors immediately lunged at it and ripped open
its back legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &amp;ldquo;winter raptors&amp;rdquo; acted far different from their temperate relatives. While
the other raptors only attacked while hunting prey or when provoked, the winter
raptors seemed to have all gone insane. They attacked everything in sight, one
was running back and forth clawing at nothing. Even the noises they made sounded
different, more high pitched and enraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I left this second segment, I even saw two Raptors fighting to the death.
They were both covered in injuries, and one of the Raptors had been blinded in
one eye. I took a screenshot, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t stay to see who won the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only had to get through one more segment before I could go back to the board
screen. But in this segment, I was no longer in the winter forest, but instead a
very empty grassy plain, with a bright gray moon in the sky. The pleasant music
of Winter Forest part 1 had returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And immediately, I started to feel dread. This is going to sound crazy but it&amp;rsquo;s
the absolute truth: The game made this level from one of my memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long stretch of nothing, I reached a lake. And then, the moon moved down
from the sky, and begin to hatch like an egg. When it did, a curled up humanoid
figure fell into the lake as the moon halves quickly disintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard a splash when it hit the water, then a moment of silence. Then the
screen began to shake, and a new creature emerged from the water;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thus I was introduced to a monster I call the &amp;ldquo;Moon Beast&amp;rdquo;. This was the
only screenshot I took, as I was focusing all my concentration on winning the
fight. And it was the most difficult fight yet. Stronger than any of the
previous bosses, this creature would have been hard to take down with Godzilla,
and with Mothra it seemed nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I would consider myself fortunate that the beast lacked any attacks
like Gigan&amp;rsquo;s saw, because if it had I would never have won this. I barely had
three bars of health when I finally killed this abomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happened afterward is hardly what I could call a reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to keep my promise and suppress this memory for years, but
it seems as if I have to get it off my chest. This is a very painful memory for
me, but the game already knows about it and I think you should too. I&amp;rsquo;ll just
tell you the important parts, because I don&amp;rsquo;t like bringing this experience back
into my head unless I have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was in Middle school, I had a girlfriend named Melissa. She suffered
from some kind of mental disorder that caused her to go into &amp;ldquo;episodes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was in an &amp;ldquo;episode&amp;rdquo;, she would stand or sit perfectly straight and
still, and her face would instantly lose any expressions she had before. She
would speak very clearly, without any hint of emotion. When it was over, she
would start trembling and sometimes bury her face in her hands, and remain
silent for several minutes. I can&amp;rsquo;t really convey the feeling it gave me in
words, and I won&amp;rsquo;t try. You had to see this in person to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite this, she was a very kind person and I cared about her dearly. We
liked to hang out in a field at night, and look at the stars. But one night she
didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything to me at all, she just stared directly at the moon,
trembling. I tried to talk to her, but she suddenly sprung up, and ran right
into traffic. I tried to stop her, but I was too late. She got hit by a truck,
and was killed that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked her right in the eyes when the wheels went over her neck. That sight
has always haunted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the game knows about this because after I defeated the Moon
Beast&amp;hellip; this happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After&amp;hellip; THAT, the game went back to the board screen. It was all I could do not
to burst out screaming, and my hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the
controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew the game was going to test me if I kept playing. But I had no idea it
would go so far. Or that it was even capable of doing what it just did. I could
feel my brain going haywire as I asked myself &amp;ldquo;Did the game just read my mind?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn&amp;rsquo;t seem possible. But what other explanation was there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then that I could no longer deny what now seemed obvious: This game is
alive. And not only that, it also can establish some kind of mental connection
with the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet&amp;hellip; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t convince myself to stop playing. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was the
game messing with my mind, or just my stubborn curiosity, but even with the
previous revelation, I really wanted to see this through to the end. Even more
than I did before I beat Dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrifying as it might be, even dangerous, I knew that if I quit playing, I
would never be able to stop thinking about it. If I tried to restart the game,
it might go back to being normal again. How many people ever get to witness
something like this firsthand, let alone be able to take screenshots of the
whole thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucked up as it was, this was the experience of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even so, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take any chances with my health. I had the TV remote
right next to me, ready to turn the TV off in case I felt I was in actual
danger. And if that didn&amp;rsquo;t work, I would pull the plug out of the wall, or just
run out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, that would be enough&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever powers the &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; has, it seemed to be confined to what it can show on
the TV and, whatever its &amp;ldquo;mental connection&amp;rdquo; could do. The latter was what
worried me. I still didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was dealing with, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to
underestimate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a break for a few minutes to calm my nerves. And then it was back to the
game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of TVs: There was a TV screen icon right below the white forest I
had just left, and because the first animation was so bizarre I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try
another to see what happens. Although I expected the same animation, I actually
got a totally different one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/fishman.gif&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weird. The music for this one was the Neptune board music. Fitting I suppose,
since it&amp;rsquo;s a fishman and all. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but what wonder what the point of
these things are. There was one more TV screen icon so I figured it must have a
unique animation of its own. I was going to make sure to see what it was before
I left Entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it was time for another level. The gold brick icon was the closest
thing, so I went to that, and I started up in a &amp;ldquo;Gold Labyrinth&amp;rdquo; level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/gold1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My health and power were refilled. Not sure how or why, but I was glad not to be
heading in the unknown nearly dead. I also noticed that my Mothra sprite had
shrunk to half its original size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music was a slow, ominous drum beat, with female vocals kicking in about a
minute into it. Quite haunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gold Labyrinth itself was an anomaly. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how this level would have
played out if I was using Godzilla or Anguirus, because flying seemed necessary
just to get around this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/gold2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that caught my attention was that when you go left, your monster
actually turns and faces the left. That sounds stupidly obvious, but in the
original game you were only supposed to move to the right, so when you tried to
move left your monster ended up walking/flying backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level was apparently gigantic in size, because every time I thought I had
reached an end to it, or thought I was going to end up back where I started, I
encountered something totally new. Things like lava blockades, new enemies, and
statue faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/gold4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I found one statue face at a dead end with a wide, open eyed stare. The
night Melissa died, she had an expression on her face that looked exactly like
this the whole time. Even when she got hit by the truck, she still had that same
expression. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like something really is staring at me from
behind the screen when I look at this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/gold5.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be reminded of that night anymore, so I left the statue
almost as soon as I found it. I needed to find the exit anyway, which proved to
be no simple task. It felt like this level stretched on forever in all
directions. I must have wandered around the level for at least fifteen minutes
before I finally saw something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a creature that wasn&amp;rsquo;t gold. Seemingly the only one of its kind in the
level. Lacking any kind of hover ability like the other creatures, it just
walked back and forth on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long after I found it that a flying machine swooped down and
grabbed it, and then flew off with it. The machine apparently had not seen me,
so I decided to follow it, to see where it was taking the creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine stopped at a room with a large cauldron-like object in the center.
The machine hovered over to the cauldron and dropped the creature into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creature came emerged from a hole in the cauldron&amp;rsquo;s side, now adorned in the
same gold color as everything else. The machine flew off. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure
what to make of this, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I came upon it, because I found the exit soon
after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I got back to the board I realized that the bosses hadn&amp;rsquo;t moved at all. A
bit odd, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me, it made planning my route through Entropy
easier. There were still two new icons to explore, the Indigo Cliffs and a black
version of the labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there were only three black labyrinth icons (which were surrounded by
bosses) I played the Indigo Cliffs first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a lot like the blue/green mountains. The level graphics had the same
&amp;ldquo;shredded&amp;rdquo; look to it, there&amp;rsquo;s also a recolor of the clouds and moon from the
Toxic Waste Dump. The music, (if you can call it that) was merely a deep
rumbling noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I encountered were these multicolored creatures with big
heads emerging from a small cave in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/cliffs2-1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all made a synchronized shaking sound, and they walked to the right in a
group after emerging from the cave, ignoring me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having no other way to go, I followed them on their route. More and more emerged
from the cave, until the group had about a hundred creatures. Eventually, the
pathway ended in a cliff. I was shocked to see that upon reaching the cliff, all
the creatures began jumping off into the abyss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen enemies walk off cliffs before, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen NPC&amp;rsquo;s commit mass
suicide like this. Very unsettling way to start off a level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued on, flying over various strange animals like the ones shown here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/cliffs4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another group of multicolored &amp;ldquo;bobbleheads&amp;rdquo; was jumping up and down, only to be
snatched up by large birds, which I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain are sprite versions of the
Giant Condor from &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I defeated some of the Condors in battle, but it bothered me that these
bobbleheads seemed to be so eager to die. If the game itself is alive&amp;hellip; perhaps
the creatures in these levels are also &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo;? And some have very unhappy
lives, if this behavior is any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what provokes them to do this? In the back of my mind, I almost suspect that
the glowing moon in the sky is the reason&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the level, I saw yet another group of the bobbleheads, marching up
to a large monster and being devoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was starting to disgust me, so acting on impulse I fired off eyebeams at
both the monster and the bobbleheads. I destroyed the cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monster became angry, and ran through the remaining bobbleheads to fight me.
Although it lacked any ranged attacks, it was relentless. But it was no match
for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the home stretch now, up to the bosses. My plan was to go through
Battra first, then Megalon. After that I would watch the last TV screen, play
the Black Labyrinth before fighting Mechagodzilla. And lastly, going through the
chase with the hell beast. I was curious to see if it would be in a new form
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first things first, time to beat up Battra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I expected, he started off in his Larva form. The music was Varan&amp;rsquo;s battle
theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/battra1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/battra1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Batta&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever the game puts in a new Godzilla kaiju with more than one form, that
other form always shows up. For a game that&amp;rsquo;s otherwise inexplicable, it&amp;rsquo;s
rather startling in its consistency and accuracy with the new kaiju bosses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight started off simple. Larva Battra fought in a similar fashion as Maguma
did, charging back and forth and occasionally firing off lightning from its
horn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the fight, I noticed that Mothra&amp;rsquo;s combat capabilities had been altered
in my favor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The eye beams did 2x as much damage as they did originally, now they were as
strong as Godzilla&amp;rsquo;s punches. The poison powder was similarly improved, it
also did this nice thing were it would actually HIT an enemy when you used it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the original game, even though Mothra could fly, she was unable to fly over
an opponent. You would get knocked back the same way as if you just ran
straight into them, which was extremely annoying. But not any more! I could
change direction and fly around, which was a big help because:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/battra2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/battra2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Batta second form&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting Imago Battra is much like fighting a clone Mothra, although Battra is
distinctly faster and stronger. No longer impeded by its slow-moving Larva form,
Imago Battra was a fearsome opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/battra3.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/battra3.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Batta eye beam&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it lacked the horn lightning, it now had a new, more powerful eye beam.
Battra could change direction just like I could, so this battle involved a lot
of flipping and flying around. It was pretty damned fun, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after defeating Battra, I was excited to see what Megalon would be like. But
first I went through an Indigo Cliffs level, and shot through a lot of the
creatures for the health-power-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/megalon1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/megalon1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Megalon&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So about Megalon. His music was Gigan&amp;rsquo;s theme. Makes sense, since Gigan was his
battle partner in Megalon&amp;rsquo;s one (and so far, only) film appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a lot like Moguera, but faster, and with more weapons. He&amp;rsquo;d start out
charging off with his drills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/megalon2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I liked to fly back and forth around him, which seemed to really annoy him.
After a few seconds, he&amp;rsquo;d step back, turn around and start spitting out
grenades. Those were a pain, because they bounce when they hit the &amp;ldquo;ground&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/megalon3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he started spamming his lightning beam. It only went straight forward,
so it was easy to duck under it and then shoot him with eye beams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/megalon4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d describe him as Strong, Persistent, but Dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was now nearing the end of Entropy. I had just taken down Megalon, and I
started up the last Tv screen, to see what I&amp;rsquo;d get this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/64gsur.gif&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music for this gruesome scene was the Password theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out why this animation was so sinister and violent in
comparison to the other two. The whole game seemed to be growing more
malevolent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I went on to finish Entropy, I began to feel&amp;hellip; drained. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to
describe. Like I had suddenly became tired when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t before. Most likely it
was just the tension from all that had happened in this game getting to me, but
who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Shadow Labyrinth&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last level type on Entropy is what I call the &amp;ldquo;Shadow Labyrinth&amp;rdquo;. The
scenery was recolored from gold to black. The music was an evil ambiance,
similar to the UNFORGIVING COLD loop but distinctly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music was my first sign that this level was going to be distressing. I
traveled through the maze for about a minute, and I noticed there weren&amp;rsquo;t any
creatures hovering around. It was an odd transition from the gold Labyrinth,
which was overrun with creatures, to this level that had nothing at all. But
then this might be a good thing, maybe there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any obstacles and I
could get through the level with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the screen went dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;The dark screen&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And immediately I snapped out of my &amp;ldquo;daze&amp;rdquo; from a few seconds earlier.
Everything had been darkened so that the only thing I could see was the Mothra
sprite. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell where I was going and I ended up frantically running
into walls. I heard a noise, the sound of a crowd running through a hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And along with the running, came the roars. Loud roaring sounds, which I would
describe as something like a rabid dog the size of an elephant, screaming with
fury. And I could tell that whatever was making this noise, there were lots of
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew there was something there, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I did some screencap
editing that I got to see what my pursuers looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow3.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow3.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Shadow Labyrinth enemies&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the time I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see where they were, or where I was going. I was
literally running blind, and this mob of beasts eventually caught up with me.
All I could think was &amp;ldquo;NO!&amp;rdquo; as I saw my lifebar rapidly declining. The monsters
had taken me down to half of my total health, when I was saved. The &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; came
back on, and the attackers had disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow4.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow4.png&#34;  alt=&#34;The lights are back on!&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the challenge of this level was revealed: Find the exit before the lights
go out and a pack of monsters maul you to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in panic mode now, moving as fast I could go while trying every path I
could find for a way out. As I played through the level, the lights went out a
total of three times. The second time, I would have been dead meat had it not
been for one of the wide-eyed statues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow5.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/shadow5.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Shadow face&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I stayed close to it, the monsters seem to all avoid me until the light came
back. The statue warded them away, somehow. I was safe as long as I stayed near
the statue, but at the same time I had to leave to find the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shadow Labyrinth turned out to be much smaller than the Gold Labyrinth, as
it only took about six minutes to navigate to the end. But before the exit,
there was a row of halls leading straight down, with no way out once entered.
You either got to the exit before the monsters reached you, or you died.
Thankfully I made it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one more boss, Mechagodzilla. I started the battle, and got something
unexpected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/mechag1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/mechag1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Godzilla&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did my life shoot back up to 100% again (It seems to do that randomly),
but instead of a replacement boss, I was fighting Godzilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But any Godzilla fan worth their salt can figure this out. Mecha-Godzilla
started off like fighting a clone Godzilla, but his disguise burned away after
only three life bars. Usually a transformation only occurred at the halfway
point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/mechag2-1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point it was like fighting Mecha-Godzilla in the normal game. Felt kinda
nice to fight one of the original game enemies for a change. Although he wasn&amp;rsquo;t
exactly like normal, he also had a rainbow beam and finger missiles. This
prevented me from doing the old trick of backing him in the corner and hitting
with eyebeams in a spot where he can&amp;rsquo;t hit me, but that was always a cheap trick
anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/mechag3-1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after getting him down to half his health, something weird started to happen.
His sprite started to glitch, in much the same way as Gezora had way back in the
first world. After a few seconds, the glitches began to form a new shape…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/mechag4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thus the game had created &amp;ldquo;Not-Mecha-Godzilla&amp;rdquo;, and I discovered that this
visual glitch was somehow related to the game recreating things. The human face
on this one gives it a very uncanny look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/mechag5.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it was a bit stronger, it was also slower than its original
counterpart and couldn&amp;rsquo;t jump around as much. I won the fight by constantly
staying out of its line of fire, bombarding the machine with Poison Powder as I
flew over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing to do: The hell beast chase. Oh boy. &amp;ldquo;Might as well just get this
over with,&amp;rdquo; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/redlabyrinth1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/redlabyrinth1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Red Labyrinth&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Entropy &amp;ldquo;End Chase&amp;rdquo; ended up being exactly what I was afraid it would be: A
Labyrinth level. All the other chases, although difficult, were extremely
straight-forward. You just had to run to the right and not get touched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this took all the simplicity out of it. There was no telling how big this
labyrinth would be, or where the exit was. And now not only did I have to
constantly backtrack to find my way out, I also had to avoid getting one-hit
killed by the red monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those first thirty seconds, it didn&amp;rsquo;t show up. But I knew it would, and
as I started picking up the pace, I heard a loud flapping noise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/redlabyrinth2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/redlabyrinth2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Winged Hell beast&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there it was, in a &amp;ldquo;flying form&amp;rdquo;. It flew with bat-like wings, and was as
fast and relentless as ever. For reasons already stated this was probably the
most nerve-wracking of all the &amp;ldquo;End Chases&amp;rdquo;, and as such I had to keep my focus
on the game and not taking screencaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I did take one of the red monster doing something I found very
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had managed to lose it by going through a different path than it apparently
expected, and it was blocked from attacking me by one of the organic walls of
the Red Labyrinth. Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-5-entropy/wallsmash.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tried clawing through the wall for a second before opening up its mouth and
tearing the wall apart with the intestine jaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those brief milliseconds that the monster was held back might have been the
key to me finding the exit. The path to exit was long and complex, but from what
I remember I went up, and then back towards the left. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure why I
chose that particular way. Just a lucky hunch I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sweating profusely, but my luck had saved me yet again. I hoped that it
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run out before I finished the game. There were only two more worlds to
go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was the penultimate world, called &amp;ldquo;Extus&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the short update, guys. Things have gotten a little crazy around here, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how often I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to update going forward. I really appreciate all the support you guys have given me, and while I only have a couple of stories to share with you, I&amp;rsquo;ll be interested to see what you all think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A firefighter who was helping us at the training op told me about a call he&amp;rsquo;d gone on, supposedly to help rescue a kid from an absolutely massive tree. He said they didn&amp;rsquo;t give him details, just that they needed him to come out and help because they lacked the proper equipment. He&amp;rsquo;d been called out specifically because this thing was so huge that the SARs didn&amp;rsquo;t feel safe trying to climb it. He&amp;rsquo;d been a tree-trimmer before joining the VFD, so it was easy enough for him to grab his old equipment and come help out. He was led out about two miles, and the team stopped at one of the biggest trees in the area and pointed up. He laughed and asked the op captain how the kid had gotten up there, made some joke about the old &amp;lsquo;cat in a tree&amp;rsquo; thing, but the captain just shook his head and told him to get up there and get the kid down. He said he knew something was up, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t push it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that as he climbed this tree, he started wondering if they were playing a prank on him. &amp;ldquo;There was no way this kid should have been able to climb this fuckin’ thing. It was massive at the base, but about halfway up it started tapering, and I almost had to turn back a few times because I really didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was gonna hold me.&amp;rdquo; But he said he kept going, and when he was just about at the top, he saw a flash of blue in the branches. &amp;ldquo;I saw the kid&amp;rsquo;s shirt sort of caught in a branch, and I called out to him and told him to come near me if he could, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything. I kept moving, calling the kid&amp;rsquo;s name and telling him not to be scared, that I was there to help him. By the time I got to him, I knew he wasn&amp;rsquo;t gonna answer me. I found him, or what was left of him, cradled in the fork of a branch, and the fact that he was up there was sheer luck. If he&amp;rsquo;d fallen any other way, he&amp;rsquo;d have come crashing down. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have mattered though, because this kid was dead long before he ended up in that tree.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know who put him there, or how, or why, but it was fucking sick. Kid&amp;rsquo;s intestines had popped out of his mouth, and were hanging in the branches. It was like some sick fucking Christmas tree, the way they were draped all over everything. I got a better look and saw they&amp;rsquo;d even popped out of his ass; his guts were hanging out the bottom of his pants. His eyes were gone, I assume shoved out from whatever force caused him to fucking pop like a stress ball. You ever seen a body that&amp;rsquo;s been floating in water for a long time, how their tongues kind of swell up and stick out? His was like that. I remember because there were flies crawling all over it. I think I must have gone into shock, because&amp;hellip; man, I just pushed that kid down with a stick I broke off a branch. Just kind of poked him until he fell. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I did that&amp;hellip; I almost lost my job because of that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But man, the thought of hauling that kid down over my shoulder the whole way, gathering his guts up and coiling them around me like rope so they wouldn’t get snagged&amp;hellip; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of dead kids. More than I&amp;rsquo;d ever admit. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a kid who hid in a full bathtub during a house fire; boiled him alive, turned him into literal soup. But this&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know what did this, but the thought of touching that kid&amp;rsquo;s body made me feel like I was gonna lose my mind. I heard him hit the ground and I figured everyone would freak out, but they knew he was dead when they sent me up there. They didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything, but they didn’t shout or freak out or anything. I got to the bottom and I started to get up in the captain&amp;rsquo;s face, asking him who he thought he was sending me up there when they knew damn well the kid was dead. But he just told me it was none of my concern, and thanked me for getting the evidence down. I remember he said that, I remember it specifically because it was so weird to hear it phrased that way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;The evidence&amp;rsquo;. Like he wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a person. Like he&amp;rsquo;d never been a little kid who got lost and had something fucking unspeakable happen to him. The captain had a crew lead me back out of the woods, but he and two others stayed behind, and I thought that was weird. Why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t they have me help get the kid out? I tried asking, but the guys leading me out just told me they couldn&amp;rsquo;t discuss an open case.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him what he thought had happened to the kid, and he got really pensive and thought about it for a bit. &amp;ldquo;I would have said a crush injury based on how his guts came out like that, but with those injuries, you see massive contusions under the skin, obvious trauma. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t like that. It was almost like that kid got caught in a big vacuum and had his guts sucked out. But even then, there was no trauma. None at all. It bothers me, man. It bothers the hell out of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the vets at the training op reads NoSleep, and he recognized my stories. He knows me pretty well, and we&amp;rsquo;ve swapped stories before. He asked if he could share something he&amp;rsquo;s noticed about the stairs, and some thoughts he had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m really glad you decided to share these. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important that people be aware of what&amp;rsquo;s out there, especially since the Forest Service is doing such a good job at covering it all up.&amp;rdquo; I asked him what he meant. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean, what do I mean? The lack of any kind of media attention? No coverage of missing kids, or bodies found miles from where they got lost in the first place? David Paulides hit this right on the head, the FS is doing everything they can to keep people coming here, even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t safe. I mean, to be fair, it&amp;rsquo;s not like these things happen every day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But the numbers add up, and it&amp;rsquo;s worth looking into. Especially the stairs. I was surprised you didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the flipped ones.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what he was talking about; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember him ever talking about something like that. He seemed somewhat incredulous. &amp;ldquo;Dude, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe you&amp;rsquo;ve been on this long without seeing them. No one told you about them?&amp;rsquo; I shrugged and asked him to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, there&amp;rsquo;s the normal stairs, the ones that pop up when we&amp;rsquo;re out a ways. I know you know about them. But sometimes, I&amp;rsquo;ve run across ones that are flipped upside down. I guess it would be like if you had a doll house, and the stairs were a separate piece. Now take that, flip it upside down so the top step is stuck in the dirt, and put it out in the woods. They&amp;rsquo;re like that. I don&amp;rsquo;t see them as often, but they&amp;rsquo;re odd, to say the least. Makes me think of footage taken after a tornado, when houses are all blown apart and random things are left standing, like chimneys and garden walls. Those ones freak me out more than the normal ones because I can&amp;rsquo;t really write those off as easily.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t scare very easily, like most of us who work out here, but that idea stuck with me, and it bothers me. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and find more out about them. He also mentioned how many people were bothered by the guy with no face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got really excited and told me he&amp;rsquo;d seen something similar. &amp;ldquo;I was out on a training exercise a few years ago. I was camped out in my tent and I heard someone walking around outside of camp. We&amp;rsquo;re told not to wander far, which you know, so I wondered if maybe it was a rookie who&amp;rsquo;d gotten up to pee and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find his way back. Remember that guy in our group a few years back who almost fell off the damn mountain? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m paranoid about that happening again, so I got up to see what was going on. I went to the edge of camp and called to whoever it was and told them that camp was this way. But they kept going back out into the woods, so I went after them. I know it was stupid, but I was half-asleep and I just really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with some idiot getting hurt. I followed this thing on a dead-straight course for about a mile, and then it stopped on the edge of a little river.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I could see the outline of it because the water was reflecting the moon, and it looked just like an ordinary guy. He had a pack on, and it looked like he was facing me. I asked if he was okay, if he needed help, and he cocked his head like he didn&amp;rsquo;t understand me. I always have my pocket knife on me, and it&amp;rsquo;s got a little thumb light attached to it, so I turned that on and lit up his chest, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t blind him. He was breathing slowly and deep, so I wondered if he was sleepwalking. I went closer and asked him again if he was okay. I moved the light up, and something didn&amp;rsquo;t seem right, so I stopped. He kept breathing these real slow, deep breaths, and I sort of figured out gradually that that&amp;rsquo;s what was bothering me. It was like he was pretending to breathe, but not actually doing it. His breaths were too even and deep, and all his movements were exaggerated, like his shoulders going up and his chest moving.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I told him to identify himself, and he made this muffled noise. I moved the light up and I shit you not, this guy had no face. Just smooth skin. I freaked out, and I sort of fumbled my light, but I saw him move toward me but he didn&amp;rsquo;t actually move. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to explain it, but one second he was at the edge of the river and the next he was five feet from me. I never looked away or blinked, it was like he moved so fast my brain couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up. I tripped and fell on my ass and I could see this line open up on his throat. It stretched up to his ears, and his head tilted back and he smiled at me with his throat. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any blood, just this gaping dark hole, and I swear he smiled at me with this gash in his throat. I got up and I ran as fast as I could back to camp. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear him following me, but I felt like he was always right behind me, even though when I looked back I couldn’t see him. I calmed down when I got back to camp; the fire was still going and I guess that pack mentality of being with other people made me stop and breathe a little. I waited by the fire to see if he&amp;rsquo;d follow me there, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything else for a few hours, so I went back to bed. I know it sounds weird, but the whole thing was just so surreal that it was almost like I immediately wrote it off as my imagination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were telling ghost stories one night before bed just to scare each other and poke fun at whoever got creeped out. Most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s the rookies, but one woman told a story that actually managed to get under my skin a little bit, and I know the same was true for others. She said it was true, but then again, every ghost story told around a campfire is true. Somehow, though, I don&amp;rsquo;t think she was making it up. It had that ring of truth that only really traumatizing events have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that when she was a kid, she and her friend used to go out in the woods behind her house a lot. She lived in northern Maine, where there’s a lot of dense, unpopulated national forest. She said the woods up there aren&amp;rsquo;t like they are here. They&amp;rsquo;re so thick in places that the trees block out the sun almost completely. She and her friend grew up there, so they weren&amp;rsquo;t scared of being out there alone, but they did always maintain a sense of caution in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said it was never really talked about, but they always knew not to go more than a mile or two beyond their homes. The adults never said why, but it was an unspoken rule that no one ventured out that far. She and her friend made up stories about bears as big as houses that lived out there, and they used to scare each other by hiding and making growling noises while the other searched for them. She said one summer, there was a series of awful storms that blew down a lot of trees, and set one part of the forest a few miles behind her house on fire. Fire crews got it under control, but she said some of them came back &amp;rsquo;not quite the same.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was like they&amp;rsquo;d been to war. You could tell who&amp;rsquo;d really gotten scared because they had the same look on their faces. I think it’s called shell-shock. My friend and I said they were like walking dead people. They didn&amp;rsquo;t smile or say anything if you went up to them, and most of them left town as soon as everything was over. I asked my parents about it, but they said they didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was talking about. Once everyone was told the woods were safe again, my friend and I decided to try and hike out to where the fire had been. We didn&amp;rsquo;t tell our parents where we were going, and it was pretty exciting to think that we were disobeying them like that. We hiked out about two miles or so, and we started seeing burnt trees and stuff. I remember my friend got really upset because we found the skeleton of a deer curled up under a tree, and I practically had to drag her away. She wanted to bury it, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want her touching it because its antlers were weird. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember why, I just remember thinking that there was something wrong with them and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want either of us going near it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The farther we went, the more burnt everything got. Eventually, there were no standing trees, and it was like being on another planet. Almost nothing was green, just brown and black everywhere. We were standing there, looking at it all, and we both heard someone shouting in the distance. I panicked because I thought it was my dad, and that he was going to tell me I was grounded. My friend broke off and went to hide behind a big rock, because she said she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be caught out here. Her parents had forbidden her to come out in the woods at all, and she’d lied and told them we were going to a movie. I followed her, and we kept listening. I could hear this voice getting closer, and I realized they were calling for help. I thought maybe it was some hiker who&amp;rsquo;d gotten lost and needed directions back to town. That used to happen all the time, so I was used to helping people out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I heard him following my voice, so I kept calling out until I saw him running in the distance. He got closer and I could see that his face was all red. I told my friend to give me her pack, because she had a first aid kit. She made this noise like she was grossed out, and she asked if I saw his face. I told her to shut up, and I jogged up to meet him. I stopped about halfway and when he stopped in front of me I could see that his nose and lips and part of his forehead were all gone. It was like they&amp;rsquo;d been sliced clean off. He was bleeding bad, and I saw that the knees of his pants were red too. I took a step back but I was too scared to move much, and he grabbed my shoulders. It felt like I got a shock, and he jerked back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He started babbling, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell what he was saying, except that he kept asking how long he&amp;rsquo;d been gone. He asked me where &amp;lsquo;his unit’ was, but I just shook my head. He looked me over and he saw my Walkman and he screamed. He just kept babbling and touching his face, and I realized he wasn&amp;rsquo;t wearing the right clothing. He had some kind of weird grey cloth jacket and almost formal pants on, and the jacket had these weird buttons and red borders on it. I kept shaking my head and I told him I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand what he was saying. I went to open the first aid kit but he just screamed again and said the only thing I could really understand: &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t touch me! You&amp;rsquo;ll make me go back there!&amp;rsquo; After that, he ran off, and I could hear him screaming the whole time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear him anymore, I turned around, and my friend was crying. I just turned around and started walking back toward town.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She asked me over and over what had happened and who that was, but I didn’t say anything. When we got home, I told her I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to play in the woods with her anymore. We&amp;rsquo;re still friends, but we don&amp;rsquo;t talk about that guy. Not ever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll update as soon as I&amp;rsquo;m able, guys. I appreciate the continued support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/the-church-in-the-woods/part-5/White_Eye.png&#34;  alt=&#34;White Eye&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stairs felt like they would never end. I pressed onward though, passing by one of the mounted candles ever so often. In between them, I was left in utter darkness, at the whim of my own footing. I took my time walking down them, adding to the anxiety to reach the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voices began to echo from the abyss below, bouncing off the walls. Once again, I could hear their monotone words being spoken in unison, still incomprehensible to me. In the darkness, the words were even more nerve-wrecking. It almost didn’t sound human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of the stairs brought me to a large chasm. A few candles were mounted on these walls as well, but they weren’t of much help. I could see their light reveal a set of different tunnels pointing in diverse directions. From here, it looked like I had to choose a path, but which one was right? If I chose wrong, I knew it would be nearly impossible to retrace my steps, especially in this darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices from earlier began to echo once again. Among the cave walls, they bounced all around, amplified by the acoustics. I focused on the sound, trying to pinpoint their origin. Finally after several minutes, I was able to determine that they were coming from the tunnel on the left, so I headed in that direction. The tunnel was completely dark, absent of candles. A few times I tripped on the rocky surface, but using the walls helped maintain my balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It continued to stretch onward. All I could see was an endless void in front of me. As I walked, I felt the urge to stop, feeling as if I would smack into a wall or something. All the while, the voices continued their chanting growing louder the more I pushed forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I reached an opening; it was glowing, all the while, producing a wave of heat. I came to a rocky perch; on the side, I could see another set of stone stairs curve down to the area below. I didn’t need to take them because the best gave a good overview of everything below. I crouched and moved closer to get a better view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I saw, would forever be burned in my mind. Below, I could see four individuals standing in a square formation, each facing inward. Four bowls containing an intense fire was set in between each of the individuals forming together some sort of a diamond. There were markings in red producing an arrangement of symbols and designs behind each of the figures. I noticed how all of them donned the same cloak and mask as I was wearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of them was slowly bobbing their heads, their hands clasped as if in prayer except one. The &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; was holding up a camcorder to film it all. Standing in the center, I saw a fifth person. This one wore a different cloak. It was pale white and more loosely fit than the others. The mask worn was black instead of white, almost as dark as the tunnel itself. If not for the light from the bowls, it would have looked like a faceless being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had to be the reverend. Each time he spoke out that strange language, the others would repeat it in unison. My eyes widened when I saw what was behind the reverend. There was a stone table covered with a white sheet, and on it I saw Victoria, clenching her stomach in pain. Every so often, she would let out a intense wail that filled the air. The white sheet underneath her was half-soaked in blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what? I didn’t know what to do now that I was here. Without warning, I was pulled from my thoughts when I felt something touch my shoulder. I spun around, almost screaming out loud. However, my eyes recognized the figure crouching behind me. It was the old woman, Victoria’s mother. She had followed me down here. She held up a finger to her lip and slowly crept passed me to look below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must stop this before it’s too late,” she whispered over her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How?” I asked. “What can we do? We can’t just rush down there without some sort of plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She nodded in agreement. “I know. We need to sprinkle this within their inner circle,” she said pulling out a small glass vial; it was filled with a clear liquid. “At the stage she’s in now, Victoria will need some of this on her as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s it?” I asked, sourly. “&lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; the plan?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” she replied, returning her gaze below. “Once this is sprinkled, I will need to recite my own incantation to cancel out the effects of their ritual. Only then will Victoria be saved and the rest of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shivered a little. “The world? You never did mention what would happen if that child was born,” I inquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing good, I assure you, but that will not happen,” she answered. “Listen, I have a plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was all ears to hearing it and leaned close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to draw them away from here so that I can conduct the incantation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How are we going to do that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A distraction, of course,” she replied, producing a twisted smile. “We&amp;rsquo;ll need their &lt;em&gt;undivided&lt;/em&gt; attention. I need to conduct the ceremony, so for that, we have to lead them away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed deeply. I really didn’t like this plan already, but it seemed like the only other option. After taking a few breaths, I stood up to announce my presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey!” I yelled out. It was all I could think to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, they went silent below, staring up at me. The light bounced off the faces of their twisted masks. Not one said a word, until the reverend spoke out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah Marcus, is that you?” he asked out-loud. “What a surprise it is to see ya&amp;rsquo; down here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“W-what the hell is going on here?” I stammered. “What are you fucks doing with Victoria?! You bastards better let her go or… or I’ll get the police involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverend chuckled, his mask bouncing a little. “Marcus,” he said softly, almost in a jokingly manner. “When ya&amp;rsquo; first arrived, I will admit I thought I understood everythin&amp;rsquo; about you, just from our first conversation. At the time, you looked like nothin&amp;rsquo; more, but a stammering piglet that had gone astray. You couldn’t even get your words right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see the others slowly moving away from their spots, edging their way to the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But then ya&amp;rsquo; surprised me with your bold antics. You sneaked into our congregation room, attempted to steal one of my member’s rings, yes I know about that,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes lit up. How could he have known?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ya&amp;rsquo; even warmed up to Victoria, convincin&amp;rsquo; her to leave all this and her family behind,” he finished. “Now, that my boy, is something. Tell me, I know you’re sick of seein&amp;rsquo; everyone suffer, like your grandfather or even your mother that passed away when you were young.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was dumbstruck. How did he know all of this? He couldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued. “All those people out there in world as well – suffering, doing so unnecessarily, and for what reason, but for what &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; wants,” he said, pointing upward. “With Lanius though, we can &lt;em&gt;reshape&lt;/em&gt; this world. He’ll reshape everything in &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; image and erase all that pain and all that sufferin&amp;rsquo;. Everything will be set right, the way it should be. Why not be willin&amp;rsquo; to join him in this transformation?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see the other members drawing closer up the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Think about it, Marcus. Are we really that bad of people? Look at yourself, what have ya&amp;rsquo; really believed in that you could hold on to?” he continued. “Join us down here, be a part of that new world, a new direction. You’re already halfway there; ya’ve got what you need on ya&amp;rsquo; right now. So why not come down the path fully?” he said, lifting his hands up. “Victoria’s sufferin&amp;rsquo; right now, but when this all over, she won’t anymore. Ya&amp;rsquo; can even be with her in the new world, it’s what ya&amp;rsquo; want, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes glanced over at Victoria, still gasping in pain. Her eyes clenched painfully shut. I listened as she let out another horrific wail. I see could an impression of something moving around in her, pressing upward against her skin. My voice was lost; I was unable to say anything. This bastard was crazy, they all were. However, if that was truly the case, why was I so hesitant? Was there a part of me that wanted this, that believed in this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, the old woman stood up to reveal herself too. &amp;ldquo;Poisonous words never fail to excrete from your mouth, you sniveling snake!&amp;rdquo; she hissed at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who is that up there with ya&amp;rsquo;, Marcus?&amp;rdquo; he asked calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who do you think, you foul bastard?&amp;rdquo; she barked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carolina?&amp;rdquo; he said, surprised. &amp;ldquo;I must admit, I am a bit shocked to see ya&amp;rsquo; still &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt;. I must ask how ya&amp;rsquo; managed to escape the gaze of Lanius?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmph, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you like to know? You&amp;rsquo;re not the only one who can conjure up a spell or two,&amp;rdquo; she snapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right,&amp;rdquo; he said unfazed. &amp;ldquo;Ya&amp;rsquo; always were an unpredictable one, Carolina. I truly was heartbroken when I learned ya&amp;rsquo; weren&amp;rsquo;t fully on board with us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She scoffed at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, Marcus. What will it be?&amp;rdquo; he asked, returning his attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glanced over to see the old woman’s eyes gleaming at me from the shadows. She shook her head in dismay, mouthing something softly. I couldn’t hear the words, but I could make out the last word escaping her lips: &amp;ldquo;lies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said softly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come again?” the reverend asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said no, you Satanic fucks!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighed, dropping his arms. “That’s too bad, son.” He gestured with his head to the others who immediately sprang up the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Move it!&amp;rdquo; the old woman yelled, bolting down the tunnel we had entered from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised she was even able to move at such speed. Without wasting time, I quickly hurried behind her. I could hear their footsteps echoing following us. I didn’t know where I was going; there nothing but endless void before me. I felt my feet trip again a few times as I went. My lungs were burning, begging me to stop, but the adrenaline pumping through me must have kept me going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we reached the original chasm with all the tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We need to split them up. Try to lose them in the best manner you can,&amp;rdquo; she said in deep breaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was half out of breath myself, barely catching what she said. Without hesitation, she ran off to the tunnel on the left. I took the hint and darted down the nearest one to my right. On the inside, I hoped that I had not chosen one with a dead-end. The tunnel itself was very tight. I felt the sharp edges of the walls scrape against my arms a few times, but I pressed onward. Thinking quickly, I pulled out my phone using its light to help guide the way. Ahead of me, my eyes made out what I had dreaded would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had reached a dead-end. “Shit!” I yelled out. There was no way I could turn around, not if they were following me. However, I was surprised to find that the wall wasn’t like the tunnel&amp;rsquo;s uneven texture. Looking closer, it appeared be a type of &lt;em&gt;door&lt;/em&gt;. It was still made of stone, but it was smooth and had markings engraved along it. I couldn’t make them out, but the phone on my light revealed a familiar sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see a small indent with a symbol etched within; it was similar to that of the one for the Congregation room&amp;rsquo;s doors. “The finger,” I thought out-loud. I reached in my pocket trying to find it. Behind me, I could hear the clapping of footsteps gaining on me. I struggled to pull the damn thing out. When I did, I pressed it up against the indent and twisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, nothing happened, but soon the door began to move. A loud moan was produced from it as it lifted slowly upwards. I could hear the footsteps getting closer, but the door was still at my ankles. I yelled and cursed at the damn thing to hurry until at last it was up to my chest; it was good enough for me. I was ready to bolt through the opening when suddenly I was tackled from behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The force from the tackle sent me forward along with my attacker. We both rolled into the room sliding away from each other. I landed crudely, banging my knee and elbow in the process. It wasn’t until I looked up that I caught the scent of something putrid in the air. The room we had entered was colder than the other areas and seemed to be darker. My impaired vision must have amplified my sense of smell because I was completely appalled by it. It was if something had been decaying or rather &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; things had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under my hand, I felt something hard poke me. I couldn’t see the object clearly, but I felt how smooth it was, almost too perfect. Around it, I felt other objects with the same feeling. I wanted to use my cellphone, but I couldn’t find it, clearly dropped from the fall. I did, however, hear a man grunting, apparently my attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ya&amp;rsquo; little shit, I knew ya&amp;rsquo;d be trouble from the start,” I heard him say. The voice sounded like Terrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear him standing up. His breathing was still rapid from the chase. My heart leapt into my throat. I tried to be extra careful while I rose to my feet hoping to not draw his attention. If he was like me, then it was impossible to see anything in this darkness. If quiet enough, I could probably sneak past him. I started moving forward, taking small steps while I listened for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The reverend told me about the ring. Ya&amp;rsquo; thought were slick about it all, huh?!&amp;rdquo; he yelled out, his voice echoed. &amp;ldquo;Ya&amp;rsquo; see, the reverend knows all &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; sees all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear his footsteps pacing around. The acoustics of the room made it hard to pinpoint his exact position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then ya&amp;rsquo; stole one of our tomes, but I found it,&amp;rdquo; he continued. &amp;ldquo;I was glad ya&amp;rsquo; did though. Ya&amp;rsquo; got to see what&amp;rsquo;s coming to that bitch. I hope ya&amp;rsquo; enjoyed every last of it,&amp;rdquo; he said, chuckling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what came over me after that. After hearing those disgusting words, I somehow managed to find and pounce on Terrance in an immense rage. I didn’t hesitate and swung where I thought his head was, striking a hard surface. I yelled out in pain. It was his mask that I struck. He laughed, rendering a strong blow into my stomach. I felt the wind painfully rip its way from my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, he pushed me away which sent me falling on my back. I felt the sting from something hard press itself against beneath me. I reached behind for the object and my eyes lit up. Immediately after, his hands grabbed at my legs to pull me close. Still in pain, I kicked at him and pulled out the object from below. I cocked it, aimed in his direction and pulled the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flash of light lit up the entire area for a split second followed by a loud bang. The noise echoed throughout the chasm and beyond. That flash of light was enough for me to locate my phone. I grabbed at it, pushed a button and aimed it in front of me. I could see Terrance in the illumination gripping his arm in pain. The blood from his wound dripped to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You little…” he started, but croaked in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gun shook in my hand. This was the first time I had ever shot one before, let alone at a person. I didn’t get time to decide what to do next. There was a deep growl that filled the air and echoed all around us. The ground almost felt like it was trembling. Further back in the room, I could hear something twisting around. Its movements were crackly and heavy. The odor from earlier grew stronger, flooding my nose even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shit! It’s awake!” I heard Terrance scream out. He turned to leave. Yet, before I could even blink, I felt a large rush of wind race past me. The smell of its odor lingered behind it. Whatever it was, it was &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; and it was huge. The next thing I heard was it pounding on Terrance. I could hear it ripping into him and tearing pieces apart. His screams flooded the air - a blood-curdling shrill so intense that it drew tears from my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear the thing continue to tear at him, cracking bones as it did. Somehow, I managed to find the feeling in my legs and bolted out of the room. Behind me, I heard the thing let out a frightening roar. I didn’t stop running though, pushing as hard I could through the tight walls. I could hear its heavy footsteps pounding behind me. The snarls from its breathing grew closer in my ear. It was gaining quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without thinking, I aimed the gun behind me and fired off a few rounds. It wasn’t until after the third round that I heard another loud roar. The footsteps behind immediately came to a halt. I continued running until I reached the open area once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was out of breath, but I knew I couldn’t stop. That thing was sure to continue its pursuit soon so I couldn’t waste any time. Before I could fully gain my composure, I heard footsteps heading in my direction. They weren’t from the tunnel behind me, but ahead. I quickly readied my gun, ready to fire again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three figures emerged from the darkness racing frantically. It was the other church members. I had already fired four bullets which meant I only had two left. There were three of them so I would have to decide carefully who I wanted to shoot. They came to a halt in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Marcus,&amp;rdquo; I heard Margaret&amp;rsquo;s voice speak out from the three. &amp;ldquo;Have you finally stopped running?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Back the fuck off!&amp;rdquo; I yelled, the gun still pointing at them. &amp;ldquo;If I have to, I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; kill you crazy bastards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard one of them giggle. It must have been Sophia. They slowly began edging their way towards me. I backed up a little, keeping the gun trained on them. I started to shift to the side hoping to align the next tunnel to my back. It was clear this gun was doing nothing for me. I probably would only have enough time to shoot one before the others rushed in. I would need to be quick so I could make a run for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come now, Marcus. Have you realized it yet? You really think we invited you all the way out here just to install some silly computers?&amp;rdquo; Margaret began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stunned when I heard this. &amp;ldquo;What the hell are you talking about? Why else would I be here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She chuckled. &amp;ldquo;We needed a legitimate reason to get you out here and &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; you are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t even know who I am,&amp;rdquo; I said. She was clearly talking nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is that what you think? I&amp;rsquo;m surprised none of this appears familiar to you. You have after all been down this path before,&amp;rdquo; she continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hands slowly lowered the gun. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but a small portion of me believed, even if it did sound ludicrous. &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Lanius, he&amp;rsquo;s always had a fascination with you,&amp;rdquo; she answered. &amp;ldquo;Something about you, he&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; she started to say, but trailed in her words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What about me?&amp;rdquo; I demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she could answer, a large figure bolted from the shadows, pouncing on Margaret. It was that horrid creature from earlier; it had caught up. Now among the dim candlelight, I could make out more of its features. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wished those candles weren&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the poor lighting, I could see its thin elongated arms with sharp talons for fingers. Massive horns extended from its back. Its loose wild hair fell across its crude snout of a face. Its blood-colored eyes glowed, piercing the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched as it began tearing into Margaret as it had Terrance. With each new sound of splitting flesh came a louder shrill from her. Her loud cries bounced off the walls, extending throughout the tunnels. The others attempted to flee, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t get far. The creature was merciless, pouncing on them and tearing into them in the same manner. Suddenly, I felt a harsh tug on my arm pulling me down the tunnel behind. It was the old woman. I didn’t know where she came from, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t question her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tormenting screams of the others continued to resonate in the air. The burning pain in my lungs returned, as we turned and ran. The old woman yelled back not to stop; I could hear the struggle in her voice as well to maintain the pace. There seemed to be no end to the tunnel. It felt like we were running in place, making no progress. In the midst of my exhaustion, I felt my foot drag, causing me to lose my balance. I fell hard, slamming onto my already injured knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Get up! Get up, now!&amp;rdquo; the old woman screamed at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried but struggled to do so, caught in the blend of pain and exhaustion. I tried to pull myself up using the wall. Behind me, I could hear the rapid thumping of large footsteps once again. I could feel the old woman help me up. She threw my arm over her shoulder and began assisting me forward. However, it was too late. We could feel the gaze emanating from the creature behind us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our eyes must have fully adjusted in the dark because I could clearly make out its massive form. Its hot breath blew across our faces, the smell of fresh blood lingering in it. The old woman pushed me away. &amp;ldquo;Run now,&amp;rdquo; she said softly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?!&amp;rdquo; I replied in shock. &amp;ldquo;No we have to stick together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, you must go. I will hold it off,&amp;rdquo; she stated firmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go!&amp;rdquo; she roared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her voice startled me. I quickly turned and began hobbling away. Behind me, I could still hear her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You foul demon. You think you&amp;rsquo;ve won?&amp;rdquo; she stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature rendered a harsh snarl in return. I could hear her begin to recite strange words in another language. The creature sounded affected, screaming loud roars of pain. Whatever she was saying, it was clearly working. I paused to look back, just making out their faint outlines in the dark. I wondered if what she was doing was actually going to stop it. However, I saw the creature swing one of its long arms at her. Her body flew against the wall producing a sickening crack. Her words instantly died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after, I could hear the thing ripping away at her. The blow must’ve have been enough to kill her because she didn&amp;rsquo;t yell in pain. I went from hopping aggressively on one foot to a full fledge run. I ignored the pain from my knee, feeling fear and adrenaline engulfing me. Up ahead, I could see a light from the end. I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time until that thing would continue its pursuit for me. I reached the opening, revealing the original ritual area I had first come across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hesitant in approaching the perch, but I did so, looking down. Victoria was still down there. Based on her increased wails, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be long before she gave birth. I saw no trace of the reverend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my way down the stairs, approaching the symbols surrounding Victoria. Up close, I could tell they were made from blood. The bowls were still blazing. The heat from them was intense, forcing sweat down my face. When I approached Victory, her eyes fell upon me. I could see the fear returning in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;S-stay&amp;hellip; the fuck away from me!&amp;rdquo; she yelled, struggling with words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taken back at this, but then I remembered I was still wearing the mask. I quickly removed it and was relieved to see her eyes light up upon seeing my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marcus?&amp;rdquo; she gasped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m here Victoria,&amp;rdquo; I answered, rushing to her side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tears formed in her eyes. &amp;ldquo;Marcus&amp;hellip; p-please&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; she stopped in mid sentence, rendering another wail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She continued screaming. I could hear her vocals become rasp from the strain. I didn’t know what to do. A massive lump moved around her stomach uncontrollably, pressing up against her skin. I didn’t think it was possible, but her screams grew even louder. I felt completely useless right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when I thought it couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any worse, I heard a familiar roar from above. The creature from earlier had returned. I could see its burning red eyes beaming down from the perch. It leapt from the top, landing with a loud thud. Its disturbing form was hunched over, breathing a rapid rhythm exalting a snarl in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now fully in the light, I felt my stomach tighten at its appearance. The thought of the statue came to my mind. This thing was almost a spitting image of it, but only worse. Its face was more disturbing in person with its blackened humanoid-dog features. The nose atop its snout appeared caved-in, flaring with its breathing. Its eyes were beady, completely dyed a crimson red. Atop its forehead, it held a large closed eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood in between Victoria and the beast. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to let this thing do anything to her. I raised the gun up ready to fire waiting for it to make a move. Yet, that was it, it did &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. It just stood there, breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come on!&amp;rdquo; I yelled, trying to provoke it. &amp;ldquo;Do it! Come at me, you sick fuck!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did nothing still. Instead, the edge of its lips curled up into a twisted smile. I felt a shiver roll down my spine. The damn thing was smiling at me. I was ready to fire the gun, but then I noticed the bullet holes on it from where it had been previously hit. Two of the bullets had managed to hit it, but they stuck out of its wounds barely penetrating it. It was useless; the gun did nothing to it. Realizing this, I lowered it, eventually letting it drop to the ground. When I did, its smile grew wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What the hell are you?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That, my boy,&amp;quot; I heard the reverend&amp;rsquo;s voice answer out loud, &amp;ldquo;is Lanius, the White Eye of Time.” I could hear it behind me, but I didn’t dare break my eyes away from the creature. &amp;ldquo;He will become this world&amp;rsquo;s new master,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was speechless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ya&amp;rsquo; will witness his rebirth into this world, Marcus. He will reshape it in his image. Now, witness it,&amp;rdquo; the reverend went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if on cue, the creature began to roar into the air. I could see the rows of its blood covered teeth extend deep back into its throat. It felt as if the whole room was rumbling. Suddenly, it collapsed onto the ground, lying motionless. I was confused. Did it just die? If it did, what killed it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victoria broke the silence, screaming at a level a human shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have possibly reached. The form within her moved around vigorously, eventually tearing its way free. Blood flew in all directions, some splattering across me. My eyes turned to see a blood soaked creature wallowing around in the remains of Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked to be the size of a dog. I could see the sharp talons from one of its lanky arms cling to the side of the table. Curling horns protruded from its head, entangled in the wild strands of its hair. It sniffed the air for awhile before turning its attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt tears forming in my eyes. Immediately, I felt my stomach give-in, hurling to the side. It hurt because I had already done so earlier and there was nothing left to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaning over the mess I produced, I could only think of one thing. &amp;ldquo;Victoria,&amp;rdquo; I whispered. In the end, I couldn’t do anything but watch her suffer. She trusted me to save her, and I failed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature looked like a miniature version of its previous self. However, its third eye was open this time. It was completely white, void of pupil, blinking asynchronously to its smaller ones. Despite having no pupil, I could feel its white eye gazing upon me. My head began buzzing starting as a simple vibration. The vibration escalated into an immense outpour of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see images in my head. They were images of places in the world, of people. The people were screaming for their lives. The sky above them was black, the streets littered with thousands of bodies lying lifeless and torn to pieces. Fires were brewing over damaged cars with half burnt corpses sitting in their seats. Faces of horrendous beings, too atrocious to describe were seen everywhere tearing away at those unable to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images flooded my head. I was at the mercy of them as the pain increased the more they appeared. Tears fell endlessly from my eyes. Why was I being shown these horrible things? Just when I thought I couldn’t take anymore, they stopped. I slumped over still feeling my head throb. I could still see their faces, hear their screams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did ya&amp;rsquo; see it, Marcus? Did ya&amp;rsquo; see the dream he produced in yer mind?” the reverend asked. He walked from the shadows into the light. He slowly removed the mask from his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;W-what the&amp;hellip; what the hell was that?&amp;rdquo; I asked. I could still feel lingering amounts of the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It took many years to prepare this revitalization. First, he had to get stronger and to do so he needed a vessel to use. I too, was frightened when I first laid eyes upon him, but he showed me his intentions. From then, I was enlightened,&amp;rdquo; he explained. &amp;ldquo;He speaks to me with his white eye. That’s how I knew everythin&amp;rsquo; about ya&amp;rsquo; back there. I’m sure he gave ya&amp;rsquo; a glimpse of the paradise to be,” he continued, walking up to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Paradise?” I repeated, still in a daze. &amp;ldquo;Is that what the fuck you&amp;rsquo;re calling that?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Lanius will reshape this world into his image. Imagine sweet blue skies, endless green pastures with trees flowing abundantly with scrumptious fruit. No more pain. No more suffering. A true renewed &amp;lsquo;Eden&amp;rsquo;. I know its hard to conceive all of this - how could we in the current world we live in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;His power is beyond our understandin&amp;rsquo;, but it can open the ripples of time. He can alter what he likes, &lt;em&gt;insert&lt;/em&gt; what he likes. With it, he can return to the past of the vessel he chooses. Each time, he possesses the younger self, growing with them until they become of age. Doing it repeatedly makes him stronger. When he finally reaches fruition, he needs to be born of human flesh,” he went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Victoria?” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Correct. Now, is that time, Marcus. Once he does it again, this will be the last. He will be permanently infuse with his new vessel,” he answered, revealing his twisted toothy smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You?&amp;rdquo; I asked, still feeling the throb in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Come now, Marcus. I&amp;rsquo;ve merely been a humble servant, ensuring everything was arranged properly for his rebirth. Lanius has always been interested in &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. Ya&amp;rsquo; recall the pages of the tome, yes? Who do think that was with Lanius?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook my head in disbelief. It didn’t make sense. There was no way it could&amp;rsquo;ve been me. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re lying. That&amp;rsquo;s impossible. If so, why me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll ya&amp;rsquo; see, Marcus. Lanius sees all aspects of time, all possibilities. Out of everyone, he saw ya&amp;rsquo; to be the best candidate to lead to the outcome he desired. Ya&amp;rsquo; should feel honored,&amp;rdquo; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand,&amp;rdquo; I replied. &amp;ldquo;You said he&amp;rsquo;s always been using me, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recall any of those times at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well of course ya&amp;rsquo; don&amp;rsquo;t, Marcus,&amp;rdquo; he said, smiling. &amp;ldquo;Each time, Lanius removed yer memory after transferrin&amp;rsquo; to yer younger body. Believe it or not, we&amp;rsquo;ve already had this conversation before. I only recall because he &lt;em&gt;allows&lt;/em&gt; me to. Ya&amp;rsquo; see, I&amp;rsquo;m the one ensurin&amp;rsquo; everything goes as planned accordingly. Ya&amp;rsquo;ll go back as ya&amp;rsquo;ve done before, but this time, it&amp;rsquo;ll be for good. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to say though, what is left of Marcus Pale will be no more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself shaking my head again. I couldn’t believe it, didn&amp;rsquo;t want to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please, Marcus,&amp;rdquo; he continued. &amp;ldquo;Each time, we go through this little charade. I try to give ya&amp;rsquo; a chance to let ya&amp;rsquo; willingly come forward, but as always, ya&amp;rsquo; fight it. How about switchin&amp;rsquo; it up for a change and give-in. It is inevitable regardless,&amp;rdquo; he finished. &amp;ldquo;What will it be, Marcus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remained in silence, trying absorb everything. It was too much. How could it all possibly be true? There was no way of telling otherwise. It seemed like a lose-lose situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I started to answer, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re full of shit,&amp;rdquo; I said, rendering a light smirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes seemed to twitch with dissatisfaction. “How very disappointin&amp;rsquo;,” he said, turning his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see his hand move into his cloak. He turned around producing a gun in his hand. He fired the weapon missing me. I quickly threw myself to the ground, grabbing my own gun. I pointed and shot off a round just he did. His shot grazed my side, only pirecing my cloak. My shot, however, had hit him in the leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fell to the ground. Immediately, he proceeded to lift his gun, struggling to aim it at me. I walked over to him keeping my own pointed at him. Standing over him, I held it to his face. He smiled at me before dropping his own in defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ya&amp;rsquo; think this hasn&amp;rsquo;t already happened, Marcus? It&amp;rsquo;s inevitable,” he said. The smile grew wider on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t answer and simply pulled back on the trigger. His body immediately went limp. I remained over him with the gun still pointing at it. I never thought killing someone would be so satisfying. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like this thought though. There was something about this place, whatever it was I was ready to leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, I felt the same painful pulse from early flood my head. I fell to my knees gripping my head. When I turned, I could see the creature crawl from the table, dragging its deformed, limp legs. It snarled at me moving close in speed. I held the gun in my hand and pulled the trigger, but it only clicked. I repeated the action only to receive the same result: it was empty. Quickly, I reached over with my other hand and grabbed the reverend’s gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it was too late; the thing pounced on me. Its slimy hands gripped my neck. I could feel its hot putrid breath on my face and see pieces of flesh clung to it jagged teeth. I wanted to throw the damn thing off, but I could feel the pain in my head amplify. It was hard to describe, but I could feel its presence within my mind. It was like it was searching for something. It wasn’t until the last minute that I could visually see what it had found. Immediately, we both were engulfed into a blinding light out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the light cleared, I found myself lying in something cold. When I stood to my feet, I realized that it was snow. There was snow everywhere. Where was I? I looked around seeing cars covered in snow as well. Several buildings loomed around me all with something in common: decorations. They all had reeves and lights either on their doors or around the buildings. Christmas? How could that be, it was July?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about this area was familiar, but I didn’t know why. The building before me was fairly tall, maybe four stories. Something about it drew me towards it. Through the glass, I could see my reflection. I could see that horrifying mask over my face. How did it get back on my face? I also noticed both of the guns still in my hands. I can&amp;rsquo;t describe it, but I felt lightheaded. I could hardly recall what I had been doing prior to arriving here. In fact, I didn’t even remember where I got this cloak from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt the urge to enter the building. I tucked the guns away and entered. Inside, I noticed several closed doors along with a staircase to the side. This must have been an apartment building. I couldn’t pulled myself from this feeling, letting it take me to the stairs. I began climbing, passing more doors on each floor, each with their own set of reeves or anything Christmas related. With each floor, I tried searching for some hint of why I was here. I continued upward until reaching the third floor. I was led to a door on the left marked: 3-A. Why was I brought here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt my hand lift as if it had a mind of its own. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t gain control over it. It banged on the door. Inside, I could hear someone moving towards the entrance. Next, I felt my hand reach back into my cloak, pulling out the revolver. Fear filled my eyes. Why was I grabbing the gun? I wanted to warn the person inside to not to open their door, but my mouth wouldn’t obey either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my horror, I listened as the bolt unlocked and the door opened. My eyes could not comprehend the sight before me. The person in front of me was my father. He looked very young more so than the last time I saw him, but it was him. How was this possible? Without warning, my hand struck him across the face. Next my leg kicked him back. The woman inside gave off an ear-splitting scream in shock. It was the young face of my &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; mother. She was &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;, but how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apartment was heavily decorated to suit the Christmas atmosphere. It had a tree nicely decorated with presents piled underneath. I couldn’t help, but feel a sense of familiarity to what was transpiring before me. Again, my hand moved without command, shutting the door and locking the bolt. It pointed the gun at my parents, fear engulfing their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why are you doing this?&amp;rdquo; my father asked, gripping his head. &amp;ldquo;What do you want?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to answer, but could not. To my side, I heard a soft voice. I looked over and saw a young child playing with a book: it was me. I was actually in the presence of my younger self. I felt a strong force vibrating through my head, feeling it filter out. It was odd, but it looked almost like the fumes of gasoline flowing towards my younger self. It suddenly hit me. I felt a partial memory return. I recalled the words of the reverend. This was happening to me because of that thing, Lanius. It was inside me, controlling my actions. It needed to take over my younger self for its vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could feel its presence vacating my body watching it flood into my younger self. My parents probably couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it, only me. I couldn’t let this happen. I was not about to become one with this thing for the rest of my life. Concentrating, I attempted to move my hand. The one with the gun was solid and unmovable. The finger in that hand began moving on its own accord. I could feel it tighten on the trigger. The gun was still aimed at my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was it doing this? Why was it trying to kill my mother in the process? I made every attempt to stop my hand, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t listen. I was ready to give-in until my mind had another lapse in memory. I recalled having a dream. It was similar to what was happening now, but slightly different though. I tried to focus, attempting to recall more of the dream. For some reason, it was so hard to do so. I didn’t know why, but it felt necessary to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More pieces began to come together. In the dream, I saw myself fire the gun, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t at my mother. No, I shot myself, the younger me. It was puzzling that I was did this. Another piece of the dream came to me. There was a bright light and in the light was a face. I could recall the face this time; it was the smiling face of my mother. She was completely encased in the light as if the source of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I understood everything. I knew what I needed to do. I attempted to concentrate on my other hand, focusing on the image of it moving to my command hoping the thought would render it. I could gradually feel my control returning. Somehow the more the creature left me, the more I gained feeling in my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I concentrated on moving my arm, feeling its mobility. With it, I reached down into my cloak and felt around until I recognized the object. I pulled out the second gun, aiming it at my younger self. My mother before me let out a loud shriek when she saw this. I could feel parts of my arm wanting to drop the gun, but I fought against it, aiming at the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature must’ve have picked up on my plan because it started to flood images through my head again. This time they were of people that I had known or would come to know: my friends, my loved ones, everyone. It was like it was trying to get me to understand the consequences if I continued with my action. I could see its fumes attempting to pump faster into my younger body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I saw the last of them completely enter my younger self. My one-year old self stared at me innocently. This moment had made sense now. I could picture the dream that brought me into all of this. This foul creature had controlled me for the last time. All this time, it had been &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; who had been the executioner of my own mother. I was the monster, the crazy loon that had broken in all those years ago. No, he &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; me that crazy loon. He altered time. I was the closest person to help him realize his plan. However, the creature probably saw in all the infinite possibilities of time that my mother was the only threat to its plans. I laughed to myself. It was ironic that even in death she found a way to warn me, providing an escape route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanius’ own tearing through time and space and had backfired. In its own attempt to fulfil its ambition, it ended up creating its own demise. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop the human spirit; it was powerless to love. My mother&amp;rsquo;s interference was like what the reverend had said verbatim: inevitable. I smiled to myself, squeezing back on the trigger. The bullet pierced through the child&amp;rsquo;s skull, instantly dropping him. Now dead, I could feel the control of my body return. It was as if a heavy aura of weight lifted from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sighing deeply, I dropped the gun to the ground. Slowly, I removed the mask from my face, looking over at my parents. They were silent with eyes still fixated on their dead child. Finally, my mother turned her gaze to me. I smiled at her, watching her eyes grow wide at seeing my face. With tears forming in my eyes, I could feel a hint of pain growing across my forehead. Something warm began to run down my nose. My eyes looked deep into my mother&amp;rsquo;s as I spoke several words, “I’m sorry… I had to. I… I did you a favor. Forgive me…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve intentionally withheld some details from a lot of my stories. I&amp;rsquo;ve let my hopes concerning the way things might influence my evaluation of the way they actually are. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any point to that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the summer between Kindergarten and first grade I caught the stomach flu. This has all of the components of the regular flu; however, with the stomach flu, you throw up in a bucket and not the toilet because you are sitting on it&amp;mdash;the sickness gets purged from both ends. This lasted for about ten days, but just before it had passed the sickness was granted an extension in the form of pink eye. My eyelids were so fused together by the dried mucus generated during the night that the first day I awoke with the infection I thought I had gone blind. When I started first grade, I had a kink in my neck from ten days of bed-rest and two swollen, bloodshot eyes. Josh was in another Group and didn&amp;rsquo;t have my lunch, so in a cafeteria bursting with two-hundred kids, I still had a table to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started keeping spare food in my backpack that I would take into the bathroom to eat after lunch since my school meals were usually confiscated by older kids who knew I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stand up to them since no one would stand with me. This dynamic persisted even after my condition cleared up since no one wants to be friends with the kid who gets bullied, lest they have some of that aggression directed toward themselves. The only reason this stopped was due to the actions of a kid named Alex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex was in the third grade and was bigger than most of the other kids in any grade. Around the third week of school, he started sitting with me at lunch, and this put an immediate end to the shortage of my food supply. He was nice enough, but he seemed kind of slow; we never really talked at length except for when I finally decided to ask why he had been sitting with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a crush on Josh&amp;rsquo;s sister, Veronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veronica was in fourth grade and was probably the prettiest girl in the school. Even as a six-year-old who fully endorsed the notion that girls were disgusting, I still knew how pretty Veronica was. When she was in third grade, Josh told me, two boys had actually gotten into a physical fight which erupted out of an argument concerning the significance of the messages she had written in their yearbooks. One of the boys eventually hit the other in the forehead with the corner of the yearbook and the wound required stitches to close. While not one of those two boys, Alex wanted her to like him and confessed that he knew Josh and I were best friends; I gathered that he had hoped that I would convey his ostensibly philanthropic deed to Veronica and that she would presumably be so moved by his selflessness that she&amp;rsquo;d take an interest in him. If I told her he would continue to sit with me for as long as I needed him to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this was during the time when Josh mostly stayed at my house building the raft and navigating tributary with me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to bring it up to Veronica because I simply didn&amp;rsquo;t see her. I told Josh about it and he made fun of Alex, but said that he would tell his sister since I wanted him to. I doubted that he would. Josh was annoyed that people seemed to be so taken with his sister. I remember him calling her an ugly crow. I never said anything to Josh, but I remember wanting to say, even then, that she was pretty and would one day be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was fifteen, I was seeing a movie at a place my friends and I had come to call the Dirt Theatre. It was probably nice at some point, but time and neglect had weathered the place severely. This theatre had movable tables and chairs on a level floor, so when the theatre was full, there were very few places you could sit and see the whole screen. The theatre was still open, I imagine, for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was cheap to see a movie there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they showed a different cult movie twice a month at midnight; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they sold beer to underage kids during the midnight showings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for the first two, and that night they were showing &lt;em&gt;Scanners&lt;/em&gt; by David Cronenberg for $1.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends and I were sitting in the very back. I wanted to sit closer to the front for a better view, but Ryan had driven us so I relented. A couple minutes before the movie started, a group of girls walked in. They were all pretty attractive, but whatever beauty they might have had was eclipsed by the girl with the dirty blonde hair, even though I had only caught a glimpse of her profile. As she turned to move her seat, I caught a full view of her face which gave me the feeling of butterflies in my stomach&amp;mdash;it was Veronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen her in a long time. Josh and I saw progressively less of one another after we snuck out to my old house that night when we were ten, and usually when I&amp;rsquo;d visit him she&amp;rsquo;d be out with friends. While everyone stared at the screen, I stared at Veronica&amp;mdash;only looking away when the feeling that I was being a creep overcame me, but that feeling would quickly subside and my eyes would return to her. She really was beautiful, just like I had thought she&amp;rsquo;d be when I was a kid. When the credits started to roll my friends got up and left; there was only one exit and they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be trapped waiting for the crowd to clear. I lingered in hopes of catching Veronica&amp;rsquo;s attention. As she and her friends walked by I took a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, Veronica.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned toward me looking a little startled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out of my seat and stepped a little into the light coming in through the open door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s me. Josh&amp;rsquo;s old friend from way back&amp;hellip; How&amp;hellip; How&amp;rsquo;ve you been?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh my god! HEY! It&amp;rsquo;s been so long!&amp;rdquo; she motioned to her friends that she&amp;rsquo;d be out in a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, a few years at least! Not since the last time I stayed over with Josh. How is he, anyway?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s right. I remember all you guys&amp;rsquo; games. Do you still play Ninja Turtles with your friends?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She laughed a little and I blushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No. I&amp;rsquo;m not a kid anymore&amp;hellip; Me and my friends play X-men now.&amp;rdquo; I was really hoping she&amp;rsquo;d laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did. &amp;ldquo;Haha! You&amp;rsquo;re cute. Do you come to these movies every time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still reeling from what she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does she really think I&amp;rsquo;m cute? Did she just mean I was funny? Does she think I&amp;rsquo;m attractive?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suddenly realized that she had asked me a question, and my mind grasped for what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;YEAH!&amp;rdquo; I said much too loudly. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I try to anyway&amp;hellip; what about you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I come every now and then. My boyfriend didn&amp;rsquo;t like these movies but we just broke up so I plan on coming from now on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to be casual, but failed. &amp;ldquo;Oh, well that&amp;rsquo;s cool&amp;hellip; not that you guys broke up! I just meant that you&amp;rsquo;d be able to come more often.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She laughed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to recover, &amp;ldquo;So are you coming the week after next? They&amp;rsquo;re supposed to show &lt;em&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s really cool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll be here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled, and I was about to suggest that maybe we could sit together when she quickly closed the space between us and hugged me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was really good to see you,&amp;rdquo; she said with her arms around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to think of what to say when I realized the biggest problem was that I had forgotten how to talk. Luckily Ryan, who I could hear approaching from the hallway, came in and spoke for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dude. You know the movie&amp;rsquo;s over right? Let&amp;rsquo;s get the fuck outtu&amp;mdash; OHHH YEAAHHH.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veronica let go and said that she&amp;rsquo;d see me next time. She was played out of the room by the porn music Ryan was making with his mouth. I was furious, but it dissipated as soon as I heard Veronica laughing in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; couldn&amp;rsquo;t come soon enough. Ryan&amp;rsquo;s family was going out of town so he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to drive us, and the other friends I was with that night didn&amp;rsquo;t have cars. A couple of days before the movie I asked my mom if she could take me. She responded almost immediately by denying my request, but I persisted and she picked up on the desperation in my voice. She asked why I wanted to go so badly since I had seen the movie before and I hesitated before saying that I was hoping to see a girl there. She smiled and asked playfully if she knew the girl and I reluctantly told her it was Veronica. The smile disappeared from her face and she coldly said &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I would call Veronica to see if she could pick me up. I had no idea if she still lived at home, but it was worth a try. But then I realized that Josh might answer. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t talked to him in almost three years, and if he answered I obviously couldn&amp;rsquo;t ask to talk to his sister. I felt guilty for calling to speak with Veronica and not Josh, but I dismissed that feeling quickly; Josh hadn&amp;rsquo;t called me in years either. I picked up the phone and dialed the number that was still embedded in my muscle memory from having dialed it so often all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rang several times before someone picked up. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t Josh. I felt a mixture of both relief and disappointment&amp;mdash;I realized in that second that I really missed Josh. I would call after this weekend and talk to him, but this was my only chance to see if Veronica could or would take me so I asked for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person told me I had dialed the wrong number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeated the number back to her, and she confirmed. She said they must have changed their number and I agreed. I apologized for the disturbance and hung up. I was suddenly intensely sad because now I couldn&amp;rsquo;t contact Josh even if I wanted to; I felt terrible for having been afraid that he might answer the phone. He had been my very best friend. I realized that the only way I could be put back in touch with him would be through Veronica, so now, not that I needed one, I had another reason to see her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told my mom the day before the movie that I was no longer concerned with going, but was hoping she could drop me off at my friend Chris&amp;rsquo; house. She relented and dropped me off that Saturday a couple of hours before the movie. My plan was to walk from his house to the theatre since he only lived about a half-mile away. They went to church early on Sundays so his parents would go to sleep early Saturday night, and Chris was fine with not coming with me since he had planned on chatting with this girl he met online. He said that the walk back to his house would be even lonelier after she laughed in my face when I tried to kiss her, and I told him not to electrocute himself when he tried to have sex with his computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left his house at 11:15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to pace myself so I&amp;rsquo;d get there just a little before the movie. I was going by myself and so I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to just hang around there waiting. On the way to the theatre I figured that if Veronica showed up at all it would be too lucky for us to arrive at the same time, so I debated whether I should wait outside or just go in. Both had their pros and cons. As I was grappling with these concerns I noticed that the steady stream of streaking car lights that had been overtaking me had been replaced by a single, constant spotlight that refused to pass. The road wasn&amp;rsquo;t illuminated by streetlights, so I was walking in the grass with the road about two feet to my left; I stepped a little more to my right and craned my neck over my left shoulder to see what was behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A car had stopped about ten feet behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I could see were the violently bright headlights that were cutting through the otherwise stygian surroundings. I thought that it might be one of Chris&amp;rsquo; parents; maybe they had come to check in on us and seen that I was gone. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have taken much pressing for Chris to confess. I took one step toward the car, and it broke its pause and started driving toward me at a slow pace. It passed me and I saw that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t Chris&amp;rsquo; parents&amp;rsquo; car, or any car that I recognized for that matter. I tried to see the driver, but it was too dark, and my pupils had shrunk when faced with the blinding lights from the car just moments before. They adjusted enough so that I could see a tremendous crack in the back window of the car as it drove away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of the whole affair; some people find it fun to scare other people&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;d often hide around corners and jump out at my mom, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I timed it right and got there about ten minutes before the movie. I had decided to wait outside until around 11:57, since that would give me time to find her inside if she was already seated. As I was considering the possibility that she might not show, I saw her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was alone, and she was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waved to her and walked to close the distance. She smiled and asked if my friends were already inside. I said that they weren&amp;rsquo;t and realized that this must seem like I was trying to make this a date. She didn&amp;rsquo;t seem bothered by that, nor was she bothered when I handed her the ticket I had already bought. She looked at me quizzically, and I said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;m rich.&amp;rdquo; She laughed and we went inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought us one popcorn and two drinks and spent most of the movie debating whether or not I should time reaching my hand into the popcorn bag when she reached in so they would touch. She seemed to enjoy the movie and before I knew it, it was over. We didn&amp;rsquo;t linger in the theatre, and because this was a midnight show we couldn&amp;rsquo;t loiter in the lobby, so we walked outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parking lot of the theatre was big because it connected with a mall that had gone out of business. Not wanting the night to be over just yet, I continued the conversation while casually walking toward the old mall. As we were about to round the corner and leave the theatre out of sight, I looked back and saw that her car wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one left in the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one had a large crack in the back window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My immediate uneasiness turned to understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That makes a lot of sense. The driver of that car works here and must have figured I was on my way to the movie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injecting real horror into the life of a horror fan seemed like an obvious move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked around the mall and talked about the movie. I told her that I thought &lt;em&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; was better than &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;, but she refused to agree. I told her of when I called her old number and about my dilemma about who would answer the phone. She didn&amp;rsquo;t find it as funny as I now did, but she took my phone and put her number in it. She commented that it might be the worst cell phone she&amp;rsquo;d ever seen. Her evaluation wasn&amp;rsquo;t rescinded when I told her I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even receive pictures on it. I called her so she&amp;rsquo;d have my number and she programmed it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told me that she was graduating, but she hadn&amp;rsquo;t done well in school so far that year so she wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if she&amp;rsquo;d even get into college. I told her to attach a picture of herself to the application and they&amp;rsquo;d pay her to go there just so they could look at her. She didn&amp;rsquo;t laugh at that one and I thought she might be offended&amp;mdash;she might have thought I was implying that she couldn&amp;rsquo;t get in based on her intelligence. I nervously glanced at her and she was just smiling and even in this poor light I could see that she was blushing. I wanted to hold her hand but I didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walked down the final side of the mall back toward the theatre, I asked her about Josh. She told me she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about it. I asked her if he was at least doing alright and she just said &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo; I figured Josh must have taken a wrong turn somewhere and started getting into trouble. I felt bad. I felt guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached the parking lot I noticed that the car with the cracked back window was gone and that her car was now the only one in the parking lot. She asked me if I needed a ride, and even though I really didn&amp;rsquo;t, I said that I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate it. I had drunk my whole soda during the movie and all the walking was putting pressure on my bladder. I knew that I could wait until I was back at Chris&amp;rsquo;, but I had decided that I was going to try to kiss her when she dropped me off, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want this biological nagging to rush me out of the car. This would be my first kiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could think of no ruse to conceal what I needed to do. The theatre had long closed so I only had one option. I told her that I was going to go behind the theatre to piss but that I&amp;rsquo;d be back in &amp;ldquo;two shakes&amp;rdquo;. It was obvious that I thought it was hilarious and she seemed to laugh more at how funny I found it than at how funny it clearly was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way toward the theatre I stopped and turned toward her. I asked her if Josh had ever told her that kid named Alex had done something nice for me. She paused to think for a moment and said that he had; she enquired as to why I had asked, but I said it was nothing. Josh really was a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to go behind the theatre I realized that there was a chain-link fence extending off and running parallel to the walls of the building. Where I stood she could still see me, and the fence seemed to stretch on endlessly, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just hop it, duck out of sight, and return as quickly as I could. It may have been too much of an effort, but I thought it polite. I climbed the fence and walked just a little ways until I was out of sight and urinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment the only sounds were the crickets in the grass behind me and the collision of liquid and cement. These sounds were overpowered by a noise that I can still hear when it is quiet and there are no other noises to distract my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the distance I heard a faint screeching which quickly subsided only to be replaced with a cascade of thundering vibrations. I realized quickly enough what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growling of the engine got louder. And then I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. Not louder. Closer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I realized this I started back toward the fence, but before I could get very far at all I hear a brief, truncated scream, and the roar of the engine terminated in a deafening thud. I started running, but after only two or three steps I was tripped by a loose piece of stone and fell hard and fast onto the concrete&amp;mdash;my head striking the corner of a chair as I fell. I was dazed for maybe thirty seconds, but the renewed rumbling of the engine drew my senses back and my equilibrium was restored by adrenaline. I redoubled my efforts. I was worried that whoever had crashed the car might harass Veronica. As I was climbing over the fence I saw that there was still only one car in the parking lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any evidence of a crash. I thought that I might have misjudged its direction or proximity. As I ran toward Veronica&amp;rsquo;s car and as my orientation changed, I saw what the car had hit. My legs stopped working almost completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Veronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her car was sitting between us and as I closed the distance and walked around it she came fully into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her body was twisted and crumpled like a discarded figure meant to represent a catalog of things the human body cannot do. I could see the bone of her right shin cutting through her jeans, and her left arm was wrapped so hard around the back of her neck that her hand fell on her right breast. Her head was craned back and her mouth hung widely open toward the sky. There was so much blood. As I looked at her I actually found it hard to discern whether she was laying on her back or her stomach, and this optical illusion made me feel sick. When you are confronted with something in the world that simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong, your mind tries to convince itself that it is dreaming, and to that end it provides you with that distinct sense of all things moving slowly as if through sap. In that moment I honestly felt that I would wake up any minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fumbled with my phone to call for help but I had no signal. I could see Veronica&amp;rsquo;s phone sticking out of what I thought was her front right pocket. I had no choice. Trembling, I reached for her phone and as I slid it out she moved and gasped for air so violently that it seemed as if she were trying to breathe in the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This startled me so much that I staggered back and fell onto the asphalt with her phone my hand. She was trying to adjust her body to get it into its natural position, but with every spasm and jerk I could hear the cracking and grinding of her bones. Without thinking, I scrambled over to her and put my face over hers and just said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Veronica, don&amp;rsquo;t move. Don&amp;rsquo;t move, OK? Just stay still. Don&amp;rsquo;t move. Veronica, please just don&amp;rsquo;t move.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept saying it but the words started to fall apart as tears came streaming down my face. I opened her phone. It still worked. It was still on the screen where she had saved my number and when I saw that, I felt my heart break a little. I called 911 and waited with her, telling her that she would be ok, and feeling guilty for lying to her every time I said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sound of sirens tore through the air she seemed to become more alert. She had remained conscious since I found her, but now more of the light was coming back into her eyes. Her brain was still protecting her from pain, though it looked as if it was finally allowing her to become aware that something was terribly wrong with her. Her eyes rolled over to mine and her lips moved. She was struggling, but I heard her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hhh&amp;hellip; he&amp;hellip; P&amp;hellip; pi&amp;hellip; picture. M&amp;hellip; my picture&amp;hellip; he took it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what she meant, so I said the only thing I could. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, Veronica.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rode with her in the ambulance where she finally lost consciousness. I waited in the room that they had reserved for her. I still had her phone so I put it with her purse and I called my mom from the hospital phone. It was about 4 AM. I told her that I was fine, but that Veronica was not. She cursed at me and said she&amp;rsquo;d be right there, but I told her I wasn&amp;rsquo;t leaving until Veronica was out of surgery. She said she&amp;rsquo;d come anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom and I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak that much. I told her I was sorry for lying, and she said that we&amp;rsquo;d talk about that later. I think that had we talked more in that room&amp;mdash;if I had just told her about Boxes or the night with the raft; if she had just told me more of what she knew&amp;mdash;I think that things would have changed. But we sat there in silence. She told me that she loved me and that I could call her whenever I wanted her to come get me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my mom was leaving, Veronica&amp;rsquo;s parents rushed in. Her dad and my mom exchanged a few words that appeared to be quite serious while Veronica&amp;rsquo;s mother talked to the person at the desk. Her mother was a nurse, but didn&amp;rsquo;t work at this hospital. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that she had tried to get Veronica transferred, but her condition was prohibitive. While we waited, the police came in and talked to each of us&amp;mdash;I told them what happened, they made some notes, and then they left. She came out of surgery and ninety percent of her body was covered in a thick, white cast. Her right arm was free, but the rest of her was bound like a cocoon. She was still under, but I remembered how I felt when I had my cast before Kindergarten. I asked a nurse for a marker, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything to write. I slept in a chair in the corner, and went home the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came back every afternoon for several days. At some point they had moved another patient into her room and set up a screen around Veronica&amp;rsquo;s bed to act as a partition. She didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be feeling better, but she made more moments of lucidity. But even during these periods we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really talk. Her jaw had been broken by the car, so the doctors had wired it shut. I sat with her for a while, but there was nothing much I could say. I got up and walked over to her. I kissed her on the forehead and she whispered through her clenched teeth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Josh&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This surprised me a little, but I looked at her and said, &amp;ldquo;Has he not come to see you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself really irritated. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even if Josh had been getting into trouble, he should still come see his sister,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to express this when she said, &amp;ldquo;No&amp;hellip; Josh&amp;hellip; he ran away&amp;hellip; I should&amp;rsquo;ve told you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt my blood turn to ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When? When did this happen?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When he was thirteen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did&amp;hellip; did he leave a note or something?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On his pillow&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She started crying and I followed her, but I think now we were crying for different reasons even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it. At this point there were a lot of things I still didn&amp;rsquo;t remember about my childhood, and there were a lot of connections I hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet made. I told her I had to go but that she could text me any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a text from her the next day telling me not to come back. I asked why and she said she didn&amp;rsquo;t want me to see her like that again. I agreed begrudgingly. We texted each other every day, though I kept this from my mom because I knew that she didn&amp;rsquo;t like me talking to Veronica. Usually her texts were fairly short, and mostly only in response to more lengthy texts that I would send her. I tried calling her only once, I was sure she was screening her calls, but hoped I could hear her voice; she picked up but didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything&amp;mdash;I could hear how labored her breathing was. About a week after she told me not to come see her anymore she sent me a text that simply read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I love you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was filled with so many different emotions, but I responded by expressing the most prevalent one. I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I love you, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that she wanted to be with me, and that she couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait until she could see me again. She told me that she had been released and was convalescing at her house. These exchanges carried on for several weeks, but every time I asked to come see her, she would say &amp;ldquo;soon&amp;rdquo;. I kept insisting and the following week she said that she thought she might be able to make it to the next midnight movie. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it, but she insisted that she would try. I got a text from her the afternoon of the movie saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See you tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got Ryan to drive me since Chris&amp;rsquo; parents had found out what had happened and said I wasn&amp;rsquo;t welcome at their house anymore. I explained to Ryan that she might be in bad shape, but that I really cared about her so to give us some space. He accepted that and we headed down there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veronica didn&amp;rsquo;t show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had saved a seat for her right next to me near the exit so she could get in and out easily, but ten minutes into the movie a man slid into the chair. I whispered, &amp;ldquo;Excuse me, this seat is taken,&amp;rdquo; but he didn&amp;rsquo;t respond at all; he just stared ahead at the screen. I remember wanting to move because there was something wrong with the way he was breathing. I forfeited because I realized that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I texted her the next day asking if she was alright and I enquired as to why she didn&amp;rsquo;t show the previous night. She responded with what would turn out to be the last message I&amp;rsquo;d receive from her. She simply said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See you again. Soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was delirious, and I was worried about her. I sent her several replies reminding her about the movie and saying it was no big deal but she just stopped replying. I grew increasingly upset over the next several days. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach her at her home because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that number, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure where they lived. My mood became increasingly depressed, and my mother, who had been really nice as of late, asked me if I was OK. I told her that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard from Veronica in days, and I felt all the warmth leave her disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She was supposed to meet me at the movies yesterday. I know it&amp;rsquo;s only been like three weeks since she got hit, but she said she would try to come, and after that she just stopped talking to me altogether. She must hate me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked confused, and I could read on her face that she was trying to tell if my mind had simply broken. When she saw that it hadn&amp;rsquo;t, her eyes began to water and she pulled me toward her, embracing me. She was beginning to sob, but it seemed too intense a reaction to my problem, and I had no reason to think that she particularly cared for Veronica. She drew in a shuttering breath and then said something that still makes nauseous, even now. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Veronica&amp;rsquo;s dead, sweetheart. Oh God, I thought you knew. She died on the last day you visited her. Oh baby, she died weeks ago.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had completely broken down, but I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of Veronica. I broke the embrace and staggered backwards. My mind was swimming. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible. &lt;em&gt;I had just exchanged messages with her yesterday.&lt;/em&gt; I could only think to ask one question, and it was probably the most trivial I could ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then why was her phone still on?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She continued sobbing. She didn&amp;rsquo;t answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exploded, &amp;ldquo;WHY DID IT TAKE THEM SO LONG TO SHUT OFF HER GODDAMNED PHONE?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her crying broke enough to mutter, &amp;ldquo;The pictures&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would come to find out that her parents thought that her phone had been lost in the accident, despite the fact that I had put it in her purse the night she was brought to the hospital. When they retrieved her belongings the phone was not among them. They intended to contact the phone company at the end of the billing cycle to deactivate the line, but they received a call informing them of a massive impending charge for hundreds of pictures that had been sent from her phone. Pictures. Pictures that were all sent to my phone. Pictures that I never got because my phone couldn&amp;rsquo;t receive them. They learned that they were all sent after the night she died. They deactivated the phone immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried not to think about the contents of those pictures. But I remember wondering for some reason whether I would have been in any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mouth went dry and I felt the painful sting of despair as I thought of the last message I received from her phone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See you again. Soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research on art and animation styles, and learned that this technique was known as &amp;ldquo;hyperrealism&amp;rdquo;, a style intended to give intense lifelike detail using traditional (non-digital) art methods. Some pieces of this genre were almost indistinguishable from photographs. The &amp;ldquo;Lion&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite that realistic—you could still tell easily enough that it was a cartoon, yet it was somehow as visually striking as a real photo of a lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued my research, now focusing on finding people who were knowledgeable about this art form. I narrowed my search down to a few academics and animators, and emailed them the Lion still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a response from one expert saying the style reminded him of Johann Strobl, an Austrian artist and animator who had moved to the United States in the 1930s. He had worked for Disney briefly before starting his own animation studio. He was known for his bizarre, deconstructionist approach to animation and had started his own small anti-art movement of sorts. Animators and cartoonists trained at his studio produced their own bizarre works, which often included violent and grotesque themes, despite the fact that the studio ostensibly marketed to children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email went on to explain that Strobl became increasingly obsessed with magic and the occult during his career. He became less and less functional until his studio was forced to close due to bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, the studio was known to produce only a handful of original works of its own. Apparently, the animators had spent a lot of time deconstructing and replicating the works of other companies, mainly Disney since they were the only major animation studio at the time, and altering them to make them surreal or disturbing. This would have opened the company up to piracy claims, except that they never sold such works to the public, instead gifting them to a handful of collectors within the anti-art elite community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strobl had also self-published a book, a manual of sorts which contained prints of some of his still cartoons and instructions on his technique. It was simply titled &amp;ldquo;Animation Deconstructed.&amp;rdquo; I immediately determined to read it, but it took me ages to find a copy. I managed to track one down at a public library headquarters three states away. The book was in their special archive collection, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it through Inter-Library Loan. I had to drive there, where they would allow me to examine it in their archive reading room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was sparse, dusty, and poorly lit. It had the feel of a 1950s police interrogation room. I was allowed to read the book of interest at the single table under the supervision of a librarian. It was yellowed, and the jacket was wrapped in protective plastic. The volume was short enough to read in an hour. Strobl was not as good at English as he was at drawing, so the self-published aspect really showed in the numerous grammar errors. There were a couple dozen prints in the book, all made in his unique hyper-realistic style. Again, they weren&amp;rsquo;t photorealistic like other artists in the genre, but had a depth of detail and perspective that made them appear alive all the same. None of them did anything paranormal or anything like that, but there was one that managed to seriously frighten me. It was a cartoon snake, a cobra, with its fangs bared and a menacing look in its eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how some paintings of people have the eyes painted in such a way as to give the impression of the subject&amp;rsquo;s gaze following you as you view it from different angles? Well, this piece didn&amp;rsquo;t do that, but it had some similar thing going on where the eyes of the snake appeared to bore right into you straight through the page. I felt like the snake was going to strike up and dig its fangs into my arm. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a trippy experience like with the Lion animation, but it was still surreal and unnerving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to sections on art technique, Strobl had also included a number of seemingly randomly placed critiques of the state of animation that could generously be described as educated rants. A frequent target of his criticisms was Walt Disney, whom he decried as an amateur buffoon who was holding back the animation medium from its true potential. The author went on to emphasize the need to be bold and daring in animation, and willing to push social taboos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned the volume to the librarian. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t discovered anything that would help me with my search for the &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; tape, but at least I had come away with some interesting insights into the philosophy of the man who may have been behind it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step was to visit Strobl&amp;rsquo;s studio, which involved yet another cross-country road trip. I started to wonder how much gas money I would have ended up spending by the end of my search for that damned video. Was it really cheaper than flying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the studio was still standing, though I had arrived anticipating that anything of major interest would have been looted decades ago. Still, I held out hope as I pulled into a shopping center parking lot. The rest of my journey would have to be on foot since the studio had predated modern roads. I crossed the interstate, there being only light traffic, and found and followed the old dirt road that would have been the sole source of vehicle traffic back then. By now it was largely overgrown, and I cursed myself for not bringing a machete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me two hours to reach the location. It was a one-story wooden building, with its windows boarded up, and foliage growing all around it. I walked the perimeter, looking for a way in that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open me up to charges of &amp;ldquo;breaking&amp;rdquo; and entering, though I seriously doubted anyone would ever know or care I had been here in any case. To my disappointment, no entryway had been left by previous urban explorers, and I had to hack away the boards of one window with a hatchet I had brought (it may have been easier to smash down the door, but that felt somewhat less ethical.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was of course no source of light, except the now-open window-way, but I had had the foresight to bring three high-powered LED lamps in my backpack, which I now set up around the floor, relieved that I did not see any scurrying or slithering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place seemed smaller on the inside, barely more spacious than my basement at home. There was no furniture except a couple broken easels on the floor. &lt;em&gt;They probably sold off the tables and desks to pay off their debts&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. Some scuff marks were visible on the wooden floor. There was a low wooden partition that sectioned off a small segment of the room. I guessed that this was where the administrative desk had been, while the rest of the floor was used for the actual animation work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really been expecting to find anything important, but it was still disappointing. I spent the next couple hours pacing the floor, wondering if the whole trip had been a waste of time and mileage. I was about to pack up my lamps and leave when I discovered a trap door behind the floor partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had taken one of the lamps off the floor to perch it on top of the partition, and the light now allowed me to see the outline of the trap door along with its hinges and latch. The door was about three feet by two feet. I grew excited and opened it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, the door did not appear to have a mechanism for staying open, and was too heavy for me to hold up. I had to back out through the window and back several times just to bring some rocks to prop it up. But the contents of the compartment were worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compartment was about three feet deep, and contained what looked like diagrams for animation or film devices, along with various little parts; knobs, bolts, lenses, and the like; all scattered at the bottom. I studied these with fascination, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t make heads or tails of the schematics. I tried fitting some of the parts together, with no success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided against taking these items with me. I had rationalized that violating the law by entering this place unlawfully was worth pulling back the curtain on whatever had caused my childhood trauma, but these items were unlikely to be of value to that end and thus stealing them for my own curiosity would go beyond the bounds of that justification. However, I did photograph each one of them just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody! It&amp;rsquo;s me, Jerry, from the gas station at the edge of town. Proud to be the newest member of the team. The owners were so impressed with how I managed to stay inside the store for several days without leaving or going insane that they offered me a full time position while the regular clerk is out recovering from his leg injury. Happy Monday, ya&amp;rsquo;ll!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other guy asked me to do him a small favor while he&amp;rsquo;s getting some much needed &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo; and relaxation. He gave me the password to his laptop and detailed instructions to transcribe his journal entries from last week. In exchange, he agreed to keep me on as a full-time assistant after he gets back. I get to to learn what to expect on the job through first-hand documentation, and he gets to continue his weird little blog thing. Now that&amp;rsquo;s what I call win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m being honest, this is probably the best thing that could have happened to me right now. Ever since the program mysteriously dissolved at the Mathmatist community, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling very lost and vulnerable. I&amp;rsquo;ve been losing weight and having trouble sleeping, and when I do, I keep having these weird dreams of some enormous being, deep below the gas station, waiting to devour us all. Clearly, a mistake was made and I was overlooked. If any of my old brothers and sisters are out there and see this post, please, please, contact me! Tell the seniors they forgot me! I&amp;rsquo;m not mad! I miss you! I love you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get started, some guys in suits came by and suggested that if this blog were going to continue, that I make a PSA. If there is anybody still alive that read the story about what happened here on Halloween, don&amp;rsquo;t wait for symptoms to start. Please go to the nearest emergency room or call the Center for Disease Control and tell them you are experiencing the effects of &amp;ldquo;Romald&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the journals. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do my best because the guy&amp;rsquo;s handwriting is awful. But here&amp;rsquo;s the parts I could read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/07/07&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man in the trench coat was standing out back when I went to take out the garbage tonight. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why the man in the trench coat keeps visiting my store, or why I&amp;rsquo;ve never gotten a good look at him. He was standing at the tree line just beyond the dumpsters, staring as he ever did. Tonight, I stared back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hinge of his jaw began halfway up his face, where his nose should have been, the edges pulled back to either ear in a skeletal grin. His tiny, milky-white eyes were beads behind the oily black hairline that hung down straight in bangs all the way to his cheek jowl. His impossibly-wide mouth bisected the head between greasy hair and wet flesh. Drool, I would assume&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stood there, fifteen feet apart, staring at one another for what might have been ten seconds or ten minutes until finally the man in the trench coat turned away. His legs bent funny, in a way that human legs shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to bend, and he landed on all fours before galloping off into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the last of the man in the trench coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit! Did you guys read that?! This is some crazy shit! Sorry, Jerry again. I promise I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do the running commentary thing, I just had to say&amp;hellip; Jesus, you know? This is some weird stuff. I mean, I remember him telling me a couple weeks ago to go outside and talk to a man in a trenchcoat. Super glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t now. What the hell? Ok, that&amp;rsquo;s it, I&amp;rsquo;m done. Back to the transcriptions. The next page is soaked in blood and completely unreadable, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to skip that part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hundreds and hundreds of them. She had never seen so many in one place before, not even in her dreams. Before she left, she told me that I would see her again. Was that supposed to be a warning or a flirtation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:23 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a quieter night than I&amp;rsquo;m used to. The package from yesterday afternoon still sits on the counter where I left it. The label is made out to me, with a return address I don&amp;rsquo;t recognize. The rectangular parcel is wrapped like a Christmas present with red and yellow stripes and feels heavy. I would say it&amp;rsquo;s just the right size for a dead cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any realistic reason I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t open the package, but there is something in the back of my mind telling me that to open this would be tantamount to opening Pandora&amp;rsquo;s Box. That the contents of this little parcel will irrevocably change the course of my life in a way that may have seemed impossible before. I feel like this box is full of butterflies ready to create tsunamis, and I&amp;rsquo;m just not sure I&amp;rsquo;m ready for that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach Marlboro how to clean the drink machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:47 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro is passed out in a hammock in the supply closet. I think he finished that bottle on his own. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll go clean the drink machines by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:45 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hand plants are growing faster than I had anticipated. They are now past the elbows, almost to the shoulders. I saw that the crop had caught a curious coyote that got too close. It was not pretty. I also noticed that Rocco is still alive. I caught him sitting on the roof, tossing food to the crop of hand plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why they&amp;rsquo;re growing so fast. They&amp;rsquo;re eating way too much. If this gets out of control, I may have to torch this crop just like the others. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to. It sends shivers down my spine whenever I hear the way they scream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego came in for his morning shift looking pretty terrible. He filled up on coffee and told me that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been sleeping too well. The bad dreams had been keeping him from getting a restful night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I should tell Diego about my condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked about the gift-wrapped package sitting on the counter. I told him that it came with the post yesterday, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know who it was from. He asked if I was going to open it, and I told him that I had a bad feeling and pretty much decided to never ever open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to open the package. Without any fanfare or drumroll, I&amp;rsquo;ll just tell you that what I found inside was a brand new laptop computer. I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned my own laptop before, and the only computer that ever belonged to me was a crappy little Tandy-1000 that I put together as a kid. I&amp;rsquo;ve always used the library computer lab or the browser on my phone to access the internet. This could be a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box also contains a signal repeater and some other gizmos. I know this is crazy, but I think I may actually be able to access the internet from the gas station now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a handwritten note at the bottom of the package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left a comment on your page. There&amp;rsquo;s something I want to tell you. I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying reading these stories you&amp;rsquo;re writing but I think if you actually sit down and write out one story at a time that you will get a lot more upvotes. It&amp;rsquo;s very good, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying it&amp;rsquo;s bad. But it right now seems like a lot of half stories thrown together. I think you&amp;rsquo;d do great if you actually write out a whole story at a time. I bet you really could get a lot of upvotes and attention. It gets kind of confusing right now. Maybe start with when you got there and work your way up to now I bet that would be super awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m so fascinated but a little muddled as well. I can tell you have a great talent for writing but I just thought maybe I&amp;rsquo;d offer a suggestion to help. Please do not take offense&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s just something I was thinking. Hope all is going well for you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. Another one of my readers tracked me down. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to figure out how people keep finding me and put a stop to this. Thank you, whoever you are, for the laptop. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely keeping it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:15 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned on the wifi card and noticed that for some reason there are dozens of secured networks around the gas station, most of which have four or five bars. The names for their networks are pure gobbledy-gook like this one: &amp;ldquo;1E7G7C7TA11GUY232331324.&amp;rdquo; Who the hell is transmitting wifi out here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man came into the store to buy a gas can a couple hours ago. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it at the time, but then he came back in asking if we could help him out with something down the road. I never got his name, but he was a big guy, tan skin and a thick beard. He said he was having &amp;ldquo;car problems.&amp;rdquo; I told him I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a car guy, but he insisted that he didn&amp;rsquo;t need a car guy, he just needed someone else to see what he was seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro agreed to watch the counter while Diego and I followed the bearded man down the hill and around the curve, close to the spot where Diego saw that thing in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember what happened that night. After we got everything sorted out with Spencer and things started to go back to &amp;ldquo;normal,&amp;rdquo; I asked Diego what it was that he saw in the woods that sent him running in such a careless panic, but he just shook his head and said he didn&amp;rsquo;t know. The mind is a funny thing, and memories aren&amp;rsquo;t the most reliable. I realize that I&amp;rsquo;m not the only person from the gas station with a list of &amp;ldquo;try and forget&amp;rdquo; stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man&amp;rsquo;s car was parked on the side of the road, close to the same spot that Kieffer&amp;rsquo;s SUV was broken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So my car started acting funny,&amp;rdquo; the guy said as we neared his vehicle. I began to wonder why we had walked this whole way, when our own vehicle would be quite useful in case of a dead battery or random bear attack. The guy kept going, &amp;ldquo;I pulled over onto the side of the road when my electricals all started going haywire. I killed the engine, then when I tried to turn it over again, nadda.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see at this point that the hood was open. The man was driving a big black SUV similar to the one Kieffer owned, but newer and shinier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t see what&amp;rsquo;s so weird about that. You need us to call a tow or-&amp;rdquo; the man cut Diego off (rudely, I might add).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I popped the hood, but everything was in order. I thought it maybe just needed some gas, so I went up to the station. Then when I got back, I saw this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rounded the front of the car and saw the &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; he was being so vague about: A small oak tree, maybe four or five years old, was growing up from the ground beneath the car, through the engine, and stretched upwards at least nine feet. The trunk of the tree had swallowed a decent portion of the engine, and from the looks of it the car had been parked there for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Interesting,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;And you&amp;rsquo;re sure that wasn&amp;rsquo;t there when you started driving?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he could answer, he spun his head around and looked at the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You boys hear that?&amp;rdquo; He asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stood still and listened, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; I answered. Diego shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You boys know what an anglerfish is?&amp;rdquo; the bearded man asked as he walked to the back door and opened it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I guess,&amp;rdquo; I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bearded man pulled up a secret compartment from beneath the floorboard and retrieved a large automatic rifle. I&amp;rsquo;m not a gun guy, and I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you what kind of gun it was, but it was big and impressive and cool looking. The guy checked the clip and clicked something on the gun that could have been the safety. Again, I&amp;rsquo;m not a gun guy. But it sounded super cool. Diego put a hand on my shoulder and slowly backed away from the man with the gun, pulling me with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the man didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to mind us one bit, He was focused on whatever he heard in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I&amp;rsquo;m right, you boys have an anglerfish in them woods. It&amp;rsquo;s putting something out there to lure me in. Make me think I&amp;rsquo;m hearing something that I&amp;rsquo;m not. Then when I go looking for the one thing BAM it attacks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, like a siren?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man looked at me over his shoulder with a smirk and said, &amp;ldquo;Yeah. Like a siren. Ya&amp;rsquo;ll may wanna get out of here. This could get dangerous. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about me. I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with these things before, I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man pointed his gun and marched into the woods while Diego and I made our way back to the gas station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time for me to go home. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used the laptop yet, but maybe tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll start to type up these journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s getting dark so early these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the bearded man&amp;rsquo;s SUV is still at the bottom of the hill with a tree growing through it. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call that a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I burned the rest of the hand plants. I finally know what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, I noticed what looked like strange mushrooms growing in a patch near the dumpster behind the gas station. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much about them, except that it was strange that Rocco&amp;rsquo;s brood wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go near them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took a closer look, I could have sworn that they looked just like baby fingers poking out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the weather got warmer, I kept an eye on the crops. They started getting longer and looking more and more distinguishably similar to human fingers. I swear they even started growing fingernails. Sometimes, I would see them bend at the digits to squash a bug that wandered too close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the mushrooms started sprouting leaves, and the finger sections continued to stretch out, creating what could only be described as hands. Human hands. They would ball up into fists during the daytime and open up in the moonlight. I dug one of them up one day when we were really slow at work, and I called Farmer Junior to ask for his professional opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the untrained eye, the hand plant looked just like a regular human hand. Smaller than an adult&amp;rsquo;s, but larger than a child&amp;rsquo;s. Adolescent. Teenager maybe. At the wrist it turned into a gnarled root that smelled like sassafras, and throughout the plant tiny leaves were sprouting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmer Junior stood in the gas station looking it over for a while before asking me if we had any more of those things. I lied and told him no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the owners what they wanted me to do. They thought it over for a couple days and then told me to keep them. I think they expected to be able to make some money off of them somehow, but eventually everyone forgot they were there. Everyone but me. And Farmer Junior, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about the bearded man when I first heard the sound of a baby crying somewhere outside. I was alone in the store and my first instinct was not the heroic one that most people may have had: to run outside and see where the poor baby was. My first instinct was more callous and rational and in the form of a question: how the hell did a baby get way out here without me hearing it coming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. The sound of the cries, which I could deduce were coming from the tree line, were getting louder and louder and more and more desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around for Marlboro, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find him anywhere. If I was going to investigate the potential forest baby, I was going to have to do it alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered the bearded man hearing the siren call of the thing he called an Anglerfish. I remembered Diego&amp;rsquo;s sound of crunching and the &amp;ldquo;Strega.&amp;rdquo; And absolutely no part of me believed that I would be safe if I went into the woods or that there was really a baby crying out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed a flashlight and went out back. The crying seemed to be moving deeper into the forest, quickly, like the crying baby were being carried off by something that didn&amp;rsquo;t have to stop and move around trees or physical barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked into the forest just far enough to find the last thing I ever expected to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the hand plants had extended slightly further than the little patch outside the gas station. Those plants that I had been watching and burning whenever they got too aggressive were not as controlled as I had previously believed. Because out here, just a few steps into the woods, was a hand plant that I had missed, that I had never trimmed or culled or burned, that was left free to grow as large and wild as it possibly could. Out here was a handplant that had grown so large it had fallen over. It had grown past the shoulder. It had grown its own head, and torso, and crotch and legs. Out here was a full human body covered in tiny leaves, huddled on the ground and attached to the soil by thick talons of brown roots. And the weirdest part of all? The body was one that I recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body, the fully-grown hand plant, was Kieffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what possessed me to touch him. Maybe I just wanted to make sure that he was real, as if touching him would prove that one way or the other. When I did, his eyes opened and he cracked a smile. He could not move, the roots had him firmly stuck in place, but this kieffer plant could talk. And talk he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed out there talking for over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into everything the kieffer plant said, but I will say this. There is something under the gas station. Something big and powerful. Something plotting. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for years in a cloud of this dark god&amp;rsquo;s farts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt extra terrible setting the fully developed kieffer plant on fire after I burned the rest of the crop of handplants, but honestly what choice did I have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back to the gas station, Spencer was waiting for me. He knew I knew. And I knew he knew I knew. I was halfway expecting what came next, but not expecting him to enjoy himself quite so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer locked the front doors, then proceeded to beat the crap out of me. I&amp;rsquo;d like to say I got a few good hits in as well, but that would be a huge lie. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I laid a single finger on him. Although, I did mess his knuckles up pretty good with my face, so I have that going for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer dragged me across the gas station to the hallway past the bathrooms, past the walk-in cooler, to that big strange door that I had only just noticed a couple weeks ago. If it were possible for me to pass out, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I would be unconscious right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why are you doing this?&amp;rdquo; I asked as he banged on the door three times. There was a sound from the other side and then Spencer yelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open up! It&amp;rsquo;s me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door cracked open and Spencer dragged me into a room I had never seen before. It looked like an old office. There was a desk next to a wall of monitors with security feeds from all over the store and the perimeter. Security feeds from cameras I never knew existed. In the middle of the room was a large hole that looked like it had been created with a team of jackhammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time for you to meet my boss,&amp;rdquo; Spencer said as he dragged me to the edge of the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kieffer.&amp;rdquo; I said, to which Spencer let out a hearty laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, not Kieffer. My boss put Kieffer out there and hired me to watch him. My boss is much bigger than some idiot politician.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I half expected Spencer to go into the cliche movie-villain exposition rant, but instead he Sparta&amp;rsquo;d me right into this hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my leg is broken. At least, I assume that&amp;rsquo;s what the bone poking out means, but hey, I&amp;rsquo;m no doctor. I would be really worried right now if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the fact that I stole Spencer&amp;rsquo;s cell phone in the scuffle. Just as I expected, Spencer has the same network as Kieffer, which means he somehow has service. I put in a call to Tom&amp;rsquo;s direct number, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure he&amp;rsquo;ll be along shortly. Until he gets here, I&amp;rsquo;m just passing the time updating my journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody just dropped the laptop into this hole with me. Maybe it was Spencer? Maybe he thinks I&amp;rsquo;m dead? Maybe I am. Again, I&amp;rsquo;m not a doctor. Whoever it was, I think I might have heard the sound of boot spurs clicking against tile as he walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll boot this thing up and start transcribing my journal before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so this is the last of his journals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering to yourself, where was Jerry while Spencer was beating the crap out of poor old Jack? Well, I had gone into town to see a movie. Yes, I went and watched Thor: Ragnorock. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it, go see it! It was awesome! I guess I&amp;rsquo;m lucky I went when I did, otherwise this Spencer guy might have tossed me into that hole as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the one that found Jack. When I came back to the gas station, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anyone anywhere, so I went searching until I noticed that door at the edge of the hall cracked open slightly. I also found a really poorly made bomb behind the register, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to disassemble. You can thank the mandatory bomb-building classes at the Mathmatist program for that. No big deal, just me being my typical heroic self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Diego to help me haul Jack up out of the hole and then Diego moved him to an &amp;ldquo;undisclosed location&amp;rdquo; for a few days while his leg mends. When he gets back, I&amp;rsquo;ll let him have his laptop to continue his little blog thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, it&amp;rsquo;s just me, Diego, and the racoons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Jack usually end these things? Oh yeah, &amp;ldquo;To be continued&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: I just caught myself digging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been way too long since I posted an update, and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry about that. There&amp;rsquo;s also been some confusion about the new formatting requirements on the board, which I&amp;rsquo;ve cleared up. So these next few stories are going to be posted a little differently! They&amp;rsquo;ll be in chronological order, and I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to tie them into each other as much as I can so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t skip around too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started out as a rookie, no one had told me a lot about the job in terms of weird things that could happen. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming this was largely to prevent me from freaking out and abandoning the park. But a few months into my service, when I was still a rookie, a friend and I were drunk at a party, and he opened up a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, it can get a little crazy out there, I guess. I think the worst ones are when people die when they just shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, you know? Or when we find &amp;rsquo;em dead like ten minutes after someone says they saw them last. &amp;lsquo;They were fine when I passed them on the switchback, I swear!&amp;rsquo; That sort of shit. Like, take this guy who I found one spring out on a really popular trail. Someone comes into the VC freaking about about some guy who&amp;rsquo;s lying in the middle of the path in this giant pool of blood. So we run out there, and we find this guy dead as a doornail. Which he absolutely should be, because the back of his head is like mashed potatoes. The skull is decimated, brains are leaking out like custard filling, and they guy&amp;rsquo;s old so you figure, yeah, he probably fell and hit his head.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Old people fall all the time, it&amp;rsquo;s no big deal. Except that this area where he fell doesn&amp;rsquo;t HAVE any big rocks. There’s not even any stumps or big branches. And on top of that, there&amp;rsquo;s no blood trail, so he clearly died where he dropped. Now that&amp;rsquo;s when you’d turn to murder, but there were people just out of line of sight with the guy. If someone came up behind him and murdered him, there&amp;rsquo;s no way someone wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have heard. And again, even if someone had, there&amp;rsquo;d be a blood trail, and spatter all over the place. But everyone on the scene said it looked exactly like he&amp;rsquo;d fallen and smashed his head on a rock. So what the fuck did he hit his head on?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And then there was this lady I found in a different park about five years ago, back when I was upstate. We found her in the middle of a stand of big junipers, curled around the trunk, like she was huggin&amp;rsquo; it. We pick her up to move her, and a fucking waterfall comes out of her mouth, splashes all over my shoes. Her clothes are dry, and her hair is dry, but the amount of water in her lungs and stomach was phenomenal. Unreal, man. Coroner&amp;rsquo;s report? Says the cause of death was drowning. Her lungs were completely full of water. This, even though we&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of the high desert, and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a body of water for miles. No puddles, no nothing. No signs of anyone else being out there. I mean yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s possible they were murdered. But why go out of the way to do it like that? Why not just stab &amp;rsquo;em and be done with it? I dunno, it just sits weird with me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course, that freaked me out a little. But we were wasted, and I guess I sort of wrote it off as a fluke. I also assumed there was exaggeration there, since, you know, we were wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t like talking about this next case very much. It was an awful one that I&amp;rsquo;ve done my best to forget about, but of course, that’s easier said than done. This happened about six months after the conversation with my friend at the bar, and up until that point, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of really weird shit go down. A few things here and there, and of course the stairs, but it&amp;rsquo;s amazingly easy to get used to stuff like that when it&amp;rsquo;s treated as if it&amp;rsquo;s normal. This case was a little different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy with Down&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome in his 20s went missing after his family lost sight of him on a major path. That was odd in and of itself, because this guy never left his mom&amp;rsquo;s side. She was absolutely convinced he&amp;rsquo;d been kidnapped, and unfortunately, a Ranger who isn&amp;rsquo;t with the park anymore insinuated that no one was going to kidnap someone&amp;hellip; well, with that kind of disability. Not very tactful, to say the least. We wasted a lot of time trying to calm her down enough to get information about him, and then we put out an official missing persons call. Because of the urgency of the situation, him being mostly unable to function alone, we had local police come in and help us. We didn&amp;rsquo;t find him the first night, which was heartbreaking. None of us wanted to think of him being alone out there. We assumed he&amp;rsquo;d just kept wandering, and was staying ahead of us. We brought out Helis the next day, and they spotted him in a little canyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helped bring him back up, but he was in bad shape, and I think we all knew he wasn&amp;rsquo;t gonna make it. He&amp;rsquo;d fallen and broken his spine, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel his lower half. He&amp;rsquo;d also broken both his legs, one at the femur, and he&amp;rsquo;d lost a lot of blood. He was confused and scared while he was alone, so he&amp;rsquo;d probably exacerbated the injuries by dragging himself a little ways. I know it sounds awful, but while I was riding in the copter with him, I asked him why he’d wandered off. I just wanted something to tell his mother, to let her know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t her fault, because he was fading fast and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think she’d get to ask him herself. He was crying, and he said something about how &amp;rsquo;the little sad boy&amp;rsquo; had wanted him to come play. He said the little boy wanted to &amp;rsquo;trade&amp;rsquo; so he could &amp;lsquo;go home&amp;rsquo;. Then he closed his eyes, and when he woke up again, he was in the canyon. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that’s exactly what he said, but it was what I thought the gist of it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He kept crying, asking where his mommy was, and I held his hand and tried my best to keep him calm. &amp;lsquo;It was cold out there.&amp;rsquo; He kept saying that. &amp;lsquo;It was cold out there. My legs were frozen. It was cold out there. It&amp;rsquo;s cold in me.&amp;rsquo; He was getting even weaker, so he eventually stopped talking, and he closed his eyes for a while. Then, when we were about five minutes from the hospital, he looked right at me, with these big tears running down his face, and he said &amp;lsquo;Mama won&amp;rsquo;t see me no more. Love mama, wish she was here.&amp;rsquo; And he closed his eyes and he just&amp;hellip; never woke up. It was horrible, and I don&amp;rsquo;t like talking about it. That case was one of the first ones that really rattled me badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of how badly it affected me, I reached out to a senior Ranger, and who ended up helping me through it. As time went on, and we got to know each other better, he ended up sharing one of his own stories with me. It was disturbing, but it helped to know that I wasn’t the only one affected by the things going on out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think this must have happened before you got here, because I think if it had happened while you were here, you&amp;rsquo;d have remembered it. I know it didn&amp;rsquo;t end up in the news, for some reason, but I think most people who’ve been here long enough know about it. The park sold off a portion of land to a logging company, and it was a really controversial thing. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that large or old of a plot, and it was right after the recession, so we needed cash bad. Anyway, they were felling this plot of land, and we get a call that we need to get our supervisors out right away. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but they ended up sending me and a few other guys along with the heads, I guess for power in numbers, to see what was up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We got there, and all these guys are crowded around a tree that they’ve just cut down. They&amp;rsquo;re all pissed off and freaking out, and the foreman comes over and says he wants to know what we think we&amp;rsquo;re up to. &amp;lsquo;What the hell y&amp;rsquo;all think this is, some kinda sick joke? You&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of fuckin&amp;rsquo; nerve pulling this shit; we bought this land fair and square!&amp;rsquo; Well we don&amp;rsquo;t know what the hell he&amp;rsquo;s talking about, so he brings us over to this felled tree and points at it and tells us that when they cut it down, it was just like this, and they&amp;rsquo;ll be damned if they put it there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The inside of the tree was all rotted out and hollow in one spot, and when they&amp;rsquo;d cut it down, it had exposed that chamber, and inside it is a hand. Like a perfectly severed hand. And looks like it’s actually fused with the inside of the tree. Well now we think THEY’RE pulling a joke, so we tell them that we don&amp;rsquo;t like being fucked with, and we start to leave, but they tell us they&amp;rsquo;ve already called the cops, and that they&amp;rsquo;ll go right to the media if we don&amp;rsquo;t stick around. Well that gets the heads&amp;rsquo; attention, so they stick around and talk to the police about it. Everyone is denying that they put the hand in there, and besides, how would anyone have even done it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s clearly a real hand, but it&amp;rsquo;s not mummified or skeletal. It&amp;rsquo;s brand new, probably not even a day old. And it is definitely fused with the wood; you can see that it&amp;rsquo;s coming right out of it. The loggers, they insist that they didn&amp;rsquo;t put it there. Somehow, this fresh human hand ended up fused to the inside of this living tree. The cops have them cut up that section of tree into a movable chunk. Then they take the hand away, and the area is closed off. There was a pretty big investigation, but I know they didn’t find any answers. Now it&amp;rsquo;s become this legend, and as far as I know, we haven&amp;rsquo;t sold any more property for logging.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you all know, I went to a training seminar recently, and heard some amazing and horrible things there. One of the guys I talked to while I was there told me a story when we were all around the campfire one night. We were both pretty drunk (you&amp;rsquo;ll see a pattern here), and we were swapping stories. He told me this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Me and another guy were out on a field search because some campers reported screaming noises at night. So we head out there to look for whatever fucking mountain lion has wandered into the area, and I&amp;rsquo;m pissed. We&amp;rsquo;ve had three of them show up in the camping areas that year alone and I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired as hell of constantly having to deal with them. Plus, I just don&amp;rsquo;t like them anyway. They&amp;rsquo;re a pain in the ass and they&amp;rsquo;re loud and they scare the shit out of me. Fuckin&amp;rsquo; cats. Pieces of shit. I&amp;rsquo;m groanin&amp;rsquo; about it to the guy I&amp;rsquo;m with and he thinks it&amp;rsquo;s a real fuckin&amp;rsquo; riot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So we&amp;rsquo;re seeing all these broken branches and what look like dens and we&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure we know where this thing is. I call in and they tell me to confirm if possible, which you know just means they want to you to step in a big pile of shit and use that as proof. I&amp;rsquo;m not seeing any, though, so I basically just tell &amp;rsquo;em to shove it, I&amp;rsquo;m done. We know that damn thing&amp;rsquo;s out here somewhere, even if I&amp;rsquo;m not stepping in its shit or inside its mouth or whatever. Guy I&amp;rsquo;m with wanders off to take a piss or whatever, and I stay behind watching this little burrow under a tree to see if maybe a fox or somethin&amp;rsquo; is living under it, &amp;lsquo;cause I love foxes, man. They&amp;rsquo;re cute as hell. But anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m watching this tree and I start hearing branches crackling and it&amp;rsquo;s coming from the direction my partner went opposite of. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve got my pistol, but you and I both know that’s not gonna do shit against a cat. I cock it and holler for my partner to get his dumb ass back, but he&amp;rsquo;s too far and he can&amp;rsquo;t hear me. I stand up and get my sights on where the thing is approaching, and I shit you not, man, I just about peed myself. This guy is coming toward me, and he&amp;rsquo;s backflipping through the fucking woods.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like, instead of walking, he&amp;rsquo;s doing these crazy fucking backflips, and I swear to God he cleared every fucking log and bush in his path. It was like he knew right where he was going. I yell at the guy to stop right where he is, that I&amp;rsquo;m pointing a gun right at him, but he keeps coming, and I just kinda lost it. I shot at the ground in front of him, and it was a dumb fuckin’ thing to do, but man, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want this guy anywhere near me. When I fired, he was about fifty yards from me, and as soon as the gun goes off, he whirls around and goes off, back-flipping back into the woods. My partner hears my gun go off and runs back and asks what&amp;rsquo;s up, and I tell him there&amp;rsquo;s some fucking weirdo out here hopped up on God knows what, and we need to get the hell out of Dodge. I let the cops know what happened, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get in any trouble for firing, but man, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what that motherfucker was on. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like that before. Shit was absolutely butt-fuck crazy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we can agree that there&amp;rsquo;s stuff going on out here in the woods, and while I&amp;rsquo;m not going to spout off about what it could be, or offer any theories, what I want people to take away from all of this is that it is so damn important to be safe when you&amp;rsquo;re out there. I know a lot of you think you&amp;rsquo;re invincible, but the fact is that you CAN die out there, or be hurt, or go missing. It&amp;rsquo;s easier than you&amp;rsquo;d ever imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for this relatively short update, guys; I will do my absolute best to continue this series as soon as possible. Thanks for all your continuing support, it means the world to me!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Chapter 6: Extus</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brief instant before the transition between Entropy and Extus, I was
hoping that I would get Godzilla and Angurius back. As the board appeared, I saw
that my wish was half granted: I had Godzilla back, but no Anguirus. I would have
preferred both, but despite Anguirus&amp;rsquo;s neat abilities I would have chosen Godzilla
if I had to pick between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/extusboard1-1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/extusboard1-1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Extus board&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extus had two different colored temples, white and pink. A pyramid, what looked
like some modern buildings, and two other icons I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out at the
time. The new bosses were Kumonga, Gorosaurus, and Not-Ghidorah, (whom I was
dreading to see, let alone fight.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Godzilla back, I was excited again and eager to explore, yet still
cautious. I went to the Quiz level first, just as before. This time, Face&amp;rsquo;s
questions were more random than ever:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do elephants breathe?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been molested by a family member?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Weird Face #6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever raped someone?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Weird Face #8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is green your favourite color?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Weird Face #10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the computer the pinnacle of modern technology?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a tough guy?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you fly?
Answer: No, Reaction: Weird Face #9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you stand on your head?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Weird Face #7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you hate raccoons?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Confused&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel blame?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: No, Reaction: Weird Face #11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like a new monster?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Surprised&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you miss me?&lt;br&gt;
Answer: Yes, Reaction: Sad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy that I was getting a new monster, but that last question bothered
me. &amp;ldquo;Will you miss me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/willyoumissme.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/willyoumissme.png&#34;  alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;Will you miss me?&amp;rdquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is Face referring to when I finish the game?&amp;rdquo; I thought. Since the revelation
of the game&amp;rsquo;s truly otherworldly nature, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to think of Face, or
anything else in the game. But something about that last statement gave me a
genuine feeling of sadness from Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was thinking about this, the game had gone back to the board. I had a new
monster, but I had no idea who it was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/solomonappears-2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/solomonappears-2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Solomon&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sprite had a slight resemblance to Rodan, but the head was totally off. I
moved this mysterious newcomer to a White Temple icon and started the level.
When I started the level, this screen appeared with the text &amp;ldquo;FIND THE GEM&amp;rdquo;.
Presumably instructions for beating the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/findthegem.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/findthegem.png&#34;  alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;FIND THE GEM&amp;rdquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that I got my first look at my new playable monster: A hairy, dark blue
creature with bat wings and a skull-like face named &amp;ldquo;Solomon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/whitetemple1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/whitetemple1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Solomon&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I also found that my path was blocked by a beam of light, and a small pillar
with a plate on it. I figured that this beam of light was blocking the exit, so
I have to find the gem and drop it on the plate to deactivate the beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly I was going to do that, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything in the
original game requiring you to find an item to beat a level. I&amp;rsquo;d have to find
out when I obtained the gem. The only direction I had to go was left, so on I
proceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon was an interesting monster, to say the least. He was capable of both
flight and a heat beam, both of which proved to be very useful. He also could
kick and slash with his wings, but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White Temple&amp;rsquo;s music was a vocalizing choir, or a videogame approximation of
such. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to describe but it had a very &amp;ldquo;holy&amp;rdquo; sound to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/whitetemple2enemies.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I started running into waves of strange new enemies. They
did little to stop me, I ran past them while slashing and didn&amp;rsquo;t take any
damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a &amp;ldquo;pause&amp;rdquo; between each wave of enemies, after you had killed about
ten, there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any for about a minute, then the next wave would appear.
After five minutes, I noticed holes in the floor and ceiling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/whitetemple3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guillotine mouthed creatures were rapidly flying up and down these crevices, so
I had to time my jumps carefully, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;d get another shot
at this. Luckily I managed to get through without a scratch. I&amp;rsquo;m just lucky, I
guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/whitetempleboss.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that I found myself at the end of the hallway, facing some kind of
mini-boss monster. It moved fast and had some kind of projectile that it shot in
four directions, but I killed it quite easily using Solomon&amp;rsquo;s heat beam. When
the battle was over I had my gem, which was inside the creature&amp;rsquo;s head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that I could pick up and hold the gem by walking over to it and holding
down B. I made the long trek back to the start, deposited the gem on the plate,
which deactivated the beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time you complete a stage or defeat a boss with Solomon, this screen
appears. I have no idea what &amp;ldquo;STILL THE BEST 1973&amp;rdquo; means. Neither the date nor
the phrase has any meaning or significance to me that I can think of, and I&amp;rsquo;ve
spent a lot of time thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next level I played was one that I call &amp;ldquo;Bronze Pyramids&amp;rdquo;. I used Godzilla,
and found he had been leveled up to twelve since I last played as him in
Dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/bronzepyramids1-1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bronze Pyramids were fairly normal as far as these levels go, but the
visuals were quite interesting, almost unusually colorful and lively. The music
had a fittingly Egyptian style to it, it was slow and mysterious sounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strolled through the level fighting off the various enemies, none were too
difficult (although the ants could be a pain if you ran into too many at once).
My favorite enemy was this giant reptile I encountered halfway through;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the level I came to a giant pyramid and I engaged in yet another
mini-boss fight. Although this was one was a bit different, because I had to
fight two of these monsters at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individually, I could have dealt with them easily, but fighting both of them at
once was challenging. But I sped things up by tricking one of the twin beasts
into barbecuing his brother by jumping when he uses his flame breath:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After defeating the twin monsters, I noticed something strange after returning
to the board: I was now able to move my monster piece anywhere on the board,
without limits. Normally Godzilla could only move three spaces each turn, and
Mothra could move five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try out Solomon some more, so I moved his piece over to one of the
brown pillar looking icons with colored dots and started the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I got to the level, I then realized what the level icon represented: Totem
Poles. I was greeted by two of them right at the beginning. The music had a
Native American sound to it. It seemed to be using the same instruments as the
Entropy Forest, it was noticeably different but just as foreboding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/totem2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walked around for three minutes with nothing else in sight besides the totem
poles. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it until then, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting another level with
nothing &amp;ldquo;alive&amp;rdquo; in it, after all the activity in Entropy. Walking by all those
multicolored faces, this unnerving level left me feeling like I was being
watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only about ten minutes after I started Extus, I was already halfway through.
After getting back from the the Totem Pole level, I tried out one of the TV
Screens to see how strange they were this time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Even more strange than before, apparently. The music for this was the Uranus
theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched back to Godzilla to play another level, and this level was quite a
surprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a normal City level! The colors were gloomy, but even still this was
quite a shock. This was the kind of level I would expect to see in a Godzilla
game, and I was kind of mad that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to play it earlier. The music was
the Earth theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found it strange that a level fitting a Godzilla game would show up this late.
But there&amp;rsquo;s no point crying over split milk, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved Solomon over to a gray-ish green icon, which turned out to be a giant
high-tech Laboratory of some sort:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/lab1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of mechanical drones in this level, but Solomon cleared through them just
like the White Temple enemies. The music was a gritty, industrial beat. There
was also a strange, flying cyborg enemy, which was annoying because it would fly
away when you jumped to attack it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of interest were these large stasis tanks, holding some kind of monster
inside. As you would guess, sometimes the monsters awaken and shatter through
the glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to get past the stasis tanks as fast as possible, because the monsters
inside proved to be vicious little bastards upon release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the level was an elevator, which I used to go down to the bottom
the level where the exit was. Along the way, I was shot at by security drones. I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t leave the elevator, so my only defense was the heat beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last level type was this simple thing that I call the &amp;ldquo;Heart Temple&amp;rdquo;, for
obvious reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/heartemple.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing but a big hallway, filled with floating enemies shaped like human
hearts. They&amp;rsquo;re incapable of causing you damage, so what you do is run through
the level smashing as many as you can to get all the power-ups. One run through
these levels would get the life meter back up to full, and I would greatly
appreciate these levels later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Heart Temple&amp;rsquo;s music reminded me of a circus tune, had an overly cheerful
sound to it which gave the level a really weird feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having seen all the level types, I chose to fight Gorosaurus using Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/goro1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music for this fight was Gezora&amp;rsquo;s theme. It was during this fight I realized
that Solomon is overpowered: a single well aimed slash can take down as many as
four of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s life bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/goro2-1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to this, the fight was over very quickly. Gorosaurus had no projectile
attacks, or anything else that could match Solomon&amp;rsquo;s deadly claws. But I kept
the fight going just long enough to see if Gorosaurus would use his iconic
&amp;ldquo;Kangaroo Kick&amp;rdquo;, and I was greatly pleased when he did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I knew Solomon was my fighting ace, I used Godzilla to battle
Kumonga, just for variety. I briefly considered using Mothra, but of course
Godzilla won out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/kumonga1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumonga was also a simple opponent, no heat beams or anything. He attacks by
jumping on you, stabbing with his mandibles, and also uses his signature webbing
stream to paralyze you. Once you get webbed, Kumonga will sometimes take the
opportunity to attack, but it&amp;rsquo;s mostly a way to buy some time, like Gezora
backing you in the corner until the time runs out. His music was Hedorah&amp;rsquo;s
theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Gorosaurus and Kumonga defeated I was at the end of Extus. Before I fought
Not-Ghidorah, there was something I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting much from it, but for documentation&amp;rsquo;s sake I took a look at
the other TV Screen. This is what it was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/mrfaucet.gif&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think there ever was much reason behind the Tv Screens. If I were to
guess, I&amp;rsquo;d say its some random, uncontrolled manifestation of the cartridge&amp;rsquo;s
abilities. Or maybe all this makes perfect sense to the &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo;. Who knows.
Anyway, Mr. Faucet&amp;rsquo;s theme was the Saturn music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time for the opponent I had been dreading: Not-Ghidorah. Although I had
gained courage with Solomon&amp;rsquo;s combat advantages, I was still nervous. And when I
started the fight, I was immediately confused:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My opponent was Not-Gezora. I defeated the imposter with a few strikes, and then
Not-Moguera appeared. The it made sense; In order to get to Not-Ghidorah, I had
to battle all the previous Replacements first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And battle them I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tore my way through them until I finally made it to Not-Ghidorah who was&amp;hellip; a
Dorat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I stopped laughing, I destroyed him with only two slashes. The music
stopped, and I thought I was going back to the board. But the battle wasn&amp;rsquo;t over
yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real fight was against the Chimera, a monstrous hybrid of all the
Replacement beasts. This was by far the most difficult boss yet, every attack of
his would cut down whole life bars per use, while attacks against him were
greatly weakened. Solomon&amp;rsquo;s slash for example, was now lucky to take away one
half a life bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this battle I gained a great appreciation for two things: The Boss Fight
Time Limit, and the Heart Temple. Had it not been for those things, I might
never have beaten this boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take down this behemoth, I came up with a strategy. I would switch between
Godzilla and Solomon, as one began to get dangerously low on health, I would
take him through the Heart Temple, while fighting Chimera with the other. I
should count my blessings that Chimera couldn&amp;rsquo;t regain lost health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very interesting thing about Chimera was that the colored sections on his body
corresponded to his different body parts, so each body part effectively had its
own life meter. The head was invincible as long as the other parts were present,
and would always be the last part to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being difficult, it was also the longest fight so far. I tried to
remember how many times I got taken out of the fight by the timer, but I lost
count around thirteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I had destroyed all components but the head, which now flew around on
its own at an incredible speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimera fought well, but I was extremely determined and once he was reduced to a
head, he no longer had the power to defeat Solomon, and I heat beamed him into
oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then Chimera was no more. I was exhausted after that drawn out fight, and
worried that might affect my performance in the End-World chase level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Headquarters icon was replaced, but not by the Hell Beast Face. Instead, it
was a crucifix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was completely stunned. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t excited about seeing the Hell Beast icon
again, but if there was only one good thing about those levels, it&amp;rsquo;s that they
were predictable. I had a basic idea of what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, here I was at the end and the icon was completely different. What did
it mean? And why a crucifix? It made me very uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to start the level with Solomon, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t. I got this notice
that simply stated &amp;ldquo;SOLOMON CAN&amp;rsquo;T ENTER HERE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/Nogo-1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t say why. But I think maybe it has to do with Solomon&amp;rsquo;s demonic
appearance. Since Solomon was out of the question, I went with Godzilla instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I saw the level, the crucifix made sense&amp;mdash;the level was a graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/Graveyard.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was still on edge, thinking this was some kind of trick. The last level had
always involved running from the demonic beast, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be fooled
into thinking this would be any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started out running, but after a minute without interruption, I slowed
down. It was during this time that the music caught my attention. I knew it
sounded familiar when I first heard it, but it took a while before I realized
what it was&amp;mdash;An 8-bit rendition of &lt;em&gt;Prayer For Peace&lt;/em&gt;, from the first Godzilla
film. A very sad, powerful song, even in this form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At two minutes into the level, I encountered something that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to
react to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/13968032467da1eacae02c7546e7fe9e6a83575e.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Angel&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was to run, but this blue statue-esque being simply floated in
place. And I felt compelled just to stare at it, for a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was a grave, and it was floating over a chapel, I guessed that this
was some kind of Angel, watching over the deceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gave me a strange, but warm feeling. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;happy&amp;rdquo;, but I felt that
I was at peace, somehow. I had never seen this being before, yet it seemed very
familiar to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I was going to leave, The Hell Beast appeared, and it&amp;rsquo;s presence warped
the music into a terrifying discordant screeching and transformed the level,
desecrating the tombstones as a new ground appeared, comprised of blood soaked
bodies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could feel my heart now beating out of control, I had no chance of escape with
the monster that close! It lunged for the kill, but the Angel got in its way.
The demon roared and started clawing through the Angel&amp;rsquo;s leg, and tears of blood
streamed from its eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-6-extus/1396947581de67e2709833aac2e066e9be91d82c.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to save the Angel, but there was nothing I could do. I had to honor its
sacrifice and run. And so I ran through the hellish landscape as fast I could.
The beast soon caught up with me, still swallowing the body of the Angel, whose
legs it had torn off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this sight made my terror change into anger. I now found myself hating this
horrible monster. There was no doubt in my mind that it was pure evil, and I
wanted it to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the end, I remembered how it responded to my insult in Trance, I
spoke to it and said: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to pay&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was its response:&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Kindergarten my mother had elected to drive me to school; we were both nervous and she wanted to be there with me all the way up to the moment I walked into class. It took me a bit longer to get ready in the morning due to my still-mending arm. The cast came up a couple inches past my elbow which meant that I had to cover the entire arm with a specially-designed latex bag when I showered. The bag was built to pull tight around the opening in order to seal out any water that might otherwise destroy the cast. I had gotten really adept at cinching the bag myself; that morning, however, perhaps due to my excitement or nervousness, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t pulled the strap tight enough and halfway through the shower I could feel water pooling inside the bag around my fingers. I jumped out and tore the latex shield away, but could feel that the previously rigid plaster had become soft after absorbing the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there is no way to effectively clean the area between your body and a cast, the dead skin that would normally have fallen away merely sits there. When stirred by moisture like sweat it emits an odor, and apparently this odor is proportionate to the amount of moisture introduced, because soon after I began attempting to dry it I was struck by the powerful stench of rot. As I continued to frantically rub it with the towel it began to disintegrate. I was growing increasingly distressed&amp;mdash;I had put as much effort as a child could into his very first day of school. I had sat with my mom picking out my clothes the night before; I had spent a great deal of time picking out my backpack; and I had become exceedingly excited to show everyone my lunchbox that had the Ninja Turtles on it. I had fallen into my mom&amp;rsquo;s habit of calling these children I hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet met my &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; already, but as the condition of my cast worsened, I became deeply upset at the thought that surely I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to apply that label to anyone by the time this day was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defeated, I showed my mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took thirty minutes to get most of the moisture out while working to preserve the rest of the cast. To address the problem of the smell my mom cut slivers off a bar of soap and slid them down into the cast, and then rubbed the remainder of the soap on the outside in an attempt to cocoon the rancid smell inside of a more pleasant one. By the time we arrived at the school my classmates were already engaged in their second activity and I was shoehorned into one of the groups. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t made very clear on what the guidelines of the activity were and within about five minutes, I had violated the rules so badly that each member of the group complained to the teacher and asked why I had to be in their group. I had brought a marker to school in hopes that I could collect some signatures or drawings on my cast next to my mother&amp;rsquo;s, and I suddenly felt very foolish for having even put the marker in my pocket that morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindergarteners had the lunchroom to themselves at my elementary school, but some of the tables were off limits, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to sit alone. I was self-consciously picking at the fraying ends of my cast when a kid sat across from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like your lunchbox,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could tell he was making fun of me, and I grew really angry; in my mind that lunchbox was the last good thing about my day. I didn&amp;rsquo;t look up from my arm, and I felt a burning in my eyes from the tears that I was holding back. I looked up to tell the kid to leave me alone, but before I could get the words out I saw something that made me pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had the exact same lunchbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed. &amp;ldquo;I like your lunchbox, too!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s the coolest,&amp;rdquo; he said while miming nunchuck moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the middle of rebutting by saying that Raphael was my favorite when he knocked his open carton of milk off the table and onto his lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried very hard to stifle my laughter since I didn&amp;rsquo;t know him at all, but the struggling look on my face must have struck him as funny because he started laughing first. Suddenly, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel so bad about my cast, and thought that this person would hardly notice now anyway. Just then, I thought to try my luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey! Do you wanna sign my cast?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I pulled out the marker he asked me how I broke it. I told him that I fell out of the tallest tree in my neighborhood; he seemed impressed. I watched him laboriously draw his name, and when he was done I asked him what it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me it said &amp;ldquo;Josh&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh and I had lunch together every day, and whenever we could we partnered up for projects. I helped him with his handwriting, and he took the blame when I wrote &amp;ldquo;Fart!&amp;rdquo; on the wall in permanent marker. I would come to know other kids, but I think I knew even then that Josh was my only real friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving a friendship outside of school when you are five years old is actually more difficult than most remember. The day we launched our balloons we had such a good time that I asked Josh if he wanted to come to my house the next day to play. He said he did and that he&amp;rsquo;d bring some of his toys; I said that we could also go exploring and maybe swim in the lake. When I got home, I asked my mom and she said it would be fine. My enthusiasm was boundless until I realized that I had no way of contacting Josh to tell him. I spent the whole weekend worrying that our friendship would be dissolved by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw him after the weekend I was relieved to find that he had run into the same obstacle and thought it was funny. Later that week we both remembered to write down our phone numbers at home and then exchange them at school. My mom spoke with Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad, and it was decided that my mom would pick up Josh and myself from school that Friday. We alternated this basic structure nearly every weekend; the fact that we lived so close made things much easier on our parents, who seemed to work constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my mom and I moved across the city at the end of first grade, I was sure that our friendship had seen its last day; as we drove away from the house I had lived in my whole life I felt a sadness that I knew wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about a house&amp;mdash;I was saying goodbye to my friend forever. But, Josh and I&amp;mdash;to my surprise and delight&amp;mdash;stayed close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that we spent the majority of our time apart and only saw one another on weekends, we remained remarkably similar as we grew. Our personalities coalesced, our senses of humor complemented each other&amp;rsquo;s, and we would often find that we had started liking new things independently. We even sounded enough alike that when I stayed with Josh he would sometimes call my mom pretending to be me; his success rate was impressive. My mom would sometimes joke that the only way she could tell us apart sometimes was by our hair&amp;mdash;he had straight, dirty-blonde hair like his sister, while I had curly, dark brown hair like my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would think that the thing most likely to drive two young friends apart would be what&amp;rsquo;s out of their control; however, I think the catalyst of our gradual disengagement was my insistence that we sneak out to my old house to look for Boxes. The next weekend I invited Josh over to my house, in keeping with our tradition of alternating houses, but he said that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t really feeling up to it. We started seeing progressively less of one another over the next year or so; it had gone from once a week, to once a month, to once every couple months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my twelfth birthday, my mom threw a party for me. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t made that many friends since we&amp;rsquo;d moved, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a surprise party since my mom had no idea who to invite. I told the handful of kids I&amp;rsquo;d become acquainted with and called Josh to see if he wanted to come. Originally, he said that he didn&amp;rsquo;t think he could make it, but the day before the party he called me to say that he&amp;rsquo;d be there. I was really excited because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen him in several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party went pretty well. My biggest concern was that Josh and the other kids wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get along, but they seemed to like each other well enough. Josh was surprisingly quiet. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t brought me a gift and apologized for that, but I told him it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal&amp;mdash;I was just glad that he was able to make it. I tried to start several conversations with him, but they seemed to keep reaching dead ends. I asked him what was wrong; I told him that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get why things had become so awkward between us&amp;mdash;they were never like that before. We used to hang out almost every weekend and talk on the phone every couple days. I asked him what happened to us. He looked up from staring at his shoes and just said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You left.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after he said that my mom yelled in from the other room that it was time to open presents. I forced a smile and walked into the dining room as they sang &amp;ldquo;Happy Birthday&amp;rdquo;. There were a couple of wrapped boxes and a lot of cards since most of my extended family lived out of state. Most of the gifts were silly and forgettable, but I remember that Brian gave me a Mighty Max toy shaped like a snake that I kept for years afterwards. My mom was insistent that I open all the cards that had been brought and thank each person who had given one, because several years before on Christmas, I had torn through the wrapping paper and envelopes with such fervor that I had destroyed any possibility of discerning who had sent which gift or what amount of money. We separated the ones that had been sent by mail and the ones that had been brought that day so my friends wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to sit through me opening cards from people they had never met. Most of the cards from my friends had a couple dollars in them, and the ones from my family members contained larger bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One envelope didn&amp;rsquo;t have my name written on it, but it was in the pile so I opened it. The card had a generic floral pattern on its face and seemed to be a card that had been received by someone else who was now recycling it for my birthday because it was actually a little dingy. I actually appreciated the idea that it was a reused card since I&amp;rsquo;d always thought that cards were silly. I angled it so that the money wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fall to the floor when I opened it, but the only thing inside was the message that had come printed in the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Love You.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever had given me this card hadn&amp;rsquo;t written anything in it, but they had circled the message in pencil a couple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chuckled a little and said, &amp;ldquo;Gee, thanks for the awesome card, mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked at me quizzically and then turned her attention to the card. She told me it wasn&amp;rsquo;t from her and seemed amused as she showed my friends, looking at their faces trying to discern who had played the joke. None of the kids stepped forward, so my mom said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry sweetheart, at least you know now that two people love you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She followed that with an extremely prolonged and excruciating kiss on my forehead that transformed the group&amp;rsquo;s bewilderment into hysteria. They were all laughing so it could have been any of them, but Mike seemed to be laughing the hardest. To become a participant rather than the subject of the gag, I said to him that just because he had given me that card he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t think that I&amp;rsquo;d kiss him later. We all laughed, and as I looked at Josh I saw he was finally smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, I think that gift might be the winner, but you have a couple more to open.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom slid another present in front of me. I was still feeling the tremors of suppressed chuckles in my abdomen as I tore the colorful paper away. When I saw the gift I had no need to suppress the laughter anymore. My smile dropped as I looked at what I&amp;rsquo;d been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pair of walkie-talkies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well go on! Show everyone!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held them up, and everyone seemed to approve, but as I drew my attention to Josh I could see that he had turned a sickly shade of white. We locked eyes for a moment and then he turned and walked into the kitchen. As I watched him dial a number on the corded phone attached to the wall my mom whispered in my ear that she knew that Josh and I didn&amp;rsquo;t talk as much since one of the walkie-talkies had broken, so she thought I&amp;rsquo;d like it. I was filled with an intense appreciation for my mom&amp;rsquo;s thoughtfulness, but this feeling was easily overpowered by the emotions resurrected by the returning memories I&amp;rsquo;d tried so hard to bury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone was eating cake, I asked Josh who he had called. He told me he wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling well so he called his dad to come get him. I understood that he wanted to leave, but I told him that I wished we could hang out more. I extended one of the walkie-talkies to him, but he put his hand up in refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dejected, I said, &amp;ldquo;Well, thanks for coming, I guess. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll see you before my next birthday.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll try to call you back more often. I really will,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation stagnated as we waited by my door for his dad. I looked at his face. Josh seemed genuinely remorseful that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t made more of an effort. His mood seemed suddenly bolstered by an idea that had struck him. He told me that he knew what he&amp;rsquo;d get me for my birthday&amp;mdash;it would take a while, but he thought that I would really like it. I told him it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal, but he insisted. He seemed in better spirits and apologized for being such a drag at my party. He said that he was tired&amp;mdash;that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been sleeping well. I asked him why that was as he opened the door in response to his dad&amp;rsquo;s honking in the driveway. He turned back toward me and waved goodbye as he answered my question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been sleepwalking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the last time I saw my friend, and a couple months later he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past several weeks the relationship between my mother and I has grown increasing strained due to my attempts to learn the details of my childhood. It&amp;rsquo;s often the case that one cannot know the breaking point of a thing until that thing fractures, and after the last conversation with my mother I imagine that we will spend the rest of our lives attempting to repair what had taken a lifetime to build. She had put so much energy into keeping me safe, both physically and psychologically, but I think that the walls meant to insulate me from harm were also protecting her emotional stability. As the truth came pouring out the last time we spoke, I could hear a trembling in her voice that I think was a reverberation of the collapse of her world. I don&amp;rsquo;t imagine my mother and I will talk very much anymore, and while there are still some things I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, I think I know enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Josh disappeared, his parents had done all that they could to find him. From the very first day, the police had suggested that they contact all of Josh&amp;rsquo;s friends&amp;rsquo; parents to see if he was with them. They did this, of course, but no one had seen him or had any idea of where he might be. The police had been unable to turn over any new information about Josh&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts, despite the fact that they had received several anonymous phone calls from a woman urging them to compare this case with the stalking case that had been opened about six years before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Josh&amp;rsquo;s mother&amp;rsquo;s grip on the world loosened when her son vanished, it broke when Veronica died. She had seen many people die at the hospital, but there is no amount of desensitization that can fortify a person against the death of her own child. She would visit Veronica twice a day since she was recuperating at a different hospital; once before her shift, and once afterward. On the day Veronica died, her mother was late leaving work, and by the time she arrived at her daughter&amp;rsquo;s hospital, Veronica had already passed. This was too much for her and over the next couple weeks she became increasingly more unstable; she would often wander outside yelling for both Josh and Veronica to come home, and there were several times her husband found her wandering around my old neighborhood in the middle of the night – half-clothed and frantically searching for her son and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to his wife&amp;rsquo;s mental deterioration, Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad could no longer travel for work and began taking construction jobs that were less well-paying, so he could be closer to home. When they began expanding my old neighborhood more, about three months after Veronica died, Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad applied for every position and was hired. He was qualified to lead the build sites, but he took a job as a laborer helping to build frames and clean up the sites and whatever else was needed. He even took odd jobs that would occasionally come up; mowing lawns, repairing fences&amp;mdash;anything that to keep from traveling. They began clearing the woods in the area next to the tributary to transform the land into inhabitable property. Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad was tasked with the responsibility of leveling the recently deforested lot, and this job guaranteed him at least several weeks of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day, he arrived at a spot that he could not level. Each time he&amp;rsquo;d drive over it, it would remain lower than all the surrounding land. Frustrated, he got off the machine to survey the area. He was tempted to simply pack more dirt into the depression, but he knew that would only be an aesthetic and temporary solution. He had worked construction for years and knew that root systems from large trees that had been recently cut down would often decompose, leaving weaknesses in the soil that would manifest as weaknesses in the foundations above. He weighed his options and elected to dig a little with a shovel in case the problem was shallow enough to fix without needing a machine that would have to be brought over from another site. And as my mother described where this was, I knew I had been at that spot both before the soil was broken and before it had been filled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a tightening in my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dug a small hole about three feet down until his shovel collided with something hard. He smashed his shovel against it repeatedly in an attempt to gauge the thickness of the root and the density of the network when suddenly his shovel plunged through the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confused, he dug the hole wider. After about a half-hour of excavating, he found himself standing on a brown blanket-covered box about seven feet long and four feet wide. Our minds work to avoid dissonance&amp;mdash;if we hold a belief strongly enough, our minds will forcefully reject conflicting evidence so that we can maintain the integrity of our understanding of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until the very next moment, despite what all sense would have indicated&amp;mdash;despite the fact that some small but suffocated part of him understood what was supporting his weight&amp;mdash;this man believed, he knew, his son was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom received a call at 6 PM. She knew who it was, but she couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand what he was saying. But what she did comprehend made her leave immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;DOWN HERE &amp;hellip; NOW &amp;hellip; SON &amp;hellip; PLEASE GOD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she arrived she found Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad sitting perfectly still with his back to the hole. He was holding the shovel so tightly it seemed that it might snap, and he was staring straight ahead with eyes that looked as lifeless as a shark&amp;rsquo;s. He wouldn&amp;rsquo;t respond to any of her words, and only reacted when she tried to gently take the shovel from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dragged his eyes slowly to hers and just said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&amp;rdquo; He repeated this as if he had forgotten all other words, and my mother could hear him still muttering it as she walked past him to look in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told me she wished she had gouged her eyes out before she faced downward into that crater, and I told her that I knew what she was about to say and that she need not continue. I looked at her face and it was expressing a look of such intense despair that it caused my stomach to turn. I realized that she had known of this for almost ten years and was hoping that she&amp;rsquo;d never have to tell me. As a result, she never came up with the proper arrangement of words to describe what she saw, and as I sit here I&amp;rsquo;m met with the same difficulty of articulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh was dead. His face was sunken in and contorted in such a way that it was as if the misery and hopelessness of all the world had been transferred to it. The assaulting smell of decay rose from the crypt, and my mother had to cover her nose and mouth to keep from vomiting. His skin was cracked, almost crocodilian, and a stream of blood that had followed these lines had dried on his face after pooling and staining the wood around his head. His eyes lay half-lidded facing straight up. She said by the look of him, he had not been long-dead, and thus time had not brought the mercy of degradation to erase the pain and terror that was now etched into his face. She said it was as if he had fixed his gaze right on her, his open mouth offering an all-too-late plea for help. The rest of his body, however, wasn&amp;rsquo;t visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone else was covering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was large and lay face-down on top of Josh, and as my mother&amp;rsquo;s mind stretched itself to take in what her eyes were attempting to tell her, she became aware of the significance of the way in which he laid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was holding Josh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their legs lay frozen by death, but entangled like vines in some lush, tropical forest. One arm rested under Josh&amp;rsquo;s neck only to wrap around his body so that they might lay closer still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun passed through the trees, its light became reflected by something pinned to Josh&amp;rsquo;s shirt. My mother stooped to one knee and raised the collar of her shirt over her nose so that she might block out the smell. When she saw what had caught the sun her legs abandoned her and she nearly fell into the tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a picture&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a picture of me as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She staggered backwards, gasping and trembling and collided with Josh&amp;rsquo;s father who still sat facing away from the hole. She understood why he had called her, but she could not bring herself to tell him what she had kept from everyone for all these years. Josh&amp;rsquo;s family never knew about the night I had woken up in the woods. She knew now that she should have told them, but to tell him now would help nothing. As she sat there resting her back against Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad&amp;rsquo;s. He spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t tell my wife. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell her that our little boy&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; his speech staggered in fits as he pressed his wet face into his dirt-caked hands. &amp;ldquo;She couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear it&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a moment, he stood up, still shuddering and lumbered toward the grave. With a final sob, he stepped down into the coffin. Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad was a big man, but not as big as the man in the box. He grabbed the back of the man&amp;rsquo;s collar and pulled hard&amp;mdash;it was as if he intended to throw the man out of the grave in a singular motion. But the collar ripped and the body fell back down on top of his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;YOU MOTHER FUCKER!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grabbed the man by the shoulders and heaved him back until he was off of Josh and sat awkwardly but upright against the wall of the grave. He looked at the man and staggered back a step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh God &amp;hellip; Oh God, no. No, no, no please God, PLEASE GOD NO.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a struggling but powerful movement, he lifted and pushed the corpse completely out of the ground and they both heard the sound of glass rolling against wood. It was a bottle. He handed it to my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was ether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh Josh,&amp;rdquo; he sobbed. &amp;ldquo;My boy &amp;hellip; my baby boy. Why is there so much blood?! WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my mother looked at the man who now lay facing upwards, she realized she was facing the person who had haunted our lives for over a decade. She had imagined him so many times, always evil and always terrifying, and the cries of Josh&amp;rsquo;s father seemed to confirm her worst fears. But as she stared at his face, she thought that this didn&amp;rsquo;t look like who she imagined&amp;mdash;this was just a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she looked at his frozen expression, it actually looked serene. The corners of his lips were turned up only slightly; she saw that he was smiling. Not the expected smile of a maniac from a film or horror story; not the smile of a demon, or the smile of a fiend. This was the smile of contentment or satisfaction. It was a smile of bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a smile of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she looked down from his face she saw a tremendous wound on his neck from where the skin had been ripped out. She was at first relieved when she realized that the blood had not been Josh&amp;rsquo;s. Perhaps he had suffered less. But this comfort was short-lived as she realized just how wrong she was. She brought a hand up to her mouth and whispered, almost as if she was afraid to remind the world what had happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They were alive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh must have bitten the man&amp;rsquo;s neck in an attempt to get free, and although the man had died, Josh couldn&amp;rsquo;t move him. I began crying when I thought of how long he might have laid there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked through the man&amp;rsquo;s pockets for some kind of identification, but she only found a piece of paper. On it was a drawing of a man holding hands with a small boy and next to the boy were initials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that she was remembering that part of the story inaccurately, but I&amp;rsquo;ll never know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Josh&amp;rsquo;s father carried his son out of the grave, my mom slid the piece of paper into her pocket. He kept muttering that his son&amp;rsquo;s hair had been dyed. She saw that it had&amp;mdash;it was now dark brown, and she noticed that he was dressed oddly; his clothes were all far too small. After Josh&amp;rsquo;s dad delicately laid his boy on the soft dirt, he began gently pressing his hands against his son&amp;rsquo;s pants to feel his pockets; he heard a crinkle. Carefully, he retrieved a folded piece of paper from Josh&amp;rsquo;s pocket. He looked at it but was vexed. Absently, he handed it to my mother, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize it either. I asked her what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told me it was a map, and I felt my heart shatter. He was finishing the map&amp;mdash;that must have been his idea for my birthday present. I found myself strangely hoping that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been taken while expanding it – as if that would somehow matter now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She heard Josh&amp;rsquo;s father grunt and looked to see him pushing the man&amp;rsquo;s body back into the ground. As he walked back toward the machine that had found this spot for him, he put his hand on a canister of gasoline and paused with his back toward my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You should go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not your fault. I did this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t think like that. There was nothi&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He interjected flatly, almost with no emotion at all. &amp;ldquo;About a month ago, a guy approached me as I was cleaning up the site on the new development a block over. He asked me if I wanted to make some extra money, and because my wife&amp;rsquo;s not working right now, I accepted. He told me that some kids had dug a bunch of holes on his property and he offered me a hundred dollars to fill them in. He said that he wanted to take some pictures for the insurance company first, but if I came back after 5:00 PM, the next day, that would be fine. I thought this guy was a sucker since I knew clearing that lot was coming up so someone would&amp;rsquo;ve had to do it anyway, but I needed the money so I agreed. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he even had a hundred dollars, but he put the bill in my hand, and I did the job the next day. I&amp;rsquo;ve been so exhausted that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even think about it after it was done. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think about it until today when I pulled that same guy off of my son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed at the grave and his emotions started to push through as he broke into a sob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He paid me a hundred dollars so that I would bury him with my boy&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as if saying it aloud forced him to accept what had happened, and he collapsed onto the ground in tears. My mother could think of nothing to say and stood there in silence for what felt like a lifetime. She finally asked what he would do about Josh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;His final resting place won&amp;rsquo;t be here with this monster.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she looked back when she reached her car, she could see black smoke billowing and diffusing against the amber sky and she hoped against all hope that Josh&amp;rsquo;s parents would be ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left my mom&amp;rsquo;s house without saying much else. I told her that I loved her and that I would talk to her soon, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know what &amp;ldquo;soon&amp;rdquo; means for us. I got into my car and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood now why the events of my childhood had stopped years ago. As an adult, I now saw the connections that were lost on a child who tends to see the world in snapshots rather than a sequence. I thought about Josh. I loved him then, and I love him even still. I miss him more now that I know I&amp;rsquo;ll never see him again, and I find myself wishing that I had hugged him the last time I saw him. I thought about Josh&amp;rsquo;s parents&amp;mdash;how much they had lost and how quickly that loss had come. They don&amp;rsquo;t know about my connection to any of this, but I could never look them in the eyes now. I thought about Veronica. I had only really come to know her later in my life, but for those brief few weeks I think I had really loved her. I thought about my mother. She had tried so hard to protect me and was stronger than I would ever be. I tried not to think about the man and what he had done with Josh for more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly I just thought about Josh. Sometimes I wish that he never sat across from me that day in Kindergarten; that I&amp;rsquo;d never known what it was like to have a real friend. Sometimes I like to dream that he&amp;rsquo;s in a better place, but that&amp;rsquo;s only a dream, and I know that. The world is a cruel place made crueler still by man. There would be no justice for my friend, no final confrontation, no vengeance; it had been over for almost a decade for everyone but me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss you, Josh. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry you chose me, but I&amp;rsquo;ll always cherish my memories of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were explorers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We were friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Part Seven</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few months were uneventful. Once again I felt like I had hit a dead end. I took a break from the mission and focused on life obligations. I had just managed to comfortably put the Lost Episode search on the backburner and feel contented when I received an email with the subject &amp;ldquo;What You&amp;rsquo;ve Been Looking For.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hesitated a good few minutes before opening the message. &amp;ldquo;Hello. If you want answers, meet me at this address and time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart raced. This email wasn&amp;rsquo;t from any of the addresses I had messaged. I instinctively felt I was about to finally get closure, and was suddenly terrified. Perhaps even more terrified than I had been at any point before in this journey, more than when I was run off the road, more than when I was hypnotized by a cartoon lion, more than when I had been threatened through the TV in a motel room. My hands were shaking so much I could hardly use the keyboard to navigate to a new tab and look up the address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an empty lot from an abandoned building that had been razed years ago. The Google Maps street view looked somewhat foreboding, but it was within comfortable driving distance of my apartment, which terrified me even more to realize the sender knew what city I lived in. Still, I asked off work for the specified date (and was racked with dread until it arrived, barely able to concentrate on my job) and drove to the lot three hours ahead of time, parking my car in the street as was typical for the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a sunny spring day, and the wind made me uncomfortable despite the warm weather. Each passing car made me apprehensive, particularly the ones that appeared to slow down. I had an overwhelming urge to drive away as the appointed time drew near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the car stopped at the lot exactly at the time, I was surprised to see a woman get out. She had cropped red hair and appeared to be in her early 40s. She was wearing a black leather jacket and walked right up to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled slightly. &amp;ldquo;Hi, you can call me Cathy. I&amp;rsquo;m from the group you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swallowed and rendered a quiet greeting. She didn&amp;rsquo;t look threatening. I had trouble imagining what could have possessed her to join an organization like the Lost Media Group, but right now I had other things to be concerned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a setup,&amp;rdquo; she reassured, reading my apprehension. &amp;ldquo;If we wanted to do you in, we could have and would have done it already.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So then what do you want?&amp;rdquo; I interjected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We want you to stop looking into us,&amp;rdquo; she stated plainly. &amp;ldquo;And to that end I managed to convince the higher-ups to let me show you what you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for so that you, and we, can put this behind us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You mean the &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; video?&amp;rdquo; I asked. She nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For security reasons, we obviously can&amp;rsquo;t just give it to you. The best I could arrange was for you to be allowed to see it, under supervision, at one of the abandoned movie theaters we use to give private viewings of our works for select patrons. We&amp;rsquo;re about to leave that location anyway, and needless you say, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even think about telling people we were ever there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded and grunted. If it meant finally getting answers, I was willing to put up with a little more bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hope you have the whole day free, because the theater is several hours away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded again, suspecting that she already knew the answer. We got in her car and were off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove in silence for the first hour or so. Then I asked her why the group made lost episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She waited a few moments before answering. &amp;ldquo;Well, I guess you could say we aim to challenge the status quo of programming, and give animators a chance to really test their limits. That&amp;rsquo;s why I joined when the organization invited me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And why do you leak them to the public if you want to keep them secret?&amp;rdquo; I prodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t leak them. Sometimes they just get out and people who weren&amp;rsquo;t intended to see them do. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how you ended up seeing one of our works as a kid, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And what about the Kabetogama Broadcast?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some member of our organization was messing around when he wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to, or maybe it was a TV broadcast only intended to be seen by members back when we were a little more lax about security. Look, I said we&amp;rsquo;d show you what you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for. Beyond that, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;m not at liberty to satisfy your curiosity about our inner-workings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was silent for a few more minutes. Her answers were suspect. The Lost Media Group seemed like the type of group that would find pleasure in shocking and traumatizing random people with their twisted &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo;, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite buy that all exposure to non-insiders was unintentional. I thought back to the FBI report. I also wondered if she was completely happy with the choice she had made to join the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen part of your &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; edit recently,&amp;rdquo; I finally said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathy pursed her lips, and I could see in her eyes that she was briefly considering whether it was worth trying to pretend she didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was talking about. She decided against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, sorry about that I guess, but I guess they figured if we gave you a good scare you might give up and leave us alone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was annoyed at her choice of words, as if they were the ones who only wanted to be left at peace all that time. I could only wonder if it had been her idea. I also wondered if she knew I had seen several of their other projects as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you visited Strobl&amp;rsquo;s old studio, that was when we decided it was time to make a peace offering to get you off our back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theater appeared to be one of those many theaters that had been opened during the 90s blockbuster boom and then abandoned during the 2000s. It was along the interstate, isolated from any other buildings. We entered through a side door Cathy had a key for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lobby was unlit except for the sun outside. I could see a ticket counter, a concessions area, and posters for old blockbusters on the wall. Covering the floor was carpeting of a faded colorful pattern. Adjacent to the small food court was an empty room that I guessed used to be the video arcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathy told me to give her my phone, which I did. She then escorted me down the gallery hallway, to the last gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked me if I was sure I wanted to see this. I answered yes, and she said I could sit anywhere I wanted. I chose a seat near the back while she went up to run the projector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began feeling scared. Sitting there in the dark abandoned gallery was very reminiscent of sitting in the dark watching &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt; all those years ago, except that all the extra space made it even more ominous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the feature started, I could tell immediately that the audio was off. It sounded shrieky and low-quality. Otherwise, the movie was normal up until the point when the butler decided to get rid of the cats. Instead of drugging them and leaving them abandoned like in the normal movie, he drowned them in the river. It went downhill from there. Suddenly I was a five-year-old boy again, watching in horror as characters were mutilated, decapitated, and burned, all while strange visual and audio effects were applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;float-right&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly shocking scene featured real footage of cats attacking and killing a man. In real time, lines were drawn over the scene, covering it in sketchwork until it had become a completely animated version of itself. It was done with such absolute perfection of technique that I was sure Strobl must have done that bit himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually got a grip and was able to sit through the rest of the thing calmly. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t pleasant, but I was at least relieved to finally be getting it over with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was over, I think I had tears in my eyes. &amp;ldquo;Cathy&amp;rdquo; drove me back to the empty lot, and it was dark by the time we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I got out, she spoke to me one last time. &amp;ldquo;Now listen to me, you&amp;rsquo;ve found what you were looking for. And now that you have, you need to let it go. I took a big risk even pushing to let you in behind the scenes for that brief moment. If you continue pursuing information about our organization, we will have to take more drastic measures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We exchanged goodbyes, and she drove off. For years I kept my end of the agreement to never speak a word about our encounter to anyone. However, recently I have been reconsidering the bargain. A few days ago, someone reached out to me on the Web asking me for information on Lost Episodes. They claim to have seen one as a child and are hoping to find closure for their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m debating with myself whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth letting them in on the secret, or if it would be better for their own sake if I convinced them they imagined the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recovering from an injury sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering from an injury when you can&amp;rsquo;t fall asleep sucks worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering from an injury when you can&amp;rsquo;t fall asleep while simultaneously being hunted by a sociopathic lackie of a dark god with a personal vendetta against you sucks even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what sucks even more worse is having to do all of the above and still being called in to work because, as the owners put it, the new guy is &amp;ldquo;a complete and total moron with willful and malicious idiocy that borders on the criminal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I am here, against the doctors&amp;rsquo; advice, at the shitty gas station at the edge of town, only a little worse for the wear. What&amp;rsquo;s really incredible is that I&amp;rsquo;ve only been back for one day and there&amp;rsquo;s already a body count. (More on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My right leg is in a cast from ankle to thigh, and I&amp;rsquo;ve elected to use crutches because, unsurprisingly, the gas station is not wheelchair accessible. The cast has several signatures and messages, which is very strange because I have no memory of anyone signing it. But that could just be a result of the pain meds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking down now, I can see that Diego scrawled this message, &amp;ldquo;Try and stay out of trouble. -D&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a message in red crayon: &amp;ldquo;Jerry was here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few signatures scribbled in sharpie, and a little further up my leg-I have to pull my pants way up to read it-this note: &amp;ldquo;RtRAtC!&amp;rdquo; Hm. Well that&amp;rsquo;s annoyingly cryptic. I would check the tape logs to see who I let get so close to my delicate area, but the owners had every camera in the place removed. I guess there was something about finding that secret room full of security camera feeds to bring personal privacy into the public discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like the act of removing all the security cameras was a bit of an overreaction. Especially with Spencer still out there. The police took a statement and confiscated the remains of the bomb. They&amp;rsquo;re taking this whole thing very seriously, and an arrest warrant is out for Spencer Middleton, should he ever show up again. As for Kieffer, things get a little more interesting. The police were unable to find any evidence that he ever even existed. He had no property in his name, no driver&amp;rsquo;s license, no public record of any kind. The only thing even linking him to this town was a grainy picture in an old yearbook photo. It would seem that Kieffer was living off the grid ever since he graduated high school, and now that Spencer&amp;rsquo;s attempt to blow up the gas station failed, Kieffer has suspended his election campaign and simply disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheriff has been sending a new deputy, Arnold, out to check on me once or twice a day. Arnold isn&amp;rsquo;t from around here, which is probably why he agreed to replace Tom as the new gas station babysitter. He&amp;rsquo;s about 6&#39;2&amp;quot;, dark-skinned, with a moustache thick enough to plant a yard flamingo in. He has eyes that constantly telegraph the sentiment &amp;ldquo;knock that nonsense off!&amp;rdquo; and I have yet to see him smile. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if Arnold will become the next Tom or the next Spencer&amp;hellip; right now he could go either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold was the one that dropped me off at work today. I&amp;rsquo;m not supposed to get back behind a steering wheel for a while, which is fine I guess. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m going on any road trips any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to work, we passed the SUV of the man with the beard. The one staked in place on the side of the road by the tree growing up through its engine. I asked Arnold about it, but he just shrugged it off and said I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry myself with other people&amp;rsquo;s business. I asked him about the owner of the vehicle, and Arnold said that they think he got lost in the woods just like those hikers last fall. A search and rescue effort was under way, and he was confident that they would find him &amp;ldquo;one way or the other.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Arnold dropped me off today, I went about my regular shift-starting duties. I reconciled Marlboro&amp;rsquo;s till, not at all surprised to see that he was somehow $150 over, or that the surplus was entirely in one-dollar coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged all the invoices that had piled up while I was out, then I emptied the trash cans. I was hoping that I might run into the cowboy, but the only thing in the men&amp;rsquo;s room was an obese Hispanic trucker punishing the toilet and surrounding air with an unholy fury that deserves its own scary story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was starting to go down when I hobbled out to the dumpster, balancing garbage bags against my crutches and probably looking like a baby deer learning to walk. You know, if that deer were drunk and two-legged and carrying several bags of garbage. The scorched earth near the dumpster was the same as I had left it: blackened down to the subsoil. Somewhere just past the start of the trees was another patch of smoldered remains, one that I neglected to mention in the police report, one that might look to the casual observer like the remains of a human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I turned to go back in, I noticed something odd on the side of the dumpster. At first, I thought it was a child&amp;rsquo;s toy, stuck to the dirty outside wall. But then I realized that it was moving, breathing, crawling slowly and eating the gooey drippings off the rust of the dumpster. The thing looked like a giant tomato caterpillar, about eight inches long, and as the sun went down I swear I could see the thing give off its own light source. The squishy caterpillar-thing didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to mind my presence, and even let me feed it an old starburst that I had in my pocket. A yellow, because like all people, I hate the yellow starburst. The critter bioluminesced a little brighter as it ate the taffy and I gave it a gentle pet. Its hide wasn&amp;rsquo;t as wet as it appeared. In fact, it seemed to be covered in tiny clear hairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not so bad,&amp;rdquo; I said while it nibbled at the candy. &amp;ldquo;Not everything out here needs to be scary, huh?&amp;rdquo; It wiggled and crawled away to a place on the back of the dumpster with more gunk, and I went back into the gas station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro has taken up smoking again. He&amp;rsquo;d quit for a while, but then explained that the suffering he was causing himself by not smoking grossly outweighed the suffering he was causing us through second-hand smoke, and Mathematically speaking, it didn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense for him to quit. I had hoped that he was beginning to shed his cultist philosophy after the entire compound mysteriously vanished, but now I&amp;rsquo;m starting to fear that he can&amp;rsquo;t be rehabilitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a pretty normal (well not normal, but average) day at the gas station. We had some strange people visit. We had some normal people visit, too. And along the way I zoned out, finished a book I&amp;rsquo;d been reading, made some boring journal entries, and even got online to browse the internet for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another package sitting under the counter, addressed to me from a return address I don&amp;rsquo;t recognize. I took a gamble with the last package and it turned out to be something great. But that was before Spencer tried to kill me, and once again my gut is telling me not to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a phone call today at the store a few hours after sundown. It was pretty late, hard to say when exactly. Marlboro was asleep in his hammock in the dry storage room and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the last customer. This was somewhere in that temporal wasteland between dusk and dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jack, listen very carefully. You don&amp;rsquo;t know me. What I&amp;rsquo;m about to tell you will save your life, but only if you follow my instructions and do exactly what I say. In the drawer to your right is a pencil and paper. Get them, and write this down. These are the rules to your survival.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One. Do not leave the gas station. Do not go outside under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two. Do not drink the tap water. Don&amp;rsquo;t even touch it. Don&amp;rsquo;t smell it. Don&amp;rsquo;t look at it. It&amp;rsquo;s bottled water from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three. Don&amp;rsquo;t trust your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four. Barricade the-&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hang on, hang on, where&amp;rsquo;d you say the pen was?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighed, &amp;ldquo;In a drawer to the right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My right or your right?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your right- how the hell would it by my right? I&amp;rsquo;m on the phone!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then I heard a car horn honk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the old widow Mrs. Sistrunk. She&amp;rsquo;s another local, somewhere in the area of a hundred years old if I had to guess, and at this point not much more than a skeleton wrapped in an ill-fitting skin suit with vibrant lipstick smeared all around the general mouth area. After her husband died, Mrs. Agatha Sistrunk had taken to buying and collecting sports cars and oversized trucks and racing them around the outskirts of town at all hours of the night. Her most recent purchase was a brand-new Ford F-550 with a painting of the Hulk in all of his green smashing glory along the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In person, she was a sweet old lady, no taller than four and half feet. She wore special shoes to reach the gas pedal and always came to this gas station to fill up because she knew I&amp;rsquo;d help her pump her gas, something she had never done before and wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in learning how to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One sec,&amp;rdquo; I said to the voice on the other end of the phone, &amp;ldquo;Be right back. Mrs. Sistrunk needs me to top her off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen to me!&amp;rdquo; The voice growled, &amp;ldquo;Do not go outside! You go outside and you&amp;rsquo;re dead! Do you hear me?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hear what you&amp;rsquo;re saying,&amp;rdquo; I said as I grabbed my crutches and got ready to leave, &amp;ldquo;but I don&amp;rsquo;t work for you.&amp;rdquo; With that, I hung up the phone and went outside to help Mrs. Sistrunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old Agatha was happy to see that I was back at work. Apparently, Marlboro made her nervous. She said he was flirting at her and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stop smoking while he pumped her gas. Before she left, she gave me a case of empty light beers and asked if I would &amp;ldquo;be a lamb and toss these&amp;rdquo; for her. I can&amp;rsquo;t say no to Agatha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got around back to toss her trash, I noticed something incredible. The glow worm from this morning had formed itself into an enormous cocoon against the back of the dumpster. I can&amp;rsquo;t explain why, exactly, but this filled me with some sort of&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know, what means the exact opposite of existential dread? Euphoria? Existential hope? Is this what optimism feels like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense, but seeing the weird garbage-eating caterpillar thing begin the brave journey of transformation gave me this tingling feeling in my soul. Like this was some kind of sign. Just when the caterpillar thought his world had come to an end, he became a butterfly. My world has felt like it was coming to an end for a while too, little buddy. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m also on the verge of a metamorphosis. Maybe the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be strange and scary, maybe it can be strange and cool. I decided that whatever hatched from the cocoon, be it butterfly or moth or monster, I was going to name it Starburst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hobbled myself back to the gas station and tossed one last look over my shoulder at the dumpster to see that one of the racoons was stuffing the cocoon into its mouth. It devoured the whole thing in a couple bites before making eye contact with me and dashing off into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego came into the store for his late shift and asked how I was feeling. I told him that the pain was tolerable. He nodded, like that was the kind of answer he was looking for, and I went back to reading my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, the man with the beard came into the gas station. I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize him as the same man that went off into the woods after the creature he called an &amp;ldquo;anglerfish.&amp;rdquo; He had lost a lot of weight, his beard wasn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as well kept, and he smelled like he bathed in a tub of pee that someone farted in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; I said when he came in. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re still alive! Cool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that the man was holding a pistol when he walked in? The thought crossed my mind for the briefest moment that I wonder what happened to his big gun? I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to ask. He quickly found the locks on the doors, used them, then covered the short distance to my register, gun extended and aimed at my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I told you not to go outside! You&amp;rsquo;re lucky you&amp;rsquo;re even alive!&amp;rdquo; he screamed before grabbing the store phone and yanking it out of the wall. He threw it to the ground with a loud, satisfying smash and asked, &amp;ldquo;Who else is in this building?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well let me see,&amp;rdquo; I said, thinking. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s you, me, and probably the other cashier unless he went into town again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I saw one other car out there. Toyota. That yours?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, that&amp;rsquo;s got to be Diego.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right on cue, Diego walked out from the back and froze at the sight of the bearded man still pointing a gun at my face. Diego might have been tempted to take action, if he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been carrying a 50 lb bag of corn over his shoulder. Instead, he just raised his free hand and said softly, &amp;ldquo;Hey man, we don&amp;rsquo;t want no trouble. If you&amp;rsquo;re after the cash, go ahead and take it. Ain&amp;rsquo;t no heroes here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bearded man laughed in an obnoxious way and said, &amp;ldquo;Well, there&amp;rsquo;s at least one. My name is Benjamin, and I&amp;rsquo;m here to save your sorry asses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego and I made eye contact. A lot can be conveyed in just an instant if you know the person you&amp;rsquo;re looking at. He was trying to see what I wanted to do. I was trying to tell him to relax. This was neither the worst nor the weirdest thing to happen in that room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ok,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;What do you need us to do, Benjamin?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s something evil under this gas station, and nobody is leaving here until I understand what it is. Because I know that someone is working with that thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it. In my dreams. I know you have, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well he was wrong about one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then, Marlboro walked out of the dry storage closet, stretching and yawning. Benjamin snapped him into a chokehold before he knew what was going on and jammed the gun against his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you listening to me?!&amp;rdquo; Benjamin screamed. &amp;ldquo;I just told you that the world as you know it is just a façade! There&amp;rsquo;s a devil here! And one of you is working for him!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at both of us for some kind of reaction, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think he got the one he was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just shrugged and said, &amp;ldquo;Neat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then, Marlboro surprised the pants off of everybody by half yelling half laughing &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s do this! I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid to die!&amp;rdquo; before reaching up, grabbing the gun pressed against his head, and pulling the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of weird stuff working at that shitty gas station. I&amp;rsquo;ve been nearly killed once or twice. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched the same guy die over and over in front of me. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen things that may or may not be real, because I can&amp;rsquo;t dream and sometimes I wonder if my mind is making up for that in other ways. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ball lightning, people with blue skin, a man with two heads, a talking dog, and an Elvis impersonator that may have been a little too convincing. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so much weird stuff in that room. But this was the first time I ever saw a look of surprise like that on anybody&amp;rsquo;s face. And it was absolutely priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;hellip; what the hell is wrong with you people?!&amp;rdquo; Benjamin said, backing away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ain&amp;rsquo;t nothing wrong with us,&amp;rdquo; said Marlboro, relieved to be free from the headlock. &amp;ldquo;What the hell is wrong with your gun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How did you know I was out of ammo?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a loud thud as Diego dropped the sack of corn. He was the next to talk, &amp;ldquo;I think maybe you should get out of here, pal, while you still can.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Afraid I can&amp;rsquo;t do that,&amp;rdquo; Benjamin responded. &amp;ldquo;Not until this thing is dead. And not until I-&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a wet thunk before I saw anything. Before Benjamin went limp and hit the ground. When my eyes caught up to the situation, I hoped that what I was seeing was a hallucination, but the look of fear on Diego&amp;rsquo;s face told me that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case. The man standing behind Benjamin, holding a bloodied shovel, the man that just saved our bacon was smiling a toothy delighted smile that he only ever made after inflicting the kind of pain he&amp;rsquo;d just inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey Jack,&amp;rdquo; said Spencer Middleton. &amp;ldquo;You miss me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stuck Diego and Marlboro in the walk-in freezer. Marlboro is and always has been a go-with-the-flow kind of guy, so he went into the freezer voluntarily. Diego put up a fight, which is why he ended up bruised and bloody and barely clinging to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I could see, Benjamin looked like he might be dead. At best, he was out cold in a slowly spreading pool of his own blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer pulled a couple of chairs out of storage and placed them both in front of the cash register facing one another. He made me hobble over and sit down in one. Then he spun the other around to sit on it backwards, like a cool schoolteacher from the 90&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I just want you to know,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not mad at you. And neither is he. He wanted me to relay that message.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer&amp;rsquo;s face still had specks of blood on it from where he had beaten the shit out of Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your boss?&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah. He was upset at you for what you did to Kieffer, and wanted me to show you what happens to bad children. You were supposed to meet him, but then that got all cocked up, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I guess it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t my time to die.&amp;rdquo; I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when the smile faded from Spencer&amp;rsquo;s face. He shook his head at me and said, &amp;ldquo;Die? No&amp;hellip; no, no, no, you weren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to die. You can&amp;rsquo;t die! We need you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some movement behind Spencer but tried not to break eye contact. It was Benjamin. He was alive, and right now my best shot at getting out of this. He was moving slowly on the ground, regaining consciousness but miraculously not making any noise. I tried to keep Spencer distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your boss. Tell me more about him. How did he find you? Who is he?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer chuckled, &amp;ldquo;Oh, he&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of names. But you&amp;rsquo;ll meet him soon enough. And this time, we will not be interrupted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And my friends?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care. They can join us. They can die. It makes me no difference. By the way, Jack, I wanted to ask: did you guys ever figure out who placed that bomb?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed softly. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, the police took it. They know it was you. They know everything. Well, almost everything. Ok, in the grand scheme of things, they know very little, but they do know that you tried to kill me and you put a bomb in the gas station.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer shook his head again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wrong on both accounts. If I wanted you dead, you&amp;rsquo;d be dead. And a bomb? Seriously? Not my style.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he had more to say to me, but I&amp;rsquo;ll never know, because right then Benjamin yanked his head back and wiped a knife blade the size of a large chihuahua across his neck, neatly slicing his head halfway off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood erupted out in a couple spurts, then stopped, and Spencer Middleton was no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s what you get,&amp;rdquo; taunted Benjamin as he flung Spencer&amp;rsquo;s lifeless body onto the floor, his blood pouring out and mixing with all the rest. It was going to suck for whoever had to clean all of this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we opened the freezer, we found that Marlboro had gone all bad-nurse on Diego, sticking clumps of frozen meat all over his face. &amp;ldquo;For the swelling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made us a fresh pot of coffee and we took seats around the table by the window. Just in case a nosey passer-by decided to pass by, we put a tarp over Spencer and moved the &amp;ldquo;wet floor&amp;rdquo; sign next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about half an hour, we all just sat and drank coffee in a pregnant silence. When we were all done with our third cups, Diego finally spoke. His jaw was swollen to hell, but he was still able to pronounce his words with only minor difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So why haven&amp;rsquo;t we called the cops yet? This was clearly self-defense. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the face to prove it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah,&amp;rdquo; said Benjamin after some lengthy deliberation. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s call them. That would be good. But tomorrow you and me need to have a serious talk, Jack.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called Arnold from the only phone in the building with any reception – Spencer&amp;rsquo;s cell. The deputy listened to what I told him (just the most basic and simplified version of what happened that night) and he said he would be on his way right after he got out of bed and put some clothes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called the owners next, and they were not very happy. They told me next time I should call them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Next time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the others are at their booth, staring out the window. And I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on my laptop documenting the night while the memories are still fresh. I know this isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet. I think the gas station is going to have to close for a day or two. But when it opens again, I&amp;rsquo;ll be here, writing my journals and doing my best to ignore anyone who walks through those doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that means this is to be continued&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the topics that I get asked about a lot, here and in real life, involved things like The Rake, the Wendigo, and other related legends. I can&amp;rsquo;t honestly say that I know a lot about any of them, but based on some light reading I did, I can say that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard stories that seem to be loosely related to them. You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the old adage that legends like that come from somewhere, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure that&amp;rsquo;s true, but as you all know, I do try to take things with a grain of salt. You have to, out here. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of like working in a hospital, I&amp;rsquo;d imagine. You could spend all day thinking about how many people have died there, and how there are probably ghosts, or whatever you want to call them, all over the place, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do you any good. It just makes it harder to do your job. I think a lot of us feel that way, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we try to just go about our work like everything is fine. Once you get paranoid, there&amp;rsquo;s not really any going back, and a lot of cadets quit because of it. My park especially seems to have a high turn-over rate because the cadets graduate and get so freaked out about everything, and they can&amp;rsquo;t seem to let it go. You have to learn to internalize things and shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to K.D a bit about her experience, because I wanted to know what she thought about the Wendigo. She didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anything in particular to say about it, aside from that she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to think about it that much. She did tell me that a friend of hers has had something similar happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted this person, H, over Skype, and they agreed to talk to me a bit. They&amp;rsquo;re aware of my work here, and they&amp;rsquo;re fine with me posting the story exactly as they wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I grew up in Central Oregon, and there&amp;rsquo;s a reservation called Warm Springs about two or so hours from where I lived. I only mention that because a lot of people in my area have friends there, and a lot of the land in that area belongs to that tribe. When I was a kid, we used to go camping up there. Not on the res, of course, but in that area, and I met a lot of kids who grew up there. I got to know one kid really well; his name was Nolan, and we ended up hanging out a lot when our families were in the area. Our folks got to know each other so we&amp;rsquo;d all get in touch and camp out around the same time. We&amp;rsquo;d camp for about two weeks, so we were out there for a long time.&amp;rdquo; At this point, I asked him if he camped in an RV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, my dad had one, so I guess it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really camping, but we&amp;rsquo;d take our tents and stuff and set them up out away from camp most nights. I didn’t like sleeping in there because I like being outside.&amp;rdquo; We talked for a bit about camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So anyway, sorry, one year Nolan and I were out there, I think we must have been like twelve or so. We wanted to go out and camp near the river because we wanted to try night fishing; I think we must have been about a third of a mile from the main camp. Far enough away that we couldn’t hear or see anyone else, I remember that. We were messing around most of the day. I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember much about it, but we ended up building a fire at some point. I was really impressed because he had this flint or something that he used to start it. I’d never seen anyone do that before, so I thought it was pretty cool. I got him to teach me how to do it and we lit some stuff on fire, which looking back, was really stupid, because it was the middle of fucking summer, and if I remember right, the fire warning was either at yellow or orange. But thankfully, we didn&amp;rsquo;t start anything major, and when it got dark, we sat around and talked about whatever it is twelve-year-olds talk about, I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do remember is that at some point, he looked over my shoulder at the river and asked me if I could see something. The way our camp was set up, we were about ten feet from the river, and we were at the widest point, so it was probably about twenty feet to the other bank. It gets hot up there in the summer, but the water’s still cold, which is important. I look over my shoulder and I could see something wading into the river on the other side. From where we were, it looked like a deer, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell because of the fire. I got up to look closer and I saw a pair of antlers, so I figured it was a buck. But I thought it was weird that it was wading into the water, and it was definitely heading for us, so I asked Nolan what he thought we should do. He&amp;rsquo;s looking at the fire with this weird expression and he tells me to sit down and shut up, so I do, because I&amp;rsquo;d never seen him act that way before. He’s whispering at me to ignore it, and to just keep talking like we were but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything to say. He was saying something about an episode of some show, but I could hear the deer coming through the water, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really paying any attention. I kept trying to see over his shoulder, but every time I did, he&amp;rsquo;d sort of hit me on the arm and make me look at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really scared. I remember I was just sort of confused. But then I heard the deer come out of the water, and I could kind of make out what it looked like, and I realized it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a deer, because whatever it was, it was walking on two legs. I started to get up. I was super freaked out, but Nolan just yanked me back down and talked louder about this television show, and I could tell he was just as scared as I was, probably even more. He leaned in and poked the fire with a stick, and he whispered that whatever I do, I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to it. I could see it come closer, and it stood right behind Nolan&amp;rsquo;s back. I was about ready to pee my pants, and I think I&amp;rsquo;d probably have run if I&amp;rsquo;d been alone, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave Nolan, so I kept sitting really still and sneaking glances at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that tall, but the way it carried itself was just wrong, like its center of balance was screwed up. I can&amp;rsquo;t really describe it, but it was kind of like it kept shifting too far forward. It just stood there behind Nolan for a long time, and eventually Nolan ran out of things to say and we just kind of sat there for a second. The fire was making noise, but I thought I could hear this thing talking in a really low voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear what it was saying, and I leaned forward a tiny little bit, and I actually DID pee my pants when it leaned forward too. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see its face, but I saw its eyes. They were cloudy and milky, and if you want to know what they looked like, find that scene from Lord of the Rings where Frodo falls in the lake and all the dead people are floating toward him. That&amp;rsquo;s what its eyes looked like. So all I saw were these two white eyes floating above Nolan’s head, and the really vague shape of the antlers coming out of its head. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what my face looked like but at exactly the same time, Nolan and I fucking booked it out of there, and we ran nonstop until we got back to the main camp. My pants were soaked with pee, so I took them off as we were running and threw them in the bushes. We both stopped once we were in front of my dad&amp;rsquo;s RV and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything chasing us, so we stood there and caught our breath. I asked him what that thing was but he said he didn&amp;rsquo;t know. He said his grandpa had only warned him that if anything ever came up to him when he was out in the desert, he was never, ever supposed to talk to it or listen to anything it had to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know if he&amp;rsquo;d heard it talking too, and he said that the only thing he&amp;rsquo;d been able to understand was ‘help you’. I think we ended up sleeping in the RV with my parents, and the next night we went back out and didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything. That does remind me, in a lot of ways, of the Wendigo legend. There&amp;rsquo;s a phrase used to describe it that I think fits perfectly, which is that the Wendigo is &amp;rsquo;the spirit of the lonely places.&amp;rsquo; I know sometimes, when I&amp;rsquo;m out in the wilds, where I know there&amp;rsquo;s no one around me for miles and miles, I get this weird kind of craving that I can&amp;rsquo;t really explain. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it happens to anyone else, but it&amp;rsquo;s this desire to consume. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I crave anything in particular, but more of this weird, distracting hunger that comes from every part of my gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to find out more about the faceless man, if I was able, and found a few similar things. I asked around my circle of friends, and one of them said when he was out doing repairs at a park in his area, he saw something kind of like that. We were having dinner in town, five of us including myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy, he was repainting an information booth and heard a man ask him for directions to the nearest campsite. He didn&amp;rsquo;t turn around because he was up on a ladder, but he informed the man that there weren&amp;rsquo;t any campsites nearby, but that if he headed down the road about four miles, he’d find one at another park. He asked if he could be of any other help, but the man said no, and thanked him. My friend said he kept painting, but he was listening, and never heard the man leave. &amp;ldquo;The second he came up and talked to me, the hairs on my neck stood up, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why. I just had this really uneasy feeling about the whole thing, and I wanted to finish painting and get out of there. I figured maybe part of it was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t turn around to look at him, but something just felt off. There was also this weird smell floating around even before the guy talked to me, kind of like old period blood. I had looked around to see what was causing it, but I didn’t find anything. So I waited for the guy to walk away, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear him leave, which made me think he was just standing there and watching me, so I asked again if I could do anything for him, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t answer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I knew he was there, though, because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard him leave, so I did this awkward turn on the ladder to look down and see what he was doing. Now I admit it could have just been my brain fucking up, but I swear to you, Russ, for a split second when I turned around, that fucker didn&amp;rsquo;t have a face. Like, he had &lt;em&gt;no face&lt;/em&gt;. It was almost concave, and totally smooth, and I just about had a fucking heart attack because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even wrap my brain around what I was seeing. I think I started to say something, but there was this kind of &amp;lsquo;pop&amp;rsquo; inside my head and suddenly he was just a normal looking guy. I must have looked weird because he asked me if I was okay, and I was just like &amp;lsquo;yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m fine.&amp;rsquo; He asks about the campsite again and I point to where he has to go, and he&amp;rsquo;s like &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not from around here, can you help me get there?&amp;rsquo; Now this is when I know something is really up, because there&amp;rsquo;s no way this guy got out here and didn&amp;rsquo;t know where he was. And for that matter, there&amp;rsquo;s no car around, so how&amp;rsquo;d he get here in the first place? I said I was sorry, but that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take him anywhere in a company vehicle, and he&amp;rsquo;s like &amp;lsquo;please? I really don’t know where I am, can you come with me and help me get there?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So now I&amp;rsquo;m seriously weirded out, and I start wondering if this is some kind of ambush or whatever. I told him I could call him a taxi to come out and take him where he wants to go, and I pull out my phone and he just goes &amp;rsquo;no&amp;rsquo; and walks away really quickly. But he doesn&amp;rsquo;t walk out of the park, he walks back into the fucking trees and I got right in my fucking truck and start to get out of there, fuck the paint or whatever. I looked in my mirror to see where he was as I was leaving and he was standing right at the tree line again, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he got there so fast, but this time I know that fucker didn&amp;rsquo;t have a face. He was just watching me leave, and right before I turned the corner, he took a big step back into the trees and kind of dissolved, I guess. Maybe it was just so dark he blended in, but it felt more like he just melted away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, right after this guy finished his story, someone else piped up with another one, but with a slightly different twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know, actually, I had something sort of weird like that happen a while back. I was out doing some trail scouting, and I was out in the middle of nowhere figuring out where we were gonna have this trail run through. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen anyone else for probably a good two hours, so I wasn’t really paying attention to where I was going; I was just looking at the ground for the most part. Then out of nowhere, I crested this little hill and almost ran into this guy. He was older, probably in his sixties, and I started to apologize to him for running into him. And then I noticed his face, and I probably looked like a complete douchebag because I stopped and just stared at him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It took me a second to figure out what was wrong, but this guy&amp;rsquo;s face was huge. I know that sounds weird, but that&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can describe it. His head wasn&amp;rsquo;t big or anything, it was normal, but the amount of space his face took up was just way too much. Like if you took someone&amp;rsquo;s face and enlarged it all by about two times. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything, he just kind of looks at me, and I backed up and was kind of stuttering and saying I was sorry, and I went around him and fucking got out of there and did what I needed to do. The whole time, I kept looking behind me because I was so freaked out that he&amp;rsquo;d pop up behind me or something. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I swear to you it was one of the creepiest things I’ve ever seen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched the topic to the stairs a little later, and there was a definite shift in enthusiasm. No one spoke up at first; there&amp;rsquo;s a real stigma around discussing them, even when we&amp;rsquo;re away from work. But I broke the ice with a story of my own, and the guy who told the story about the faceless man told this one, albeit very quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Couple years ago, I was camping with my girlfriend, and we were out about two miles from the road at this site I know. We went to bed that night, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep because-&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone interjected a funny comment, and we were dangerously close to going off on another subject, but I got us back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;-yeah, really funny, you fucker. No, it was because we kept hearing that grinding noise. My brother used to grind his teeth in his sleep, and it kind of reminded me of that. My girlfriend was freaking out but I just kept telling her to ignore it because I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it before and you just have to ignore it. It goes away eventually; you guys know what I mean.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all knew what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So eventually, I got her to go to sleep, but I woke up probably two hours later because something was just off. I rolled over and she wasn&amp;rsquo;t there, and I kind of freaked out, because&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thought for a second and then he took a very long drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anyway, I ran out of the tent calling her name, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go far. She was standing at the edge of the camp looking at something in the trees, and I could see she was really pale. The fire was low, but bright enough to see her. Anyway, so I ran up to see what was going on and she was dead asleep, but her eyes were open. She had this real spaced-out look, y&amp;rsquo;know. So I put my arm around her to lead her back, but she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t move. She just said really quietly something like ‘I have to go now, Eddie. I have to go, it&amp;rsquo;s here.&amp;rsquo; I was like &amp;lsquo;you&amp;rsquo;re just sleepwalking, come back to bed&amp;rsquo; but she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t budge. She just kept standing there and saying that she had to go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And I looked where she was looking, and there was a fucking staircase right there about fifteen yards away. Grey one, concrete. And she started to walk toward it, but I yanked her back and that woke her up. She looked at me like I was fucking out of my mind, and she asked what the fuck she was doing out of the tent. I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell her anything, I just told her she was sleepwalking. The grinding was gone, so she just went back to the tent with me and fell asleep again. I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t like thinking about it, y&amp;rsquo;know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You guys remember that kid with&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t remember what it was, some kind of brain fuck-up, not Down&amp;rsquo;s but something like it. Well I got to read the report he gave when they found him a week after he went missing, and it was fucked up beyond belief. I mean, you have to take it with a grain of salt because who knows what that kid actually thinks is real, but some of this stuff, I don&amp;rsquo;t think he could have made up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well first of all, he talked about the stairs. He said he&amp;rsquo;d been watching his dad build a fire and the stairs &amp;lsquo;came up to him&amp;rsquo;, and he had to go up them or something bad would happen. The cops couldn’t really understand what he was talking about after that, because he just kept saying &amp;rsquo;like the campfire&amp;rsquo; over and over. And he kept mentioning sounds, but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t say what sounds, just that it was loud and he covered his ears so he couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear them. But the thing I remember most is that they asked him where exactly he&amp;rsquo;d gone, and he just said he was right there. He kept pointing at himself, and they said they thought that meant that he thought he&amp;rsquo;d never left. He said he wasn&amp;rsquo;t scared because the stairs were there, and he said they talked to him, but not like people talk. Like I said, it was really convoluted and hard to understand, and I have a feeling the cops didn&amp;rsquo;t take most of it down. They ended up just saying that the kid had some kind of amnesia or fugue, and that they didn&amp;rsquo;t think foul play was involved. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really explain why he came back a week later perfectly fine without a speck of dirt on him and well fed, but hey, what the cops say goes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still a lot of questions I want to answer. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to ask around and find out whatever I can. The next update should be soon; thanks for being so patient.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Chapter 7: Zenith</title>
		<link>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 01:47:34 -0600</pubDate>
		
		<guid>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/</guid>
		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we are, at the final world. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to discuss this part, and it
still bothers me very much, but it&amp;rsquo;s something I have to do, so that I can put
this behind me. People deserve to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was well aware of the game&amp;rsquo;s unnatural nature, but Zenith was
different than the other worlds. While the others were certainly strange, and
sometimes frightening, the world of Zenith was like a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go any further than the board screen for an indication that
something was wrong with Zenith. The first thing I noticed was the blood red
texture of the board, and the music, which was an eerie whistling tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image:  is currently unavailable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noticed that I had Solomon and Anguirus back, and I felt better for a second.
Then I scrolled over to the right to see who my enemies would be this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image:  is currently unavailable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time it was Destoroyah and Ghidorah. But judging from the icon it was a
different Ghidorah than the original, standing on the ground instead of flying.
The grotesquely detailed pinkish red icon also caught my eye. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell
what it was supposed to be, and I was afraid to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to my side of the board, I decided there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much choice but to do
my usual &amp;ldquo;routine&amp;rdquo;, in going to the Quiz level before doing anything else. I was
not ready for what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I jumped back when this appeared, accompanied by a terribly distorted version of
the password theme. It looked as if Face had fallen victim to some terrible
glitch. Is this what he meant by &amp;ldquo;Will you miss me?&amp;rdquo; Did he know this would
happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thoughts were stopped short as I noticed the screen was glitching and
seemingly falling apart while I was inactive, and so I quickly rushed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image:  is currently unavailable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when I got back to the board, I had somehow gained a new monster. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t
even been asked if I wanted one. I tried to select it, and this happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s behavior was scaring me, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even started the levels yet. I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why I was randomly given a new character, and then denied
use of it. But for the time being there was little that could be done, and I
viewed the last TV Screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;No animation. No music. Dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every instinct I had was telling me to stop playing, to just turn the game off.
And something in the game itself might have been trying to warn me as to just
how horrible this last world was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, every stretch of the way I was compelled to give up. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do
that now, on the last world! Besides, after taunting me with memories of
Melissa, I felt the game owed me some answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the first level was a Red Temple, so at least I would be familiar
with the level graphics if nothing else. And I went in with Godzilla, the
monster I was most familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Godzilla had been shrunk, the level and score meters had vanished, and the Blue
Temple statue faces were back. The music was similar to the Blue Temple also:
Strange, haunting vocalizations. I tried to get my spirits up by thinking &amp;ldquo;Well,
If this level is like the Blue Temple, then that might mean there are no enemies
to deal with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short walk, all the statue&amp;rsquo;s eyes starting glowing, and a pack of the
beasts from Shadow Labyrinth came charging into me. Since they were coming from
the right of the screen, I had to fight my way through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Redtemple2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This battle greatly tested my reflexes, but thanks to my speed I plowed through
the beasts. They gave off health power-ups after dying, which helped recover the
damage they had given me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I continued through the hallway, the statue&amp;rsquo;s eyes glowed again,
summoning another wave. It seemed to be the same number of them, but I was less
prepared this time, and took more damage. I had gone through four of these waves
until I reached the end of the hall, where I heat beamed the last of the
monsters over the edge into an abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first it seemed I had reached a dead end, but after the statue&amp;rsquo;s eyes stopped
glowing, a brick path slowly appeared before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the path, which kept me moving towards the right until it stopped at
a wall, where I was to go vertically by jumping up ledges. Along the way I
encountered new creatures, and some sort of strange shrine, which had a statue
of the Hell beast and some other creature I don&amp;rsquo;t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I went through, the path took a downward direction. I had to carefully aim my
jumps to avoid the enemies, which were plentiful in this part of the stage. They
didn&amp;rsquo;t have many attacks, but they could easily shove you over the edge off a
platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of this tunnel, there were a few small platforms floating above
nothingness. I landed on one towards the left of the screen, and then something
came down from above. It looked like the Blue Angel from the Graveyard, except
now it was red and had a skull face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Redtemple8.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any of the pleasant feelings I had from the Blue Angel were not present with
this Red one, and as it hovered around, its eye sockets started glowing just
like the statues, summoning monsters to attack me. Surely this was not the same
benevolent being I encountered before, this must be some kind of impostor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle was nerve-wracking, as I started off with nearly half my health and
had to deal with multiple opponents, as well as the threat of gravity. To make
things even worse, as the Red Angel took damage some of the panels fell, until
only 3 remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my luck had not ran out yet, just when I thought it was over, I struck the
Red Angel one more time, and it turned out that one last hit was all it could
take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the Red Angel completely disintegrated, the game instantly went back to
the Zenith board. I moved Mothra over to the nearest stage from the Red Temple,
which seemed be a garbled mess of letters spelling KILL, and began playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Glitchland1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As suspected, all the level graphics were made of jumbled letters. And Mothra,
just like Godzilla, was shrunk to half size. I began to suspect that all the
Zenith levels would be like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background music was terrible, like if someone put all the sounds an NES was
capable of making into a blender and then piecing them back together into a
&amp;ldquo;song&amp;rdquo;. I had to turn the volume down because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Glitchland2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing as Mothra made avoiding the enemies easier, but they were nonetheless
determined to get at me. The first enemies I saw were headless Gigans, and later
on there were hybrids monsters pieced together from previous bosses, like the
Biollante headed thing seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes had gone by as I didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything new, and the level shifted
into another segment. The music changed from the loud and annoying beeps into
something far more ambient and menacing. The level graphics also changed, now
looking a blood drenched junkyard. The way everything in this level was red made
it sickening to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enemies multiplied in number, never ceasing to follow after me, and became
harder and harder to avoid. And at the end of the level, the situation reached a
climax, as the swarms of monsters fused together in one enormous, terrifying
hybrid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Glitchland5.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I had gotten through the initial shock, I discovered the way to destroy
this thing: constantly shooting eye beams at the Hedorah cluster that formed its
&amp;ldquo;heads&amp;rdquo;. If you attacked anywhere else, it would regenerate the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Glitchland6.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with that knowledge, this was an extremely difficult fight. I&amp;rsquo;d say it was
as hard as fighting the Moon Beast was, if not harder. Its most common attack
was lunging forward with its arms, covered with Gigan saws and blades, if they
touched it would instantly drain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was over, the remaining monsters collapsed into a heap. Then they, and
the ground below them, started to disintegrate and sink towards the bottom of
the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I came back to the board, I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;So far, the game has been
putting the easiest levels first&amp;hellip; if that&amp;rsquo;s the case, how bad will the rest of
Zenith be?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two levels down and three to go, my monsters and I had taken our foothold
in the world of nightmares that was Zenith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding what action to take next was more tense and difficult than ever before.
But ultimately, I had no way of knowing what the next levels would be like, or
how well my monsters would be prepared for them, so my only option was to guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to to interpret what the icons of the next levels ahead of me were. The
last level before the boss battles was obviously representing some type of
volcanic area, with lava and open flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle icon I still didn&amp;rsquo;t get, except that it looked &amp;ldquo;fleshy&amp;rdquo;, and vaguely
like an organ of some kind. Oddly oversized as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one I was nearest to, and about to enter next, looked like thorny vines
covering a puddle of blood. I guessed this would be a level with blood &amp;ldquo;rivers&amp;rdquo;,
like the chase level of Dementia. As such, I went with Anguirus, because due to
his rolling move he would have the fastest speed while submerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level which I call &amp;ldquo;Blood Lake&amp;rdquo; looked like I expected. Rivers of blood
accompanied by thorn covered vines, which were scattered along the sides of the
ground. The music was rather faint, but I could hear a distinct drum beat, and a
few other instruments. a lot of echoes, and sometimes it sounded like someone
was hitting a drum underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Bloodlake1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed to see that Anguirus was shrunk just as Godzilla and Mothra
had been, apparently all the Zenith levels would be like this. I felt less
secure with my giant monsters no longer so giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked along without interruption for only a minute until my path reached a
dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Bloodlake2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a massive gap between the ground I was walking on and the ground to
the right of the screen. I would have swam across it and continued walking to
the right, but due to the huge mass of brambles in the way, there was nowhere to
go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two creatures with gliding membranes on their arms, and lamprey like mouths were
perched on outstretched vines and screeching at me, much like a crow does to an
invader of its territory. Another unnerving display of possible sentience by the
creatures of this game. If it&amp;rsquo;s even accurate to refer to them as being &amp;ldquo;of the
game&amp;rdquo;, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I descended into the blood, slowly sinking to the floor. Aquatic enemies were
everywhere, and they were hard to avoid. The black shark in particular was very
aggressive and hard to deal with, but thankfully I only encountered one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scene become more and more crowded, I swam up to the surface, to find
that it was littered with floating corpses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creepy, but at least they&amp;rsquo;re not a threat.&amp;rdquo; Or so I thought&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Until they all sprang to life and leaped on me! They were trying to pull me
under, and they were draining my health as they did it. They all attacked as a
group, and when I got one off me, another would jump on me from behind. I had to
curl up into a ball and roll for them to loosen their grip, and when they did I
quickly retreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I had reached another land path. A note regarding the brambles,
you can stand on them but it causes pain, and you can also destroy some of the vines,
but only the thinner ones. I had to destroy multiple vines, as well as dealing with
more enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen was only up for about thirty seconds, then when it went back to the
level, I was facing another dead end, and a pregnant humanoid creature being
hanged from the top right of the screen, by a spine/umbilical cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instantly, the creature&amp;rsquo;s belly was split open from the inside!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as the lower part of its body was ripped apart and fell into the river
below, the Blood Lakes boss was revealed;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came flying towards me, making a shrill, hacking scream. I was forced to move
back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Bobofight2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bat was a highly mobile boss, fast and difficult to hit. As I moved back
along the ground , the monster opened its mouth and shout out a barrage of
needles. I jumped over them and managed to give it a blow to the head, and it
started flying out of my reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Bobofight3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the bat was flying, it shot a stream of fire from its eye sockets, and
started trying to hit me with the flames. I rolled along the ground, which
drained my power, but put us at equal speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now, only two levels left to go. Who to send this time?&amp;rdquo; Godzilla, Mothra, and
Anguirus had all completed one level, leaving Solomon. And also, the mysterious
fifth monster. I tried again to access it, but with no luck. I chose to use
Godzilla again for the next level, and Solomon for the final one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second to last level was what I refer to as the &amp;ldquo;Organic Level&amp;rdquo;, which was
the most visually unpleasant of them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Organiclevel1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right from the start I could see that the graphics where freakishly different.
The atmosphere was gruesome and foreboding, with the addition of the loud,
droning music. I was dreading what I would see in these levels, and it was only
a few seconds before something appeared:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Organiclevel2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hideous&amp;hellip; things. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to describe most of this level. Everything had
this disturbing &amp;ldquo;semi-real&amp;rdquo; look to it. Most of the enemies look halfway between
real animals, and misshapen lumps of gore with teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also worth noting that all of them were considerably larger than Godzilla,
and although the majority were not very intelligent, each of them took around
30+ hits to kill. Due to this, it was a better idea to run away from them than
fight, but it was never clear exactly what direction to run to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most levels involved going to the right to get to the exit, the path of
this level was primarily going down, by walking to the edge of one platform and
jumping down to a lower one. There was no way to make sure you were going the
right way, nor any apparent means of getting back up to the higher platforms if
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, certain enemies acted as if they were aware you had to jump down, and
would stand at the edge of a lower platform, waiting for you. When this
happened, I would have to walk back and wait until the monster would leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Organiclevel3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I went on I came across platforms stacked above each other with little space
in between, looking like a maze. This meant that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t jump, and it made
escape from enemies difficult. Thankfully, the only enemies able to fit through
these mazes were the four-legged beasts seen at the beginning of the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the difficulty were long, tapeworm-esque monsters, that would rise
themselves up between the platforms and trap you. The only attack they responded
to was the heat beam, which would cause them to shrink back down. But this was
costing even more power, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to do without the heat beam for
long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While trying to avoid the abominations that dwell in this level, I found out
that if you stand idle in one place for too long, the ground tries to absorb
your monster;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Organiclevel5.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it was about four minutes before the end that this level was making me
physically sick. The tension was getting to me, and having to take in all these
disgusting sights made me want to puke. I nearly did pause the game and look for
a bag, but I was able to hold it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found a trick at the end of the level, though it was too late to do me
any real good. If two different species of monster to run into each other
face-to-face, they would fight each other and leave me alone. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
intentionally cause this, it just happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally at the end, it was time for another boss fight. It was certainly ugly,
but not quite as horrific as I feared it would be. But more important than
dealing with its appearance was defeating it, and since I had less than half my
health bar to start with, there was no room for errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Canidontrevealed.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was attached to the floor when I first saw it, but after ten hits it detached
from the floor and began floating. It moved fast, and unlike the Blood Lakes
boss he wasn&amp;rsquo;t impeded by any sort of gravity. It was even able to fly through
the ground without any collision effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It used this to its advantage, and would float beneath the ground and spring up
randomly to bite at you. But it stopped doing this after a few well aimed kicks
to the face. The pink area on its upper jaw was a weak point, too many hits
there would cause it to spasm uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Canidontfight2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new strategy was to rapidly float up down while moving back and forth across
the stage, trying to constantly keep its jaws aimed towards me. Health was
getting critical at this point, and I spammed the heat beam, from which it had
no defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last stretch of the battle, the monster had lost its mind, rapidly
rushing back and forth and gnashing its jaws. I had to duck under it, and then
strike when its back was turned. Twenty more hits, and it was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One last level to go&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it was down to one last level. I didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate, I selected Solomon
and entered. Perhaps a little too fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Inferno1z.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last level was definitely the peak of disconnect between what the NES was
graphically capable of, and what this game could create. The music also caught
my attention, it was one of the only songs that appeared more than once&amp;mdash;the
horrible screeching from when the Hellbeast appeared in the graveyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon I started, there was already an enemy prepared to attack, a centaur
wielding a whip. And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started fighting, several more centaurs appeared. Coming from both sides
at the screen at the same time, it was too much to handle. Solomon&amp;rsquo;s flight
saved me from taking too much damage at the start of the level. The centaurs
followed after, but seemed to be unable to jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Inferno2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After escaping the centaurs I noticed gaps in the ground. While trying to avoid
the jumping sword mouthed enemies in mid-flight I got close to the surface of
the lava, and a creature emerged and tried to grab me. It didn&amp;rsquo;t succeed, but I
was startled. Careful maneuvering would be needed to avoid instant death here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new enemies appeared,the level soon became very difficult. A lot of the
trouble came from stocky red demons that stood on top of tall, narrow mountains
and spewed fire. I got by them by waiting till their back was turned, and
hitting them with a flying kick, which made them fall into the lava. It was at
this time I noticed that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t gaining any health from killing enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all the ground was stable. At one point, the ground was reduced to small
chunks that slowly drifted towards the right. Some of them would sink into the
lava upon landing on them, and there was no way to tell which ones would sink
and which would not. Being so close to the lava added the threat of the lava
creatures, and this was very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also feeling very hot, which made concentrating hard. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had a
heat rash, it felt similar to that. I had periodically stop for water because of
it. This was almost certainly due to the game, and not my imagination, but I
kept pushing the thought out of my head. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the stage, I encountered the boss rising from the lava, its
arrival noted with a ungodly howling roar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it walked onto the land, I saw how gigantic it was, several times the size
of Solomon. I was about to fly up and attack it, when it opened its mouth and
let out a huge blast of fire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to fly to dodge the flames, and then get close enough to the boss to fire
a heat beam at its face, causing it to stumble backward. If it didn&amp;rsquo;t stumble
backwards, it would have kept moving left until it forced Solomon into the lava,
as there was no more ground within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beast had to wait between uses of its fire breath, as it seemed to cost a
great deal of energy. I used this time to attack it. But fire wasn&amp;rsquo;t its only
weapon, and I had to wary of the monster swatting at me with its clawed hands.
As its health decreased, it moved faster,and the battle felt like a tug of war
between the two monsters over this bridge of land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about forty hits, it was defeated, tumbling backwards into the lava from
whence it came. And then, the final stage had been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last it was down to two bosses, and a final encounter with the Hellbeast. For
some reason I thought Ghidorah would be easier to beat, so I confronted him
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic &amp;ldquo;Ghidorah Battle&amp;rdquo; music from the original started up as I was faced
against the new King Ghidorah;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Ghidorah was as powerful and unrelenting as ever. He instantly lashed out
with Gravity Beams, which were more damaging than Godzilla&amp;rsquo;s heat beam. It
became a struggle of constantly beating Ghidorah at every oppoortunity to keep
him from using the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ghidorah soon saw through my tactic and started using physical attacks as
well. He would strike with each of his necks, knocking me backward and making it
impossible to get close enough to punch him. But I had an idea, to wait for him
to lunge with one of his heads, and immediately blast it with the heat beam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked, and to my surprise the heat beam had actually obliterated Ghidorah&amp;rsquo;s
middle head. It was only a few seconds before I realized what this would lead
to, and sure enough&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;King Ghidorah was using the power of the glitch to transform into Mecha King
Ghidorah. But what really shocked me was the sudden change of music. I had heard
it before, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t from the original NES game&amp;mdash;It was from the game Super
Godzilla, during the Mecha King Ghidorah fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mecha King Ghidorah&amp;rsquo;s first attack was its most deadly: The Machine Hand. Very
similar to Gigan&amp;rsquo;s Saw, it immobilizes the monster and rapidly drains the health
bar. Fortunately, before Ghidorah could do a lot of damage, the timer ran out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Mechakingghidorah2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would need to defeat Mecha King Ghidorah quickly to prevent him from using the
Machine Hand, so I sent Solomon to fight him. The two monsters were evenly
matched in strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Solomon was faster, and by slashing and heat beaming without pause, the
cyborg monster soon met its end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ghidorah defeated, I was returned to the board. I now outnumbered the enemy
by four monsters to one, and victory seemed to be soon at hand. The Base Icon
had changed to a blood red color. I could feel hatred emanating from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started the fight against Destoroyah with Anguirus, and the music was the same
as Ghidorah&amp;rsquo;s. When the fight began, Destoroyah was in Microscopic form. After
one hit it changed into the Juvenile, which had few attacks and was also dealt
with easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight became serious once Destoroyah entered the Aggregate Form, gaining the
use of large arms and the micro-oxygen beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Destoroyah3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anguirus&amp;rsquo; roll attack, which had been very useful up until now, was rendered
useless by Destoroyah constantly attacking me with his large arms when I tried
to use it. For this part of the fight I had to rely on brute strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the time ran out, Destoroyah had changed into his Flying form, which
Anguirus was ill-suited to fight against. Going back in,I fought against the
flying form with Mothra (which seemed fitting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Destoroyah4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mothra was weaker than Anguirus, but was much better equipped to dodge and counter
Flying Destoroyah&amp;rsquo;s attacks, so the fight was in my favor. However, the Mecha
Ghidorah fight music started playing and Destoroyah changed into his Final form
sooner than expected, which drastically turned the tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-7-zenith/Destoroyah5-1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mothra&amp;rsquo;s attacks were doing very little to Destoroyah, and I had to move
furiously to avoid damage while waiting for the timer to run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it would be near impossible to beat Destoroyah with Mothra, I still
had three other monsters. Final form Destoroyah was very resistant to taking
damage, and the heavily armored foe would not be defeated without a long fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last part of the fight I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using much strategy, just attacking as
brutally and as fast as I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its last bar of health Destoroyah tried one last counter-attack&amp;mdash;a beam of
energy from its chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how powerful it would have been, because just before it could fire
I punched Destoroyah in the chest cavity, destroying him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then that was it&amp;mdash;the last kaiju boss was gone. In the midst of all the
excitement, I had briefly forgotten that there was still one last thing to do
before the game would be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the icon again hit me like a ton of bricks, and I froze for a few minutes.
I had come so far to get to this point. But I was terrified. I really did not
want to know what this last encounter was going to be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could let myself think about it any longer, I moved Godzilla over and
began the stage. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re here now. This is the end. Just one last thing, and
then it&amp;rsquo;s all over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the screen changed, there was&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just Godzilla and a black screen. I walked back and forth. Fired a heat beam.
Nothing happened, until I heard something&amp;mdash;the faint sound of a familiar drum
beat.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about an hour since my last post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;rsquo;t had any customers yet, and if the gas station weren&amp;rsquo;t an active crime scene I might have asked one of the other employees to squeegee the large pool of blood into the drains by the cooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you out of the loop, you may want to catch up by reading my earlier posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what Arnold&amp;rsquo;s personal grooming routine looks like, and I have to assume he spends at least twenty minutes a day in moustache prep, but even factoring that in he should have made it to the gas station by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called him a few minutes ago to make sure he hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone back to bed, and to make sure I hadn&amp;rsquo;t imagined the phone call in the first place. The conversation went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, Arnold? You on your way?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sit tight, we had a little emergency.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ok.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The road between town and you is blocked off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ok&amp;hellip; Which one?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All of them. Even the service roads. It must have been a freak storm. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. All the roads are covered in trees. But they aren&amp;rsquo;t, you know, fallen. The trees are growing in the middle of the street. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find a way around all morning, but I&amp;rsquo;ve given up. I&amp;rsquo;m about to head through on foot. Just to be clear, you said you heard from Spencer Middleton last night? Has he made any other contact?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, actually, he&amp;rsquo;s here. He came in and some stuff happened and now he&amp;rsquo;s dead.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What!? You&amp;rsquo;re telling me there&amp;rsquo;s a dead body at the gas station?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already told him all of this. Man, I really miss Tom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you not realize that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry,&amp;rdquo; he answered, &amp;ldquo;When the phone rang earlier I had just woken up from this beautiful weird dream of a&amp;hellip; dark god&amp;hellip; calling me into his eternal grace, taking me by the hand and guiding me into blessed oblivion, freeing me from all the pain and suffering of this mortal prison. Nurturing me like a child and inviting the world into a realm of higher existence, allowing me the privilege to devote myself to his glorious servitude.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ok,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll see you when you get here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended the call and checked the charge on the phone. The battery was sitting close to fifty percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the deal, Lucille?&amp;rdquo; asked Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Arnold is on his way here on foot. But we might have another problem.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Holy shit, you guys see that?&amp;rdquo; Diego asked, pointing out the window. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite make it out from where I was seated behind the counter, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like hobbling over a corpse just for a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is it?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of naked people out on the road walking this way.&amp;rdquo; Diego answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The hell you say?&amp;rdquo; said Marlboro, who had suddenly taken interest. He pressed his face against the window for a better look. &amp;ldquo;Those aren&amp;rsquo;t just any people. I know them. That&amp;rsquo;s Marla! and Tyler! And there goes Fred! At least, those were the names I gave them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin crossed to the frozen drink machine, throwing over his shoulder a quick &amp;ldquo;They friends of yours?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Family, actually. Well, they were anyway, before they disappeared. But I don&amp;rsquo;t remember them looking like that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like what?&amp;rdquo; I asked, starting to get an uneasy feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; He took a second to find the words, but all he came up with was &amp;ldquo;They look funny.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They continued walking closer to the gas station. Close enough by now that I could see them. At least a dozen people, stark naked. The closer they got, the more details I could make out, the more I wish I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Their eyes were milky and pale, maggots crawling out of infested crevices all over their bodies. Their skin dirty and covered in lesions and bruises. Marlboro was certainly not wrong, they looked funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you know the Hollywood-style Zombie walk. The shuffle of an undead body with impaired motor skills. The scariest part of these &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; approaching the front doors of the gas station was that they were walking one hundred percent perfectly normally. Just a bunch of decaying nudists out for a stroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a loud crash that snapped us out of our probably-rude staring. We all turned to see that Benjamin had pulled the frozen drink machine to the ground, and was attempting to drag it over Spencer towards the front doors, the sticky syrup concoction spilled out all over the ground, mixing with the congealed blood and coating the floor in a red and brown and purple viscous soup. There&amp;rsquo;s no way we won&amp;rsquo;t have an insect problem after this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro and Diego didn&amp;rsquo;t have to ask what was going on. They instantly knew the plan and began yanking down whatever fixtures weren&amp;rsquo;t bolted in place and piling them up in a barricade against the glass doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have helped if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for this broken leg. Besides, it looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve got this under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You boys think you can stay alive long enough for help to arrive?&amp;rdquo; Benjamin asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve got almost ninety years experience staying alive between the three of us,&amp;rdquo; Diego joked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin directed his next question to me. &amp;ldquo;You got any weapons in this place?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him no. The only thing I have is a half-empty canister of gasoline in the supply closet and some really hard jerky, but he was welcome to whatever he could find. That&amp;rsquo;s when he started Macgyvering some spears out of chair legs and broken glass from the drink case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About ten minutes ago, the gas station lost power. Now really would be a great time to have a giant pet glow-in-the-dark butterfly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid racoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been pretty quiet, save for the wet guttural whispering coming from those &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; outside. Benjamin is still searching for weapons while Diego finds things to push against the front door, and (assuming he hasn&amp;rsquo;t fallen asleep) Marlboro has taken the back door. I was feeling pretty useless after Benjamin confiscated my crutches, so I figured I would take this opportunity to type up the account of what happened, just in case Arnold gets here too late. And in the spirit of preparedness, I should say a few things to whoever finds this message (or is it &amp;ldquo;whomever&amp;rdquo;? I never could get that right.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, to the owners, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry about the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, to her, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry we didn&amp;rsquo;t run into each other one last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, to whomever keeps dumping tar into the ditch outside of the gas station, I hate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s all I have to say. It&amp;rsquo;s been a weird, crazy ride. This is Jack from the gas station, signing off one last time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t die!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry it&amp;rsquo;s been so long since the last update, I just got my laptop back from the police. (Special thanks to whoever gilded me, by the way. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with reddit gold, but it brings warmth to my soul.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you guys are probably wondering what happened. Well, last week I met a dark god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were in that gas station without power for hours. It&amp;rsquo;s cold this time of year, so we huddled together around a plate of scented candles and ate pork rinds and canned beans. Marlboro almost dozed off a couple times before Diego decided to loot the energy pills behind the counter. He handed them out and we all took a few, washing them down with cold coffee and telling ourselves it was for &amp;ldquo;alertness,&amp;rdquo; but all they did for me was create a heartbeat arrhythmia. That sure would be funny, if those things finally broke in here just to find the four of us dead from heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not &amp;ldquo;funny.&amp;rdquo; But, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego tried to strike up a conversation with Benjamin a couple of times, but the bearded man wasn&amp;rsquo;t very social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You Army?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I knew a guy. He was a ranger in the Army. You remind me of him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Those things out there, any idea what we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with? You ever see anything like that before?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You got any family?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked Spencer&amp;rsquo;s phone throughout the day, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting any service anymore. I tried 911 a few times, but even that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go through. When the battery got to five percent, I turned it off. We might need it later for an emergency call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the adrenaline and pills started to wear off and I remembered that my leg was still healing from a complex fracture and maybe I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have agreed to come back to work so soon. I did the cripple-walk back to the front desk to grab my meds. While I was there, I spotted the still-unopened gift-wrapped package on the shelf beneath the register. I decided to ignore it and instead grabbed the employee whiskey bottle that was behind it. We told ourselves it was for our &amp;ldquo;nerves&amp;rdquo; but all it did for me was give me an even worse heartbeat arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more hours passed. After we killed the first bottle we opened another, then Marlboro got into the energy drinks because we needed mixers. At some point the former cultist pulled out his stash and lit a joint and (without asking, I might add) turned the whole station into a hotbox. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember if I&amp;rsquo;d taken my pain meds yet, so I went ahead and took them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun started to set, I had two thoughts competing for first place in my mind. First, it sure is getting dark early these days. And second, I think we might be getting a little too fucked up to handle what&amp;rsquo;s about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time became even more illusory than normal once the laptop died and we had no way of knowing how long we&amp;rsquo;d been waiting. We started measuring the time in candles. Our snack food and morale raced each other to depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, Diego got me away from the others to ask what I thought about Benjamin. I told him he was the nicest guy that had pointed a gun in my face all week. But Diego told me that he had a weird feeling about him. I reminded Diego that he had killed Kieffer a couple times and maybe he should get off his high horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; Benjamin yelled at us from across the room. &amp;ldquo;What are you two talking about?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anime.&amp;rdquo; I lied. I think he bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Get back over here. I don&amp;rsquo;t need any more dead bodies piling up tonight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin was in the corner, warming his hands over the candle plate. It was the only source of light in the building, and was casting shadows that could maybe be described as &amp;ldquo;spooky&amp;rdquo; if I weren&amp;rsquo;t in such a serious life-or-death situation. Some of those shadows looked like faces, smiling, laughing at us idiots. One or two looked like old presidents. One of them asked me what time it was and holy crap I was tripping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You ok, man?&amp;rdquo; Diego asked, snapping me back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I honestly have no idea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you ever figure out who placed that bomb?&amp;rdquo; asked Spencer Middleton in a gurgle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean? I thought you did it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not me. Bombs aren&amp;rsquo;t my style. Who do you know that can build a bomb?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, where&amp;rsquo;s Marlboro?!&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin picked up his spear – formerly my crutch that he had paracorded his knife to – and asked, &amp;ldquo;Who the hell is ‘Marlboro?&amp;rsquo; Is there someone else here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marlboro. The other employee.&amp;rdquo; I looked at Diego, who just shrugged and said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know no Marlboro. How many of them pills did you take?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had I imagined Marlboro this entire time? Did I just Tyler Durden this guy into existence? I tried to sit down on the tarp, but it turned into me lying on my back while the room spun. I could feel the human debris squish beneath the tarp fabric as I rested my head. How much of any of this was real anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re losing it, you know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those years ago, the first doctor tried to prepare me for life with my condition. There weren&amp;rsquo;t that many other cases before me, so they didn&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how everything would play out. But every case had a few of the same side effects. Of course there would be weight loss, fatigue, headaches, all of the signs of a normal physical illness early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the condition developed, there would be more &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; side effects. Hallucinations, memory loss, the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t be properly anesthetized. They tried in other cases to induce medical comas, but that just messed things up further. I&amp;rsquo;m always wide awake and halfway lucid during surgery. If you want to know what that&amp;rsquo;s like, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you the truth. It&amp;rsquo;s boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know what? Usually when I hurt someone bad enough, they pass out from the pain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They gave me a couple years, tops. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping track of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then, Marlboro walked into the room, zipping up his fly. Presumably, he had just come from the bathroom, but who really knows? I pointed at him and yelled, &amp;ldquo;That guy! You see him, right?! It&amp;rsquo;s Marlboro!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego looked where I was pointing, then back at me. &amp;ldquo;What, you mean Jerry?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. That&amp;rsquo;s right. He has a real name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hate it when he calls me Marlboro.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin set the improvised spear down and turned his attention back to the fire. &amp;ldquo;You better get him under control.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You should open your package.&amp;rdquo; Said Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey wait a sec, aren&amp;rsquo;t you supposed to be dead?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, aren&amp;rsquo;t you supposed to be dead?&amp;rdquo; he said back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touche, Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who are you talking to?&amp;rdquo; asked Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spencer,&amp;rdquo; I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well stop that. It&amp;rsquo;s freaking us out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two candles burned from start to finish before Benjamin decided that help wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the way and our best chance of survival was to fight it out with the things outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagreed, but Benjamin informed me in his own polite way that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t up for vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He peeled back the layers of the barricade just enough to get a view of the outside. Once we knew what we were dealing with, we could come up with a better game plan. Only, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t actually get a good look because something was blocking the view. Something just on the other side of the glass doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin yanked the rest of the barricade down and took a few steps back to marvel at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, you don&amp;rsquo;t see that every day,&amp;rdquo; said Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, I can&amp;rsquo;t do it. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. His name is Marlboro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were trapped there, inside the gas station. On the other side of the doors, a network of trees had grown together, twisted into knots, and pressed against the glass. They were so densely pressed into a single wall of tree trunks that not even light could get through. For all we knew, it could have been daytime outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have to get out of here,&amp;rdquo; said Benjamin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked the back door, but it was the same thing. I often wondered how long a person could survive inside the gas station without any new supplies coming in. I had run the scenario in my head a million times. On boring nights, what else is there to do? I had run the thought experiment for countless different contexts. How long could I survive if the gas station were transported back in time? To another planet? If there were a zombie apocalypse? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I had deduced was that, under ideal circumstances, I could live off of the supplies on hand for four years if I could find a source of water. Six weeks if not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were not ideal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had already smashed up, weaponized, or eaten almost all of our supplies. If we were trapped here, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long for us to go all Donner party on each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was pondering this in the hallway by the cooler, we heard the sound of glass shattering from the main room. Benjamin raised his spear and led the way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wall of trees was still there on the other side of the doors. Our mess was still there. Everything was as we left it with one exception. The tarp was pulled back, and Spencer&amp;rsquo;s body was gone. A series of footprints coagulated in the blood leading from where he should have been to the shattered glass of the front door. Like he had just gotten up, walked over, and was absorbed into the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I need you boys to think real hard,&amp;rdquo; Benjamin said. &amp;ldquo;Is there any other way out of this place?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; Marlboro started. I shot him a look and shook my head, but I guess he couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it in the dim candlelight. Or maybe he was just too dense to understand. &amp;ldquo;There is that hole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hole? What hole?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The hole in the secret room back here past the cooler.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Secret? Room?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, right over here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro pointed at the blank space on the wall where the door used to be. The owners had decided that the smartest thing they could do when they found out about the secret room was remove the door, build a good-old fashioned wall, and forget all about it, but that only works if everyone agrees to forget all about it, Marlboro!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re telling me there&amp;rsquo;s a secret room behind there? And a hole in that room that we can maybe fit inside and escape? Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you boys tell me this earlier?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;rsquo;t wait for an answer. Benjamin went straight to the wall and started smashing it to pieces with his spear and then, after he got it down a little, his bare hands. After a minute, the wall was once again a door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Benjamin lit and placed a few candles around the giant hole in the floor, I grabbed Diego and pulled him aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey,&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I should tell you something. I opened that package. The one that looked like a present.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah?&amp;rdquo; He said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah.&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure at what point I&amp;rsquo;d finally cracked and opened it, but I had been carrying around the content of the box in my pocket for at least one candle. Just like the last package, there was a note with this one. It read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect you to use my letter as part of the story, but thanks LoL. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind you using it , that was very neat! I liked it. I was very surprised. Thank you. I enjoyed your stories and I knew it could be really great from the beginning. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wrote what I did. I was surprised, but in a good way, that you used my letter, lol. Thank you. I&amp;rsquo;m honored, really honored.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underneath that letter was a small handgun. I knew enough about pistols from playing video games to know how to check the clip and sure enough, it was loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed the gun to Diego, who said &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a Ruger 380!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is that good?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well it&amp;rsquo;s a gun, so it&amp;rsquo;ll probably have more stopping power than a chair leg. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you give it to him?&amp;rdquo; Diego gestured at our fearless leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know or trust him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good point.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here,&amp;rdquo; I said trying to hand it over, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not a gun guy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No way man. You keep it. I got both legs, you need it more than me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin yelled to us from the secret room, &amp;ldquo;Ya&amp;rsquo;ll ready or what? Time to see what&amp;rsquo;s down here.&amp;rdquo; Then he jumped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have neglected to mention that it was a ten foot drop to the cave floor below. I also may have taken a little pleasure in the sound of him crash landing and the pain moan that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, we rolled up a tarp and put some knots into it like a poorman&amp;rsquo;s rope ladder, and I have to give credit to tarps. Those things are incredibly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had spent hours aboveground in a room with a dead body, unrefrigerated food, and Benjamin&amp;rsquo;s body odor. We were all eating canned beans and I think somebody probably threw up in the garbage can. My point is this: we were all smelling pretty bad, to the point where I was doubting that I still had a sense of smell. But once we went into that hole, I knew for a fact that we hadn&amp;rsquo;t. The smell down there made our gas station funk seem like cologne. The very worst putrid odors from the storm drains around the station were nothing compared to this. Is it possible for a smell to be heavy? Because that&amp;rsquo;s the best word I can think of for it. Not thick. Just, heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego and Marlboro took turns barfing. When they were done, Benjamin handed out the torches he had made from gasoline soaked rags and chair legs. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what that guy&amp;rsquo;s deal is but he sure is crafty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cave was a straight tunnel starting under the gas station and heading away from town. It was plenty tall enough for all of us to stand comfortably, and there was a slight incline, taking us downhill as we walked further into the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What the hell is this?&amp;rdquo; Benjamin asked after about twenty feet. He waved his torch at the wall and I saw that somebody had spray-painted a message on the cave wall in red. It said in shaky handwriting: &amp;ldquo;Rita the Racoon Ate the Cacoon!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said it a few times in my head and was pissed off at just how close it came to rhyming but didn&amp;rsquo;t, like a song slightly off key. The handwriting was eerily familiar, especially that capital &amp;ldquo;R,&amp;rdquo; but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was another lawn gnome on the ground beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued further into the cave, Benjamin way ahead of us, me bringing up the tail, hobbling along the best I could with just a single crutch. The deeper we went, the narrower the cave, the stronger the smell. Nothing about being down here away from the gas station felt like an improvement from our previous situation. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until we made it to the tree that I really decided that we had messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long we had been walking down there. Maybe a half-mile or so. Crutch-miles feel a lot longer than normal miles. But we eventually came upon an enormous black tree taking up the width of the cave. It looked like one of those thousand year old sequoias, big enough to put a two-lane road through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ho. Lee. She. It.&amp;rdquo; enunciated Benjamin. I was the last to see what everyone else was wide-eyed and gawking at. The tree, in addition to being enormous, had some characteristics that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect a tree to have. Specifically, human body parts. A few arms and legs poking out at random spots. And right at eye level, a human face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey,&amp;rdquo; said Marlboro, &amp;ldquo;I know that guy. It&amp;rsquo;s Patrick.&amp;rdquo; He touched Patrick&amp;rsquo;s face and it peeled off and plopped to the ground like a wet Halloween mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think he&amp;rsquo;s going to make it,&amp;rdquo; Benjamin said as he pulled something out of his jacket pocket and stuck it to the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is that?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, it was Marlboro who answered. &amp;ldquo;That looks like C4 plastic explosives to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin chuckled, &amp;ldquo;Wow, you win the prize for that one, Rain Man. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s the last of my explosives. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to kill this thing piece at a time for the last week, but it just keeps growing back. I have to kill the root system, blow it up and kill the brain so the rest of the network will die.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That was you that put that bomb in the gas station,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, well, back then I thought the building was the epicenter of this whole thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey,&amp;rdquo; interrupted Diego, &amp;ldquo;Jack was still in the building when you planted that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Um, guys?&amp;rdquo; Marlboro tried to get their attention, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You knew? He would have died if that thing went off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Guys?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look assholes, this is war. And in war, there are always casualties. You can&amp;rsquo;t make peanut butter without smashing a few nuts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, guys!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?!&amp;rdquo; screamed Benjamin. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a little busy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro pointed back the way we came. We all turned to see Spencer standing in the middle of the path, a wicked smile on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hi. Miss me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego screamed at me, &amp;ldquo;Jack! The gun!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled the weapon out of my pocket and chucked it as hard as I could. It smacked Spencer right in the face and he fell over. I was very proud for the two seconds it took me to realize what I had done wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came next almost happened too quickly for me to comprehend. Something burst out of the wall next to us. An enormous object, the size of a car and mostly hand-shaped. It wrapped its giant fingers around the other three and pulled them into the wall. And then, I was falling. The earth had opened up below me and I was sliding through a dark tunnel. No, I was being pulled. More like swallowed, really. It went for a while, dirt filling my nose and ears and mouth and then whatever it was spat me out into a pitch black room onto a rocky wet piece of ground. I landed on my bad leg and probably broke it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I thought, at least this time I managed to hit Spencer. As far as last moments on earth go, this one was a slight improvement over last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room I was in was cool, not cold. And cavernous. I could hear my breath echoing off the walls. I could also hear something else breathing. All at once I became aware of another presence down there. An entity in the room with me. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain, in the same way I remember it being hard to explain a dream right after you wake up. It&amp;rsquo;s something you have to experience to understand, but the feeling was something like being plugged into a shared consciousness with another intelligence that was putting thoughts directly into my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it might have just been all the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Welcome to my home,&amp;rdquo; came a loud voice from somewhere in the pitch black room. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry it&amp;rsquo;s taken this long for us to meet face-to-face.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t see anything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, what part of ‘Dark God&amp;rsquo; don&amp;rsquo;t you understand?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh shit. I&amp;rsquo;m in the throne room of a dark god, and he sounds like an internet troll. I guess that makes sense. Might as well get this over with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you think you could maybe turn on some lights so I can actually see who I&amp;rsquo;m talking to?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He let out a very human sounding sigh and exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;Fiiine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, the entire room turned into an intense, furious bright white. All I could see was pure light. I covered my eyes, but even then I could see the bones of my hands through my eyelids. Even with the meds, that shit hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Too bright! Too bright!&amp;rdquo; I yelled, &amp;ldquo;Split the difference!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wow,&amp;rdquo; responded the voice, &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that you were going to be such a big baby.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, just as suddenly, the brightness relented. After a moment, my pupils adjusted and I could see what I had been talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Behold!&amp;rdquo; it exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;and tremble before the dark god!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He (if it was a &amp;ldquo;he,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m just going off of the sound of his voice) was about the size of an elephant, swollen and round with a tanned yellow hide. The best animal I could think of to compare him to would be an enormous tick, with six rows of stubby arms on either side, six rows of sagging breasts, and a human-sized head on the top. The head contained a somewhat human face and no neck. The body connected to the earth at the widest point of its stomach, like it was half buried. And, to top the whole thing off, he had a red mohawk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smiled at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eh? What do you think?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;About what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My hair! Isn&amp;rsquo;t it amazing?&amp;rdquo; He looked up at his mohawk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I guess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You guess? Do you have any idea how much effort I put into doing my hair like this? You know what, it&amp;rsquo;s fine. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have wasted my time trying to impress you. That&amp;rsquo;s on me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ok,&amp;rdquo; I said, attempting to push myself to my feet only to remember that my leg was pretty broken. I was immobilized, underground, high, and without any weapons. There really was no chance of escape. &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re going to kill me, do you mind just getting it over with?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is it with you people? SO UNTRUSTING. So prejudiced. Why is it that ANYTIME you see something you don&amp;rsquo;t understand, you think it&amp;rsquo;s kill-or-be-killed? I&amp;rsquo;m not the monster here. You are. I can see into your soul. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen your sins. Remember that time when you were fifteen and you keyed the principal&amp;rsquo;s car?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Really? Maybe that wasn&amp;rsquo;t you. Humans all look a lot alike.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why am I here? Why did you drag me underground?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because, Jack, I can&amp;rsquo;t find any other way of talking to you, and I wanted to tell you to stop killing my children! You&amp;rsquo;ve burned up so many of us, and what did we ever do to you, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Kieffer plants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, just backups because that idiot is so clumsy. They&amp;rsquo;re harmless though. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to put some people in office so I can get a little political influence in this awful town.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To take over the world?&amp;rdquo; I asked, even though I was starting to see where this conversation was going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No! I want to pressure the city council to cut back on logging. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to save the world. But you and your awful friends keep killing us and trying to blow me up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But Spencer, he beat the shit out of me. That guy is awful, and he&amp;rsquo;s following your orders!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well excuse me for thinking that people have the potential to be rehabilitated! I hired Spencer because I needed someone to protect Kieffer. And I gave him very specific orders not to kill anyone, which he agreed to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But you&amp;rsquo;ve killed tons of people! The cultists! Their entire compound!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, actually no. I hate to be the one to say this, but those guys killed themselves. Yeah, it was a really sad mass suicide. But if you listened to them, I think it was pretty obvious. You guys should have seen it coming from a mile away. I mean, consequentialism mixed with a moral obligation to end suffering?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He waved one of his six arms in a jerk-off motion before continuing, &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to let all those perfectly good fully-formed adult bodies go to waste. Do you even know how hard it is to make one of those from scratch? It&amp;rsquo;s not easy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But you sent those things after us at the gas station.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Again with the self-centered hero complex. It was never about you. I sent my children to bring Spencer&amp;rsquo;s body back here. I was hoping I could get him home in time to rebuild him without any permanent brain damage. I think next time you see him, you should apologize for what happened. I swear, ever since Romero made zombies cool, people see a dead man come back to life and instantly they get this urge to kill, kill, kill. What ever happened to calling this a miracle? Nobody freaked out when Jesus came back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you saying that Jesus was like those Mathmetists? Just a reanimated corpse?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is this really what you want to talk about, Jack?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But doesn&amp;rsquo;t ‘dark god&amp;rsquo; mean, like, evil?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The last time I was awake, dark god had a completely different connotation. But you can&amp;rsquo;t use my branding as your excuse for burning up Kieffer. You ask me, you deserved the ass-whooping you got.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I searched my mind for any proof that the dark god was the monster I knew him to be. But the only thing I could come up with was a sad icy-cold realization. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re the monsters?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good. That&amp;rsquo;s a start.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So this is it? You&amp;rsquo;re the reason for all the weird stuff going on out here at the gas station?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laughed again and wiggled his head, which I took for his version of shaking &amp;ldquo;no.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nope. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest with you, I have no clue what half of these things are. Your gas station is weird, and even I do not know why. The hand plants and Kieffers were me. The smell, I&amp;rsquo;ll fess up. That&amp;rsquo;s me too. But all that other stuff, man, it gives me the heeby jeebies. You know that weird glowing worm-bug thing? That was pretty weird huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So&amp;hellip; What do we do now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now, I send you and your friends back home, and you quit killing me. That&amp;rsquo;s my deal. Can we agree to that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Um, yeah, I think so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Should we shake hands or-&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment an enormous hand burst out of the wall and wrapped its fingers tightly around me. The next thing I knew, I was coughing up dirt, down on all fours in the street outside of the gas station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh good,&amp;rdquo; said Benjamin, &amp;ldquo;You made it out too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked over and saw the other three standing there, covered in black dirt. I was back where it started. The trees were all gone, leaving no sign that they were ever even there in the first place. The gas station was a wreck, the front doors were smashed out and the racoons were excitedly running a loot train for whatever edibles they could carry from the front to their nest behind back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What happened, man?&amp;rdquo; asked Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure,&amp;rdquo; I answered, digging the clumps of dirt out of my nose and ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, you&amp;rsquo;re lucky. Your friends made me wait a few minutes to give you a chance to get out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at my hands, they were nearly black from all the layers of dirt coating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wait for what?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For this,&amp;rdquo; Benjamin answered as he pressed the button on his remote detonator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere deep in the woods came an explosion that rocked the earth and sent birds flying into the sky. Diego&amp;rsquo;s car alarm went off and the pavement cracked. A black cloud slowly started to fill the sky and I felt something inside my mind scream and die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whelp,&amp;rdquo; said Benjamin. &amp;ldquo;My work here is done. If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind, I&amp;rsquo;m going to get lost before five-o shows up.&amp;rdquo; Then he walked off into the forest, hopefully never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s what happened. If you can believe it, I&amp;rsquo;m back at the gas station, working again. Arnold is on personal leave from the police force and I didn&amp;rsquo;t care to ask for details, so we have a new deputy babysitting us. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you all about her another time, maybe. The police investigated the incident, and ultimately concluded that we were victims of hysteria brought on by a gas leak, and once again, there was nothing supernatural to be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is the end for the dark god, but I do know that I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt any compulsions to continue digging ever since Benjamin blew up that underground tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are settling back into our brand of normal. I still work way too much. I&amp;rsquo;m still keeping a journal. And weird things still happen at the shitty gas station at the edge of town. In fact, just yesterday people started reporting that they had seen something in the woods that looked like an enormous racoon with bat wings, stealing small animals before flying off into the forest. They even said this winged racoon monster glows in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlboro just came up to me and asked, &amp;ldquo;You know there&amp;rsquo;s a guy in the bathroom dressed like a cowboy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assured him that I did not know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be the last update for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a lot of work putting this place back together, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got a whole new crew of part-timers to train, so until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Jack from the Gas Station&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Part Eight</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be my final update for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have deteriorated here to a degree that I didn&amp;rsquo;t foresee. I didn’t know how much writing about the things that are happening out here would affect every single part of my life, and maybe that was stupid of me. Maybe I should have considered it more seriously, but honestly I just thought I was writing about things that a few people would want to hear. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it would get this much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People ask me about the stairs now. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen every day, but when it does happen, I never really know what to say. My bosses know someone is talking about them, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure that if they know, the higher-ups know. And I can tell you that they aren&amp;rsquo;t happy about it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been formally told that I am not to speak a word about them to anyone anymore, which is part of the reason this has to be my final update. I can&amp;rsquo;t risk my job for this; as much as it&amp;rsquo;s been wonderful to get a lot of these things off my mind, I still do love my work, and I need to be out here. If anything, my being aware of what&amp;rsquo;s really going on is enough reason to stick it out. I may not be able to tell people that they&amp;rsquo;re out there, but if I see them, I can direct traffic away to somewhere safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the amount of attention the stories have gotten, I’ve heard a lot of stories being swapped back and forth. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard so many I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember most of them. The ones I do remember are the ones that I wish I could forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One story that&amp;rsquo;s made the rounds here was about a young woman who disappeared upstate. Initially, everyone assumed she was a runaway. She didn’t come from a great home life, and so it really wasn&amp;rsquo;t any kind of surprise that she&amp;rsquo;d choose to cut and run. But people started coming forward saying that they&amp;rsquo;d seen her around the park shortly before she vanished, so some of the Rangers in the area were sent out to make sure she hadn&amp;rsquo;t hung herself or something on any of the back trails. It took them a while, but they did find her. Well, not all of her. Just half of her tongue and a quarter of the lower jaw. Very clean cuts, from what I heard. They&amp;rsquo;ve never found the rest of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many stories about children. So many of them going missing and turning up in caves, wedged in between impossibly tight spaces. So many of them found on mountain peaks, or at the bottoms of sheer gullies. Missing shoes, missing socks, or found with both in perfect condition despite them being miles and miles away from where they vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many stories of black-eyed people, wandering around the woods and calling out in the night, mimicking the sound of running water or a bobcat screaming. One man in particular goes to every news station he thinks will listen to him and tells the same story. He was deer hunting, had camped out in a very remote area, and woke up because something was scraping against his tent. He thought it was a raccoon or a fox until the thing pressed its face against the door of the tent, at which point he could very clearly make out a human nose and mouth. He kicked at it, but it leaped back and was gone by the time he opened the tent flap, gun at his side. He fired two warning shots, and when the sound had faded, he heard a snap behind him. A man was standing at the edge of the campsite. This man was not wearing any clothing, but he also didn’t possess any kind of human flesh. As this hunter described it, the man was made of some kind of amalgamation of raw meat and hair. As if someone had scooped up roadkill and molded it into the vague shape of a man. The face was lumpy and only a rough approximation of a human face. The thing opened its lopsided mouth, and from it came the sound of the gun the hunter had fired. It did this twice before mimicking the sound of the tent zipper and fleeing into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young couple, out for a hike in the rocky areas of my park, reported to me yesterday that they had seen something strange out on a peak I&amp;rsquo;m very familiar with. They were taking turns looking through a pair of binoculars when the man noticed a hiker climbing up a very steep part of the cliff face. He watched the man scale the slope, and it didn’t occur to him until the incident was over that this person had no climbing gear. When the climber reached the top of the peak, which was about five miles away, they turned and faced the young man. He said whoever, or whatever, this person was, was looking right at them. The climber waved in an exaggerated manner before snapping in half at the waist, sideways, and leaping off the peak. The young man didn&amp;rsquo;t see where the climber landed. I sent them on their way with assurances that I’d check it out. I lied. I won&amp;rsquo;t be turning in a report, because there are ten others exactly like it. The climber is well known in that area. I don&amp;rsquo;t question it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many things I won&amp;rsquo;t ever be able to understand about my job, and it would take me years to relate all of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve heard in the last few months. When I feel like my job isn&amp;rsquo;t in jeopardy, I will come back. It may be in a different format, but I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; come back. Thank you all for sticking by my side, and enjoying the things I’ve talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go out into the woods, I encourage you to be safe. Bring water, food, survival equipment. Let people know where you&amp;rsquo;re going and when you&amp;rsquo;ll be back. Don&amp;rsquo;t go on uncharted paths unless you know exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And above all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t touch them. Don&amp;rsquo;t look at them. Don&amp;rsquo;t go up them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Chapter 8: Finale</title>
		<link>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 01:47:34 -0600</pubDate>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh dear god.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was my first thought on realizing I would have to fight &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo;, the creature
that tormented me through nearly the whole game. How would I be able to fight
something that can kill with one touch? It seemed totally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Red was no longer able to deliver one hit kills. But despite that,
this was still the most difficult battle I&amp;rsquo;ve ever faced, in this game or
otherwise. If I had any real comprehension of what I was getting into before I
started the fight, I would never have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very soon learned what a horrible mistake I had made. Red reached out and
clawed at Godzilla. And when those claws cut through him, I felt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Firstblood.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Firstblood.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Red attacking Godzilla&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that it&amp;rsquo;s common for people to cringe up when their video game character
gets hit or loses a life. But this was not that. This was genuine, physical
pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pain struck me I paused the game. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t suffered any actual
injuries, but it felt just like my shoulder had been clawed through. I had seen
and experienced many unpleasant things at this point, but the game causing me
real pain was where I drew the line. Yes, I would be disappointed that I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get to see the ending, but the risk was no longer worth it. I was about
to get up to take one last screenshot and turn off the NES, when I realized
something else&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was paralyzed to my seat. The only muscles I could move were my fingers and
thumbs. As the terror set in, a new message appeared on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Youarenotleaving.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Youarenotleaving.png&#34;  alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;YOU ARE NOT LEAVING&amp;rdquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to scream, but only a weak choking sound was coming out. I desperately
tried to get my body to move, but it did nothing. I was looking every direction,
and then I looked over at the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the computer was taking screenshots of the game on its own when I began
the fight. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how or why. Something in the game must have been
causing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Red could hear what I was saying, I tried begging for him to let me go.
From here things start to get hazy as I was under extreme stress at the time,
but from what I can remember I said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I insulted you. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know things
would get this serious. Please just let me go. If you let me go I promise I will
never tell anyone or turn the game on ever again. PLEASE!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Red replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/96xft0.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/96xft0.png&#34;  alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;YOU PATHETIC WORM IT&amp;rsquo;S TOO LATE NOW&amp;rdquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Onlyone.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Onlyone.png&#34;  alt=&#34;&amp;ldquo;ONLY ONE WILL SURVIVE&amp;rdquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Only one will survive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement could not be any more clear. If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t kill Red, then he would
kill ME. Like an idiot I had played around with something I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand,
and now it might cost me my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped struggling to move and accepted the reality of the situation. There
was only one way to get out of this alive. I had to kill Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all went by so fast. If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the screenshots, I might not have
remembered any of this. Just like in the chase levels, Red moved at a
horrifyingly fast speed. There was barely enough time to process a thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thus, there was no time to form a strategy. I had to rely solely on my wits
and reflexes. To make things worse, there was no way to predict what kind of
attacks Red might use, so I constantly had to be on the offensive AND defensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt every hit that Godzilla took. They all hurt. I tried so hard to avoid the
damage, but every attack that I dodged left me vulnerable to another. And the
pain would only get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he jumped over me, Red&amp;rsquo;s eyes started to glow. I moved as far back as I
could and ducked, but there was no dodging this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When THIS hit me, I really did scream. I screamed so loud that someone else in
the apartment should have heard me, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t. Just looking at the image
hurts me, making me remember the incinerating burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paused the game because it hurt so bad, but Red unpaused the game to attack me
again, which made me furious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately counterattacked with the heat beam, again and again until the
power meter was totally diminished. I wanted Red to hurt like I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before the timer ran out, Red transitioned into his swimming form. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
think the timer would still be affecting a battle like this. I&amp;rsquo;m thankful for
it, because it gave me a few minutes to collect my thoughts and decide what to
do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to fight Red&amp;rsquo;s next 2 forms with the monsters I had encountered them
with, so Anguirus was next. It probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that smart of an idea, but
it&amp;rsquo;s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I jumped up and heat beamed Red in the face, and he moved offscreen where I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach him. Then a wave of large mines started to fall from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt this was unfair so I shouted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re going to cheat, then why do you even let me use the controller?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he came at me, rushing from the top left of the screen downwards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Swimmingred4.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;DAMN IT!&amp;rdquo; Now I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be able to see where his next attack was coming
from. Red continued to strike from random angles, I constantly moved to swerve
around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another forty seconds went by and Anguirus was nearly gone, but together we had
forced Red into his flying form, so it was Mothra&amp;rsquo;s turn next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Flyingred1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding to fight Red with Mothra was a terrible idea. Mothra was instantly
overwhelmed by Red, and the life meter was devastated in a mere fifteen seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Flyingred2.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once Mothra&amp;rsquo;s life was down to two bars, Red did something I didn&amp;rsquo;t see
coming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/nes-godzilla/chapter-8-finale/Flyingred3.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reached out, grabbed Mothra, and ate her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Mothra was devoured I felt an agonizing pain, like being crushed to death.
Mothra had been killed for my stupidity and I would share the pain. It was a
short transition from the battle to the board, but it felt like an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pain, combined with being unable to move was driving me insane. I wanted so
badly for this to end. I never wanted anything so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still had hope. There was only one monster left that could be brought to
full health by engaging Red in battle. Solomon. If any of them had a chance to
save my life now, it would be him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon apparently has some history with Red, as when the fight started this
dialogue happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red took me by surprise again by immediately burning me with his demonic fire a
second time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as it hurt, it actually worked to my advantage: since Solomon started at
full life he still had some to spare, but now Red had used up all his energy and
could not use his ultimate weapon any longer. Now he would die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he drew close to the end of his life bar, Red turned his whole body to face
the screen and flew upwards, then slamming back down in an attempt to crush
Solomon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that failed to work, he tried to devour Solomon like he had Mothra. But he
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be eating my monster this time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought I had won. But something was wrong. Red wasn&amp;rsquo;t sinking to the bottom,
and I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t move. Red was still alive&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his seeming defeat by Solomon, Red had reconstructed his body into his
gigantic Final Form, transporting us to a blazing inferno in the process. It was
reminiscent of our first encounter. Except now the scenery,much like the true
power of Red, had become very real. The music had erupted into a loud blaring
sound, a furious drum of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced against Red&amp;rsquo;s insane amount of health, my own demise was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon was my strongest monster. But not even he stood a chance. It was like
trying to fight a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within seconds Solomon was overpowered and dropped to the floor, when Red
crushed him to death underneath his foot. The sadistic demon took his time as he
snapped Solomon&amp;rsquo;s vertebrae and ribs like dry, brittle twigs. I could tell he
was enjoying our pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is hopeless. I&amp;rsquo;m a dead man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to no choice but to send another monster to his death. We were all going
to die. I only hoped they would forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decreasing Red&amp;rsquo;s health by a miniscule amount, Anguirus was also
obliterated. Red unleashed a hail of blazing hot needles into his face, until he
collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I understood why I was mocked about Melissa&amp;rsquo;s death, and how the game knew
about it. Because HE knew about it, because HE was the one responsible. And this
time, he was going to kill me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of everything that was happening, I had completely forgotten about
it. I tried yet again to select it. I cursed, I begged,I screamed at it to do
something, ANYTHING to help me. To no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was only one thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew Godzilla didn&amp;rsquo;t stand any more of a chance than the rest did. But maybe,
maybe now that all the other monsters were gone, the fifth monster might finally
awaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then that Red decided he was done playing fair, and before I could
activate the monster, he went for the killing blow: paralyzing my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hands started to become numb and unfeeling, but even as my vision was fading
away, I still tried to pressed the A button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red surely was breaking one of his rules, but he must have thought that if he
could kill me quickly, then it would be too late for any consequences to matter,
he would have won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

had more to fight her for than just my own life, I had to fight to save Melissa,
and the world she inhabits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With her help, the 5th monster was finally unleashed:&lt;/p&gt;

we were to have any chance of surviving. His &amp;ldquo;punch&amp;rdquo; involved turning his hands
into blades, which caused tremendous damage. But Red had more than enough life
to spare. In the end, this would come down to pure skill:&lt;/p&gt;

accompanied by a soar of triumphant music. Slowly, the paralysis wore off, and I
was able to stand up again!&lt;/p&gt;

All the other monsters who had fought and died. I was about to mourn them, but
the game had yet to conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tears of joy streamed down my face, and I broke out crying. I cried harder than
I have in several years, maybe in whole life. All I had been through, all I had
discovered, and now the game was coming to an end. But before she and the others
left, Melissa had something to tell me:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Part Nine</title>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, hasn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know everyone says it but time has this really strange way of flowing when you&amp;rsquo;re an adult. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m at that age where I&amp;rsquo;m in between being a kid and getting old. Or maybe that&amp;rsquo;s your entire life. In between things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s summer now, which means we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a massive influx of people in the parks. We&amp;rsquo;re an incredibly popular camping destination because of our large amount of camp sites in various scenic areas, and in the summer season these camps are almost always operating at almost to full capacity at any given time. We&amp;rsquo;re well staffed, and we all of us know what to look for, what to expect. We have teams standing by in the event of any kind of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, people still manage to slip away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in response to a couple of other incidents at the same site, we installed a camper near the entrance, and a Ranger stays out there every night. We rotate, so everyone spends one night a week there. I chose Wednesdays, as these tend to be relatively low-key, with only our long-term guys around. This particular day had been humid, like the inside of a locked car. All of us were relatively miserable, but the camper had a small AC unit, and the campers and I took turns sitting in it until the sun went down. We all bedded down, and I had the AC turned up as high as it would go. It&amp;rsquo;s a loud unit, so I had earplugs in. The camper is tiny but comfortable and I fell asleep relatively quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up in total silence and it took me a minute to realize that that was the problem. The AC had stopped, and there was absolutely no sound outside. I sat up and the sheets didn&amp;rsquo;t make any noise. I clapped. Nothing. I yelled. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has happened to me before. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer that it&amp;rsquo;s some kind of strange acoustical phenomenon, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s caused by the wind. I got out of bed and yanked on my boots and flew out the door. I ran to the edge of the campsite, about 500 feet away, and somewhere behind the trees there was something darker than the space around it. I headed for it, but I must have misjudged its distance because it took longer to get there than it should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;d split a tree in half. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen lightning do that a few times but not this cleanly. This cut was surgical. The bushes underneath it had been crushed, and I could faintly make out the shape of something furry. A raccoon, I suspected. The intestines bursting out of its eye sockets were already attracting flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stairs were concrete, old. I could make out the lines of graffiti on the lower steps. A metal handrail bowed out haphazardly, most of the supports bent or gone. Ten, maybe twelve steps. In a rush the sound of the world came back and I heard the faint electrical snap of a fly exploding near my ear. I sprinted back to camp. I grabbed the rifle out of the pickup I&amp;rsquo;d taken to the site and stood at the edge of camp, my back to the woods. I stood there and watched until the sun came up. I watched the whole camp, every tent. I know I never fell asleep, and no one came into or out of camp, so I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how the woman got away. Her tent was in my direct line of site. As best I can guess, she must have gotten out when I was turned away for a second. They&amp;rsquo;re hopeful that she&amp;rsquo;s still alive, of course, but I think we&amp;rsquo;ll have to close that part of the park for a while. Officially, we&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on things. But I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take much comfort in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re keeping an eye on a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting a lot of messages about the length and quality of this post. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, guys, I know it&amp;rsquo;s not as detailed or as long as my past updates. I wrote it in the middle of the night after getting home from an emergency at the park, which I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss later. I needed to vent a bit, I guess. Perhaps I should have waited to write all this down when my mind, and my memory, were a bit clearer. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to make the next update a little more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Epilogue</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Zachary, and at the time I write this, it has been three weeks since the
fateful night when I played the NES Godzilla game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to that night, to immediately after I turned off the NES. Once I was
able to start walking around again, the first thing I did was unplug the NES,
take out the cartridge, and put them in separate sock drawers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked over at the computer. All the screenshots you&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the story were
saved. I backed up all the images on a flash drive before I turned the computer
off, just in case. After that, I hit the bed and instantly passed out. It was
not a restful sleep, but one of complete exhaustion. It felt like no time has
passed before I awoke again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what a day that was. The first thought I recall coming to mind was &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;What
the hell happened last night?&amp;rdquo; I thought about it for a short while, until it
occurred to me to contact the person I got the game from to begin with, Billy.
So I called him up, and told him to just come over to my apartment, which he
did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I showed him the screenshots, and gave him a very basic summary of what had
happened. At first he thought I was pulling a joke on him, but he soon realized
that was not the case. Once it hit him that this was real, he was speechless. He
made it clear that he had absolutely not tampered with the game, and had no idea
about any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the obvious question was asked to Billy; &amp;ldquo;Where did YOU get it from?&amp;rdquo; I
got the simple answer of &amp;ldquo;Another friend of mine that I trade games with.&amp;rdquo; He
assured me that this was a trustworthy person, and he had never had any issues
with games he got from him before. So then Billy called him. But when we told
this guy the story, he was as shocked and surprised as anyone, except he
abruptly hung up on us. This clearly was going nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Billy left that day, he asked me if I wanted him to take the cartridge
and dispose of it. I sharply declined. He asked how I could possibly still want
to keep the thing. I told him that I needed time to think it over, and that was
that. Billy and I haven&amp;rsquo;t talked much since. Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve told him this
isn&amp;rsquo;t the case, I get the impression that Billy thinks what happened with the
game is his fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he left that day, I did a lot of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very hard for me to do anything else, really. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking
about the game, there were so many questions left unanswered. What WAS Red? Was
Melissa really in the game? How did she get there? Why did all this happen with
THIS game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the one question that kept me for many nights was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Red said he had &amp;lsquo;known me for a long time&amp;rsquo;. How?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, I can&amp;rsquo;t shake this feeling of being watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game made me ask myself questions about death and reality in ways that I
never wanted to think about. I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure of anything anymore. Constantly
thinking about it soon began to have a negative impact on my life. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t
care about anything else at this point. By comparison, all the other day-to-day
activities seemed utterly pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually decided that I had to choose between one of two things: Try to play
the game again, or destroy it. I tried several times to convince myself to try
the former, but I never got farther than plugging the NES back up. Just touching
the cartridge made me remember all the pain I felt during the fight with Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered if perhaps playing the game again myself might cause something
terrible to happen. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about how this &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; worked, and it
was too risky. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I could stand another round of the game anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then it was time for the other option. Wanting to get some fresh air, I took
the game with me and drove to the lake, planning to throw it in. I got up to the
lake with the cartridge in my hands, and I look down on it and&amp;hellip; I thought of
Melissa. If what I had experienced in the game was indeed genuine, doing what I
did may have been the only way to save her from endless torture. In a way, this
warped game might have saved her soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn it. Once that thought came into my head, I knew then I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to
destroy it. So I just sat down at a bench, gazing at the lake for about an hour.
Ultimately, I decided on a third option: selling the game on EBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be selfish, but I promise you that it has nothing to do with money. I
don&amp;rsquo;t care how much or little I get paid for this game, believe me. It&amp;rsquo;s selfish
because I don&amp;rsquo;t want the responsibility of owning this cartridge anymore. I
cannot dwell on this forever, and the only way I can deal with this, is by
putting the game out of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this brings me to the main reasons I created a summary of these events; first
is to record the details while I can remember them, and second is that whoever
bids on this game knows what they&amp;rsquo;re getting into. I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee the safety
of anyone else who plays the game, or that anything will happen at all. But to
the new owner of the gamer, remember this; Be careful, and if you feel as if the
game is literally messing with your mind, SHUT THE DAMN THING OFF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on call twenty-four hours a day now. It&amp;rsquo;s not the greatest thing in the world but it pays the bills, and sometimes they let me leave early or take extra days off if I&amp;rsquo;m tired. There&amp;rsquo;s not that much going on at night of course but occasionally one of us has to run out and deal with something. An animal sighting, a missing person, drunk people shooting each other, that sort of thing. All in all, I get called out about a dozen times a month for some kind of night-time emergency. Generally, the calls go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A text and a phone call from my boss. Fifteen minutes to get out the door dressed in my uniform. Thirty to work, then anywhere from five minutes to eight hours dealing with the issue. If it&amp;rsquo;s a missing person or the cops are involved, up to two days without sleep. The worst was a murder-suicide. That took a week. By the end of it I was in the hospital with severe fatigue and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss knows I&amp;rsquo;ll pick up as soon as he calls, but I don&amp;rsquo;t always hear texts. Usually he&amp;rsquo;ll text first in case I&amp;rsquo;m up, but otherwise he&amp;rsquo;ll get me on the phone. He is the only one who contacts me in this situations. That&amp;rsquo;s always been our system in the past. So you can imagine my surprise when I got a call from him at two in the morning and saw I had seventy, seven-zero, missed texts from just about every single person in our department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, what&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo; I said, sitting up. I&amp;rsquo;m great at faking being awake on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cleetwood Trail, south entrance. It&amp;rsquo;s bad. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about your clothes, just get out there.&amp;rdquo; He was breathing heavy and he didn&amp;rsquo;t wait for me to finish my greeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo; I was concerned now. My boss is unflappable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just get out there. It&amp;rsquo;s bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I immediately thought of the murder-suicide. It took us days to find all the pieces of their skulls. &amp;ldquo;How bad?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;K.D is on her way. Call when you&amp;rsquo;ve figured it out.&amp;rdquo; He hung up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;d never sent another Ranger up before me. I scrolled through the barrage of texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;omg russ what the hell is going on?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dude what the fuck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&amp;rsquo;m sorry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;whats going on out there???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CALL ME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CALL (BOSS&amp;rsquo; NAME) RIGHT NOW OMG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I threw my clothes on and was out the door in about five minutes. The drive took about fifteen minutes going ninety on the freeway and along the way my phone kept pinging notifications. I turned it off and tossed it in the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got there K.D was waiting for me. Something about her face was wrong and in the non-existent light I had to get close to her to see that she was wearing a respirator. The smell was like a wall. I ran into it about five feet from her and gagged. I took the respirator she handed me and strapped it on, coughing and doubled over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bad, huh?&amp;rdquo; She quipped, her voice muffled. She patted me on the back. &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed her into the forest and even behind the filters I could still smell it. Believe me, it bothers me as much as it does anyone else when people say that something is &amp;lsquo;indescribable&amp;rsquo; but I really do not know how to paint an accurate picture of what it was like. Imagine taking a fish and filling it full of other dead fish. Put the stuffed fish in a bag made out of the skin of even more dead fish and leave the bag sitting in the sun for a few days. Sprinkle some halitosis and rotting grass on top of the bag, let it sit another few days. Now open the bag and stick your head in and take a nice big breath. That should give you an idea of what it was like from half a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard to be heard through the respirators so we didn&amp;rsquo;t talk much while we walked. Neither of us really wanted our mouths open anyway. I kept thinking about how smells are composed of particulate and a few times I had to stop and lift the respirator to spit and dry heave. K.D clapped me on the back, almost knocking me off balance and sending my spit flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gross, huh?&amp;rdquo; She said, half-shouting. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s only worse from here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave her a weak thumbs-up and we kept going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;d taken the van with our on-site equipment inside, and she&amp;rsquo;d been there long enough to have carted a couple of portable spotlights to the scene. As we crested a hill, I could see them shining on something. Something huge. The top of the thing crested out of the trees in places, a huge grey behemoth. I shot her a look but she just grinned and waved me ahead. The smell was thick enough now to almost be visible and something crunched under my feet. The robin I&amp;rsquo;d crushed was still alive and it raised one wing weakly. I crushed its skull and moved on but there were others. They remained where they&amp;rsquo;d fallen, their sides heaving and an occasional wing raised and dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Smell got &amp;rsquo;em, I think.&amp;rdquo; K.D said, kicking a bird off the path. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a raccoon up here too. Took one bite and died. It was hilarious. Come look.&amp;rdquo; I stepped around the birds and the light filtered through the trees, shining on their little oil-drop eyes. The path straightened and up ahead I could see that the hulking thing, whatever it was, had fallen right across it about three hundred yards ahead. I broke into a jog and K.D kept pace. I went as close as I could until the smell was too much, and then I just stood while K.D kept going. She kicked the thing and spread her arms out, taking it all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way she&amp;rsquo;d illuminated it, only parts were really visible. It rose up, an impenetrable wall, and disappeared into the tops of the trees. The sporadic but careful lighting gave it an almost reverent quality, like an artifact on display. Either way I looked, the thing stretched into the dark. K.D walked the length of it to my right, until I could barely make her out in the dark. I craned my head up and could just see the edge, where it curved and dipped back down. I forced myself closer to the rubbery surface of the thing. It was greyish, darker in the light, and the surface was scarred and stippled with white marks. K.D came back and walked down to the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mere!&amp;rdquo; She called. I followed, not taking my eyes off the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked, kept walking, her hand sometimes brushing the thing, and up ahead now I could see something sticking out of the side of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Know what it is now?&amp;rdquo; I could hear that she was grinning, enjoying the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was some kind of thick flap, huge, bigger than both of us combined. One side was attached to the thing; it hung to the ground, where it rested in the dirt. At the place where the flap joined the wall, there were strange protrusions. Ignoring the smell now I looked closer. There were many of them, in various sizes. Small, grainy craters. That&amp;rsquo;s when the pieces fit together and I backed off, stumbling over myself and almost falling into the dirt. K.D lifted the pectoral flipper with great effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You imagine how strong they have to be to move these things? Wish it still had its tail.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran forward and kept going until above my head I could see something reflecting the light, just barely. Something liquid and glassy, just beginning to fog with bacteria and decay. The mouth was slightly open and the algae in the baleen was beginning to rot. Suddenly there was a loud, wheezing exhale and the thing moved, just slightly. The mouth opened showing more of the slimy, putrid baleen and from somewhere far down on the other end there was a creak, and a thud I felt rather than heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Holy shit.&amp;rdquo; K.D whispered. &amp;ldquo;Thought it died an hour ago. You feel that? It&amp;rsquo;s still trying.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The milky eye moved too look at me and there was another, weaker exhale and as we stared at each other the whale opened its mouth a little more, closed it, and died. The light left the blind eye and the entire corpse sagged, letting off more of that horrific stench. K.D was still talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s another of those clean cuts. Right through the whole back of it. If you go around the other side it&amp;rsquo;s missing that fin and a big slice of its skin. But the tail&amp;rsquo;s totally gone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t break away, couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop looking into the cataract that was forming, all the bacteria now free to multiply and turn everything to liquid. Through the baleen I could just make out the bulk of the tongue and it was already losing color, already being eaten from the inside, and I ran as far away as I could before doubling over and vomiting. K.D came over and patted my back. When it was over, I wiped my mouth and put the respirator back on. Now I went back to the corpse and began walking the length of it, shutting off every light. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand to see it lit so beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t even know who to call.&amp;rdquo; K.D said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down at the other end I could see the clean slice, where the tail had been taken off. No boat propeller could have done it, but that was no surprise. I knew what had. I wondered how big they had been. Down there in the deepest dark, where only whales could go. It answered a theory I&amp;rsquo;d had for some time. The stairs were impartial. Deep down in my gut there was a glassy, obsidian panic that was so familiar now as to be unnoticeable except when more weight was added. Suddenly, more than anything, I wanted to be at home in the dark, and I told K.D who to call, what to do, so that I could hand her my respirator and begin the walk back to my truck. Never looking back at the corpse cresting the trees, the top of it growing its own forest of birds, feasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll leave it to rot. We&amp;rsquo;ll say a water spout sucked up fish from one of the lakes and dumped them out there. When the bones are the only thing left, we&amp;rsquo;ll dispose of them, and the trail will re-open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove back home and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>I Was Hired by the US Navy to Investigate a Strange Wreck in the North Sea</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, I was a PhD student in biology and attended an ESA conference (mostly presenting some astrobiology related research results, nothing fancy or controversial). During a networking event, a US Navy officer who was attending the conference struck up a conversation with me. He seemed particularly interested in my research background and, after some small talk, casually suggested I apply for a military sponsored research project. He said they needed biologists for a study in the North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no gf, no pets, no immediate career plans, and the pay was good. So I applied. The selection process was bit hysterical. Security clearances, background checks, even questions about an old high school friend I hadn’t talked to in years (I learned he is gay and living in China). By that point I knew this wasn’t a regular project, but still, I had nothing to hide, so I went along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months, I was flown to Germany, where I met the rest of the team. They were mostly young, promising but not yet established in their respectable fields. People who could disappear for months without raising too many questions. From there, we were taken by boat to an oil rig somewhere in the North Sea. Our phones were confiscated on the way there, but we were warned about that in advance so no biggie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research base was either purpose built for the project or was an oil rig refitted for it, but from the outside it looked like a regular drilling station, probably to avoid scrutiny. Around 30 people were there engineers, biologists, linguists, and military personnel overseeing the whole thing. We could send and receive emails to family, but they were reviewed by navy personnel, no attachments allowed. Otherwise no internet access, no calls home etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/i-was-hired-by-us-navy-to-investigate-strange-wreck-in-the-north-sea/p09091bs.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;p09091bs.jpg&#34;   title=&#34;Pic unrelated&#34;  loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Pic unrelated&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They told us that a private oil company had discovered a strange structure on the seabed. At first, they thought it was a WWII submarine wreck, but sonar imaging ruled that out. What they found instead was an elongated, spike-like object, about 50 meters long, broken in half, embedded in a crater as if it had impacted at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, the engineers were debating how to bring it to the surface. Inflatable flotation devices were considered, but the risk of braking the object was too high. Instead, they deployed remote controlled robots that could take pictures and retrieve samples. The depth made human diving impractical, especially since most of us weren’t trained for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exterior of the object was encrusted with barnacles, seaweed, sediment and so on. Cleaning it took two more weeks. The outer layer was a carbon composite that was brittle, shattering like glass when dropped, but at the same time, it was almost impossible to bend or melt. We didn’t receive exact results on dating while I was still there, but based on how overgrown it was it must have spent centuries at the sea floor at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first month, only the engineers had anything to do. Then, five weeks in, they found a sealed, pressurized compartment. The engineers built an external pressurized seal to access the chamber. Inside, we found what was unmistakably a control room. No oxygen, dust-covered consoles, broken panels. And three bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two were small about a meter tall, humanoid but weird. Their heads looked oversized for their bodies, but probably would be normal sized on a regular human. Hairless, no ears or noses, though there were signs these had been removed surgically. They were also castrated. Their eyes were covered by black lenses, implanted directly into the sockets, a bit like built in sunglasses. At first we thought they were naked but eventually we figured out they were wearing skin tight suits that had until now decayed to dust. X-rays and ultrasound scans showed their bodies were riddled with metallic implants, like tiny shards of metal. We thought they were shrapnel from the crash but they were distributed too deliberately to be accidental. The bodies were still connected to their seats by cables plugged directly into the backs of their skulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third body was different. It was tall over 2 meters, with more human proportions, with long white hair (it was probably just bleached from the passage of time though) and it was female. No surgical mutilations. She had implants too, but fewer, and in different areas. She also had an artificial kidney. Her suit, unlike the others, was mostly intact. Underneath it we found plenty of tattoos. They resembled handwriting but didn’t match any inscriptions we found so it probably meant something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of death was obvious all of them were killed by the impact, with the female’s head nearly detaching from her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linguists attempted to analyse the symbols on the control panels, but they were too faded to read. One metal plate above the consoles had a short inscription etched in it, so it didn’t fade. The script consisted of vertical lines with dots, and triangles written on them at different heights, a bit like musical notes, but the sample size was too small to translate so linguists mostly ended up being useless for the whole stay. We tried to take DNA samples, but we got no results, which is unsurprising considering the age and conditions in which these bodies were kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the four months, we had submitted our reports. We didn’t make anymore significant findings and we couldn’t recover anything useful using remote subs we were using.
Some people, including myself wanted to continue, but the Navy didn’t want to talk about it. I suspect they have since recovered the wreck and moved it stateside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my stay there, one of the Navy liaisons told me they didn’t care if we talk about what we saw there. No one would believe us without a proof and the government’s own disinformation psyops would bury the truth in noise anyways. I haven’t told anybody about this, but I’m not worried about getting disappeared. I’m just sad I’ll probably never get any answers or credit. Recently I realised that since I wasn’t allowed to take any notes with me, I should write it all down before I start to forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask questions. I’ll try to answer, just keep in mind I was only a junior researcher there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pic related, just a quick sketch based off my memory. The actual wreck was not visible on cameras, due to the build up of sediment, but it stood out clearly on the sonar. Its rear end was covered by a sand dune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red rectangle is where we found the pressurised chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also clearly see remains of the crater it made during its crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anon 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks for the answer. I discounted oxidation&amp;hellip; well due to the lack of oxygen. Are you aware of what the atmosphere inside did contain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can remember, what did the engraving look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact inscription, but the symbols looked something like this. There were never more than 3 objects on a single line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/i-was-hired-by-us-navy-to-investigate-strange-wreck-in-the-north-sea/rect1.png&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overhead engraving consisted of ~40-50 signs. Most other labels were much shorter, more like single word vs sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the conditions it was pretty cold (ca 3°C), with atmosphere consisting overwhelmingly of nitrogen with some other gases including carbon monoxide. O2 was negligible. Since the bodies were so humanlike, I don&amp;rsquo;t think they could survive in such conditions. Most likely they were the result of malfunction of life support systems during the crash (maybe some leak etc). The temperature was likely just result of the depth at which the object rested, as it was pretty close to the surrounding water. No notable radiation. We also did microbiology tests to see if there are any weird bacteria floating in there, but nothing unusual came up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anon 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Weird proportions? Could that be explained by gas under pressure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By weird proportions I meant the female being huge and the two smaller bodies having atrophied bodies in relation to their heads. This was definitely an anatomical feature as it could observed in bones. I should also note that while impossible to say for certain, all bodies had broken bones that would suggest lethal injuries during the crash, so their deaths were most likely due to that and not change in pressure/atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anon 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Some questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the lady ayy hott? How big were the tits? Did anyone fuck the dead ayy(s)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a biologist so give us the biological detail of your report. Give us something that proves you&amp;rsquo;re not full of shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bodies were all so shrivelled up that she might have had the biggest juggs you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen and you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to tell. None of us was able to descend to the wreck in person, so best you could do is jerk off on a 1cm long piece of bone sample, which to my knowledge nobody attempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to tell sadly. My expertise is extremophilic invertebrates (which is why I have any interest in space related topics in the first place), so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to say about those humanoid bodies. I checked the samples we collected for mites and such and found nothing, but that&amp;rsquo;s hardly surprising. My biggest contribution was assisting in lab work and being the first to notice that the small corpses were mutilated, instead of just having fallen apart after death. We weren&amp;rsquo;t able to recover any viable DNA samples, but again this can be chalked up to age and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as my general knowledge of human anatomy goes, all three bodies were remarkably human, aside from weird proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anon 4:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;green-text&#34;&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it was probably just bleached from the passage of time though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Care to elaborate? My understanding is such a thing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen without UV being present?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways in which hair can change colour including oxidation or natural breakup of pigment over time. In our case there was no oxygen at the time we discovered the chamber, but I can&amp;rsquo;t say how conditions inside have changed over time. I mostly added that to pre-emptively react to replies about muh-nordics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anon 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Did the aliens have implants in their chests (pic related)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had implants throughout their whole bodies, but they were nowhere near as big and obvious. As already stated, initially we mistook them for metal debris from the crash, which got embedded inside the corpses. Most were no bigger than 3 cm and looked like metal shards.
The biggest implant was inside the female body. We didn&amp;rsquo;t take it out, but its shape and placement led us to believe it was an artificial kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeletons looked nothing like the Peruvian mummies. They were obviously humanlike with proper number of ribs, vertebrae, identical limb anatomy etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anon 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Why mutilated from the crash?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the estimated age/cash time even if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t get dating from samples etc?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, both of the smaller bodies have had their noses and ears removed. This happened long before their deaths and the crash as you could observe scars and marks left by stitching. Considering their closeness to human anatomy, this likely didn&amp;rsquo;t affect their functioning much and was done for cultural reasons. They were also both castrated. We were unable to tell their sex from the bodies alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the age, there were different numbers thrown around. Most convincing was one marine biologist who claimed that judging by the build up of sediment and organisms growing around the wreck, it must be at least 500 years old. No idea how close or far off he was considering many unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anon 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Were there microorganisms on board of the craft? Is the ship still there on the bottom of the sea? Did the ship have a control panel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran some bacterial cultures using samples from the pressurised chamber. Nothing worth mentioning. Hard to tell if what we found was natively there or if it was result of contamination during our excavation. No killer or unusual bacteria as far as I know.
The wreck might still be there, but my bet is that it was already removed by the navy. If I were to bet they wanted us to just confirm that it was dead and not dangerous before moving it to US.
There were plenty of control panels, each body was seated behind one. All were busted so all I saw were some buttons and (most likely) dead screens. Two smaller bodies were plugged into the panels directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but as you might be able to guess, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a sucker for any suggestion of the supernatural or extraordinary. As a kid I&amp;rsquo;d pour over Guinness World Record books until they fell apart at the spines, and I&amp;rsquo;d watch Ghost Adventures like an addict, believing every minute of it. It&amp;rsquo;s really interesting to think about what could possibly exist at the edge of our understanding, even if it means watching hours of Zak Bagans grasping at straws with a blinking music box. It&amp;rsquo;s this fascination that led me to the discovery that I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing here shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, these days I&amp;rsquo;m studying film editing at community college. It can be grueling sometimes, but I really enjoy it nonetheless. Last spring, I had an assignment to take some raw TV footage and cut it down into a smooth 15-minute runtime. All the footage comes from donations, so a lot of this stuff is old, mostly consisting of sitcom outtakes and the like. For my project, I started by digging through a big bin of VHS tapes; they take some time to transfer to mp4s, largely thanks to the school&amp;rsquo;s old tape player always breaking down, but I wanted to find something unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After picking through duds for about half an hour, I saw a tape near the bottom that caught my eye. It was labeled as an episode of &amp;ldquo;Eighth Wonders with Rocco Presley&amp;rdquo;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it, it was basically Ripley&amp;rsquo;s Believe it or Not in the format of a traveling talk-show. Despite its age, it was one of my favorite shows growing up. I used to know every episode by heart, which isn&amp;rsquo;t too impressive since it only had one full season, but the point still stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/future-tech/presleywiki.png&#34;  alt=&#34;PresleyWiki&#34;   title=&#34;The wikipedia documentation has a lot of this already covered for those of you who are unfamiliar with the show or its creators.&#34;  loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The wikipedia documentation has a lot of this already covered for those of you who are unfamiliar with the show or its creators.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I instantly dug the thing out and looked it over. The backside was scribbled with the phrase &amp;ldquo;Future Tech&amp;rdquo;, which didn&amp;rsquo;t bring anything to mind from what I could remember. I tried to temper my expectations, but I was thrilled with the prospect of seeing some long-lost footage from the unfinished Season 2. With the abrupt and gruesome end of the production, this was almost a sort of closure for me. I&amp;rsquo;ll get into all of that later, but I&amp;rsquo;m working in chronological order here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the tape running on my laptop, the window flicked to life with the light of a hanging lamp. The camera adjusted to its dim surroundings, revealing the scene of a basement filled with blinking servers, all surrounding a small CRT monitor. A small production crew was maneuvering in and out of frame around the cramped space, and Rocco Presley stood at the center fixing his tie. Within a few seconds, a clapper board came on screen, counting down from 3 before prompting Rocco to begin. I realized that this was, indeed, an unreleased segment, and from then on I was glued to the screen. Sure, I was supposed to be getting right to work, but you can&amp;rsquo;t blame me for getting distracted with something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nearly hour-long runtime, I can&amp;rsquo;t recall the whole thing word-for-word, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;ve got the opening monologue right. &amp;ldquo;Here we are at the center of it all; this unassuming basement room in Carlsbad, California is where Calvin Renner turned wires and switches into a groundbreaking artificial intelligence capable of feats previously thought to be mere science fiction, or so he claims&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s come in for a hands-on test and see what our PC technology expert thinks! Will he crack the hoax, or will he confirm an innovation of &lt;em&gt;virtually&lt;/em&gt; unmatched proportions!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocco walked back and took a seat at the monitor between two other middle-aged men, one of them portly with a wrinkled dress shirt and thin glasses, the other in a brown suit holding a gaunt face. I&amp;rsquo;d assume that other cameras were there to catch different angles, but Rocco covered the monitor from that view. The rounder one appeared to guide him on how to use the interface before he turned to face the other man and spoke again with his usual grin. &amp;ldquo;So, Professor Adams, what do you suggest we ask first?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They went about asking it a series of random questions, taking a jovial tone with it. The computer performed arithmetic, described the operations of household appliances, and even held a simple conversation with Rocco about a recent baseball game. It incorrectly said the Mariners scored 12 points instead of 8, but it was impressive nonetheless. The whole time Adams was talking with Calvin about its construction and programming, which had a few awkward pauses that could be expected from a pair of stereotypical tech nerds. The whole thing felt like a proper tech demo, except the tech was way ahead of its time. In the moment I wondered why this didn&amp;rsquo;t reach any markets in the 90s, but I found out soon after. It was about halfway through the tape when things got weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were just sitting there talking, when the computer began to emit a methodical beep. Not like a bomb or anything, it sounded more like a dial tone. The conversation died down and everyone looked at the monitor. Rocco was the first to speak up. &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s that noise mean?&amp;rdquo; For the first time, Calvin had no immediate answer. He just looked around at the machinery before stuttering &amp;ldquo;I-I don&amp;rsquo;t know, it just does that sometimes&amp;rdquo;. Rocco let out a bit of a chuckle. &amp;ldquo;Well you&amp;rsquo;re the one that built it right? Or did I just strike a chord with our mutual friend here?&amp;rdquo; Calvin, however, looked dead serious. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to have audio outputs.&amp;rdquo; Adams was already peering around at the servers. &amp;ldquo;Probably a system error then. It&amp;rsquo;s muggy down here, maybe something&amp;rsquo;s been overheating.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocco started to get up, but then the screen caught his attention. With him out of the way, the screen could be seen clearly. Instead of questions and answers it was displaying a grainy black and white picture. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell what it was, almost like one of those AI photos where you can&amp;rsquo;t identify anything. It looked like some kind of animal, and between the flickering from the camera, I swear I saw it move. Rocco caught a glance at it, and that was where his showmanship started to fall away. He paused for a moment, then he just said &amp;ldquo;what is that?&amp;rdquo; He turned to Calvin, but Calvin had no words. The only sound was the even tone in the background. He repeated, &amp;ldquo;Calvin, what is that?&amp;rdquo; He just stuttered under his breath, staring blankly at the monitor. The scene kicked up a bit with lights on all the servers blinking rapidly and Adams trying the keyboard to no avail. My attention was fixed on him until the monitor suddenly sparked and the screen blasted to pieces, sending Adams stumbling backwards clutching his face. The whole setup powered off and everyone jumped, including me. The shock lasted only for a moment, but it was replaced with a sickening horror when the contents spilled out. Instead of wires and circuit boards, the only thing that poured out of the screen was a thick blackish-brown liquid. The beeping had already stopped, so the room sat in a dead silence as everyone watched the oil-like liquid spill out onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Adams started receiving medical attention for cuts on his face and neck, Calvin tried to give an explanation, but Rocco cut him off. &amp;ldquo;Are you trying to pull something on us?&amp;rdquo; The whole room tensed up a bit. I&amp;rsquo;d never seen Rocco Presley do so much as raise an eyebrow before, so this was unreal. Calvin had already collapsed into a panic. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it would do that.&amp;rdquo; Rocco immediately fired back. &amp;ldquo;What, aren&amp;rsquo;t you supposed to be the expert?&amp;rdquo; Calvin was practically cowering in his chair, trying to calm him down to no effect. &amp;ldquo;Did you even make it? Huh?&amp;rdquo; Rocco berated him as he squeaked out the phrase, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know where it came from.&amp;rdquo; At that point some of the crew tried to intervene, but there was no stopping Rocco. He just kept shouting, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re sick, Calvin!&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that&amp;rsquo;s just what he was like off camera, but everyone seemed to be taken off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin got off his chair and tried to back away, but Rocco stood up in turn. Someone from the medical team tried to hold him back, but he shrugged them off, then shoved Calvin away. He must have slipped on the stuff from the computer, because he flew backwards and slammed his neck against the edge of the desk. Rocco was pacing around the room, yelling at him to get up, but Calvin was just lying there. Rocco started to cool down and shook him on the shoulder, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clearly remember the room going dead quiet again. Rocco&amp;rsquo;s face went from bright red to pale white in an instant. People rushed from Adams to check on Calvin while Rocco collapsed into a seat, looking like his soul had left his body. If the concern for Calvin didn&amp;rsquo;t shock him, the concern for his career certainly did. With the set in tatters and calls to cut being made, the footage froze up and flickered into static. Somehow I only then noticed the smoke pouring out of the tape player. I scrambled to turn the thing off, but it was way too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part that I&amp;rsquo;m still beating myself up about. I should&amp;rsquo;ve kept an eye on the tape player, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and now I&amp;rsquo;ve turned potential criminal evidence into a melted brick of plastic. I even had to explain myself to the fire department since the smoke detector went off. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I could tell them about what I saw, much less go to the police, so now you&amp;rsquo;re the ones that have to listen to me ramble about all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident sparked my curiosity more than anything else ever has, so I started digging. All reports suggest that the tape was recorded on August 22nd, 1991 during the main shoot for the segment. Calvin Renner was hospitalized with a broken back causing almost full paralysis, and the filming quietly went on pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only the next day when people started disappearing. Cameramen, editors, everyone on the set that day, they all left without a word and never came back. The missing persons count got higher with every headline I read. The families apparently begged police to investigate the Renner household, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything on him, especially considering he wasn&amp;rsquo;t even there at the time. Besides, none of the neighbors were reporting any disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By August 28th there was no one left, the same day the so-called Carlsbad Bloodbath hit the press, and all of this came to a close. Whatever happened between those two points is the cause of much speculation, as well as the focus of my search. Among all the news coverage, interviews, and tabloids, one clear narrative emerged; these people weren&amp;rsquo;t quite right even before they went missing. Everything I found before definitely felt off, but this is where it gets really weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start with an interview with the family of one of the mic operators. They said after the shoot, she became gradually more reclusive, eventually only leaving her study to eat once a day. Whenever asked about it, she just said she was having problems with work. She seemed sick, breathing heavily and breaking into coughing fits. Then she started talking about how she forgot something at the set, first in passing, then as a matter of urgency. It was three days after the shoot when she went missing. Later on, the photos of the operator&amp;rsquo;s personal sketchbook were released by her family, and there&amp;rsquo;s one drawing that caught my eye, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/future-tech/sketchbook-photo.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Sketchbook Photo&#34;   title=&#34;I can say with absolute certainty that this is an attempted recreation of what I saw on the screen.&#34;  loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;I can say with absolute certainty that this is an attempted recreation of what I saw on the screen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Renner, most folks chalk it up as mental conditions aggravated by his injury, but he became increasingly hysterical during his care, demanding to be released back to his house despite living alone and being paralyzed from the neck down. He was also noted to be having trouble breathing, which had no apparent connection to the injury. By the time the other shoe dropped and the big questions came to his door, he was completely unresponsive to anything outside his release. The cops couldn&amp;rsquo;t even discuss a deal for it; he was, quote, &amp;ldquo;mentally incapable of conversation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big break only came about 20 years later when the police released a series of messages left on his home phone, all coming personally from Rocco Presley. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this site takes audio files, so I&amp;rsquo;ll just paste the transcript here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transcript-of-recordings-of-telephone-messages-from-rocco-presley-davidson-from-august-23-1991-to-august-28-1991&#34;&gt;TRANSCRIPT OF RECORDINGS OF TELEPHONE MESSAGES FROM ROCCO &amp;ldquo;PRESLEY&amp;rdquo; DAVIDSON FROM AUGUST 23, 1991 TO AUGUST 28, 1991&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST 23, 1991 10:52 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; PRESLEY: (unintelligible) Mr. Renner? This is Rocco, uh Rocco Presley. (breathing) Now I bet I&amp;rsquo;m the last man you want to talk to right now, but I&amp;rsquo;m calling to apologize (short laughter) too little and too late, I get it, but listen, I-I don&amp;rsquo;t know what came over me last week. I mean I&amp;rsquo;m a public figure, so, obviously there&amp;rsquo;s all the issues there. If this got to the tabloids, I mean (breathing) that&amp;rsquo;s not just me on the hook, that&amp;rsquo;s the studio, the crew, everyone on the team. It&amp;rsquo;s on me to patch this up, and it makes sense if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear it, but you need to know that this affects a whole lot of folks besides me. There&amp;rsquo;s no words for how sorry I feel, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to reach out personally, not the suits back at the office. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fair to you. I just don&amp;rsquo;t know what happened, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to work it out with a shrink. I (unintelligible) really, truly, that&amp;rsquo;s not something I do, it&amp;rsquo;s not a representation of me. Listen I&amp;rsquo;ll just wrap this up here, but please, call me when you can, and we can work this out. (END OF MESSAGE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST 25, 1991 9:17 A.M.&lt;/strong&gt; PRESLEY: It&amp;rsquo;s Rocco again, I never heard back from you. I get it, man, I really do, but we&amp;rsquo;ve gotta do something about this. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the station breathing down my neck, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to sort this all out, for the sake of everyone on the team. I need an answer here, I haven&amp;rsquo;t slept a solid minute since the shoot. Honestly. (pause) Besides, uh, the crew needs more b-roll of the computer. I know that&amp;rsquo;s not the priority here, it&amp;rsquo;s just that they&amp;rsquo;re hounding me about it whenever I see them, and I tell them, &amp;ldquo;hey, we&amp;rsquo;ve got bigger problems so just work something out&amp;rdquo;, but they tell me, if we don&amp;rsquo;t get the footage, they&amp;rsquo;ll have to cut the whole thing. (laughter) I mean, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that just be the cherry on top of this whole sh_tshow. (breathing) I&amp;rsquo;m in your hands right now, and everyone else too. Whatever it takes, I need you to call me back. (END OF MESSAGE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST 26, 1991 1:13 A.M.&lt;/strong&gt; PRESLEY: Listen, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the news I want to be bringing up, but word is they&amp;rsquo;re gonna sue if you don&amp;rsquo;t let us get more footage. I know you don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk to me, but at this point you&amp;rsquo;re on the line too. Y-your discovery isn&amp;rsquo;t like anything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever found, I want the world to see it. Don&amp;rsquo;t you want that too? (unintelligible) Both our sakes, please just call me back, that&amp;rsquo;s all it takes. (breathing) We need to fix this, Calvin. (END OF MESSAGE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST 27, 1991 6:42 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; PRESLEY: Calvin, I can only hold the gates back for so long. (unintelligible) Trying to give you space but the studio&amp;rsquo;s had enough. We need more footage with the computer and you won&amp;rsquo;t let us get it. Hell, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know if you&amp;rsquo;re alive anymore, neither does anyone else I talk to. Do you want me to call the police, is that what you want Calvin? (breathing) I-I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do here, you&amp;rsquo;ve put me in a corner and now I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta act. If you can hear this, now&amp;rsquo;s your last chance to pick up the phone before I have to send someone to your door. (END OF MESSAGE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST 27, 1991 11:46 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; PRESLEY: (footsteps) You know what? F_ck it, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna talk this out one-on-one, no press, no crew, just you and me, us a-and (unintelligible). (breathing) This is all because of you Calvin, it all started when I used your stupid f_cking computer. (rustling) Can&amp;rsquo;t sleep, I can&amp;rsquo;t eat, I can&amp;rsquo;t THINK about anything outside of the basement. You did this to me, what happens next is on you, remember that. (END OF MESSAGE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUGUST 28, 1991 12:53 A.M.&lt;/strong&gt; PRESLEY: (engine noise, laughter) You know I lied, I lied to you Calvin. There&amp;rsquo;s no studio, no crew, no suits at the office. To tell you the truth I haven&amp;rsquo;t talked to them since the shoot. I haven&amp;rsquo;t talked to anyone! They keep calling and calling and I just don&amp;rsquo;t pick up! (laughter) I guess we&amp;rsquo;re the same like that, huh? (breathing) What did you expect me to do? You don&amp;rsquo;t talk to me, leave me to ROT with my own thoughts, lay back while I sit through this hell that you put me in. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the guilt or the stress, no-ho! (laughter) You know EXACTLY, what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. You knew from the start when you called my goddamn office. Me, Adams, everyone on the set! You did this to us, and for what? What do you get out of this? You&amp;rsquo;re sick, Calvin. You ruined us all, just for whatever perverted satisfaction this gives you. You won&amp;rsquo;t even let us see it again. You spent all this time keeping us from relief you know we need, but not anymore. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what, I can&amp;rsquo;t give you what you deserve, but I&amp;rsquo;ll sure as hell try. You&amp;rsquo;re about to see what happens to people like you. (END OF MESSAGE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police arrived at the house a few hours later, finding the scene that was later dubbed as the Carlsbad Bloodbath. The name comes from the rumor that the cramped basement held so much viscera that the floor was completely submerged in a shallow pool of blood, and from the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s credible; scattered among the servers and monitors were the remains of every person in the video, all mauled and disfigured like they&amp;rsquo;d been eaten alive. I knew I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have looked at the pictures, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the curiosity, and believe me when I say I regret it. Every photo is burned in my head; twelve innocent people, reduced to a mess of gore at the bottom of a basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all the bodies, Rocco was still alive, but he died on the way to the hospital. Given the autopsy photos, I&amp;rsquo;m shocked he made it that far; simply put, insides were outsides, everything below the waist was practically gone, and it took a solid minute to figure out where his face was supposed to be. Besides all that, police found a snub-nose revolver with his prints, but it was left halfway down the stairs to the basement. There was however a bullet hole in the ceiling, implying that he wanted to make his presence known. In fact, going over my notes, I think it was the gunshot that got the police to finally investigate the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forensics found that they&amp;rsquo;d all died at different times, with as much as a few days between some. Not just that, but bruising patterns proved that the victims were all alive for several hours as they were being mutilated, and there was no sign of a struggle. It was like they just laid down to die, taking a willing part in the whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: the autopsy revealed a &amp;ldquo;viscous substance&amp;rdquo; surrounding the brain and flowing down from it in excess, coating the throat and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I had to find out more, so I started looking into the aftermath. Apparently it took the local PD three days to make an official statement, and they couldn&amp;rsquo;t even provide a cause of death beyond the obvious physical trauma. Newspapers speculated about a possible cannibal serial killer on the loose, but there were never any similar deaths before or after to back it up. Besides, anyone who saw the autopsy can tell you no human could&amp;rsquo;ve physically done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think Calvin got away because he was stuck in the hospital, unfortunately no such luck. He was the only one who died somewhere other than the basement, but he was killed the same way: All torn up in his hospital bed like a wild animal had crawled through his second-story window, matching notes with the brain and lungs, and nobody heard a thing. Whatever killed these people, it was silent, smart, and capable of tracking its targets down when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the computer, it&amp;rsquo;s like it never existed; when Renner&amp;rsquo;s possessions went up for auction, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much as a mouse or keyboard on the list. Wherever it all went, there&amp;rsquo;s no public record of it. Then there was that phrase; &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know where it came from.&amp;rdquo; I can only assume he was referring to the monitor since, unlike traditional PC setups, it seemed to be the source of everything. Renner&amp;rsquo;s previous accreditations should have offered some clues as to how he got his hands on it, but that&amp;rsquo;s the thing; he had no previous accreditations. All I found was an associates degree in computer science and a short-lived tech support job at Fry&amp;rsquo;s. Our boy genius just came out of the blue, and instead of research institutes or newspapers, he reached out only to talk shows. It seems like his number one priority was to get his &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; on camera. Honestly nothing has fit quite right with this guy from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had more to share, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing else I can find. This is where all of you come in; I&amp;rsquo;m passing all of this information along to see if anyone knows any possible connections. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how tangential it seems, I need to see more. This case has been on my mind for months now, and I refuse to believe the trail ends here. I won&amp;rsquo;t stop looking, but for now, I have to take a break and try to get some sleep. The best I can do beyond that is organize my findings to show to others. Thank you all so much for reading; it&amp;rsquo;s such a relief to finally share this with more people.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was eighteen at the time. I&amp;rsquo;d just graduated high school, and what was probably a really exciting and memorable time for most people was a stressful race against time for me. You see, my dad was very traditional; if I were going to be living in his house after high school, even just over the summer between graduation and college, I needed a job. If not, I was &amp;ldquo;freeloading&amp;rdquo;, and he swore with an adamance I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t care to test that I&amp;rsquo;d be out on the street if I was unemployed for long. I&amp;rsquo;d had months of preparation; hell, years, really. This entire time I could&amp;rsquo;ve been looking; he certainly hadn&amp;rsquo;t waited until now to clue me in on the terms of living with him after high school. But I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t the type to care that much about anything until I was days from a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a job back then wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. I&amp;rsquo;d dyed my hair green, and my nose and lips were pierced, not to mention the gauges and the shitty stick and poke snake on my forearm that my sixteen-year-old self had afflicted upon me. Case in point, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting hired most places. And being that I had about a week at the time left to figure it all out, like usual, I was in a mad scramble to line something up before facing the consequences. But then, as if some morbid miracle, a cop got shot and killed on 84th Avenue pretty close to the Pass &amp;amp; Go out there, and an opening for the night shift position appeared not long after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pass &amp;amp; Go, and 84th Avenue as a whole, had a pretty bad reputation. See, 84th was one of the only roads in town still unpaved at parts, namely the north end shortly after the Pass &amp;amp; Go. And it wound along a pretty deep drainage ditch where no guardrails had ever been built, even after decades of complaints. There was a particularly tight bend up the road where a lot of drunk drivers and speeding teens learned that they were not in fact invincible, some of them even taking that lesson to the grave with them, and the lack of streetlights just made it all the more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those were just the logical concerns. In a tiny town like mine, people are bored enough to run with sensational bullshit, and so 84th could never just be a dangerous road with poor construction and lack of safety measures to blame, but was instead cursed and haunted. People died there so often not because it was just a hazardous roadway, but because it was bloodthirsty, evil. People&amp;rsquo;s reception went out on the road not because it was essentially the furthest you could be from town, but because some malicious entity wanted you isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woods beyond the ditch were even worse. On three occasions since the turn of the century, bodies were found out there, one a suicide, and two in shallow graves. And in a town as small as mine had been, that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty sizeable number. For a criminal, though, it only made sense to bury them there; again, this place was basically abandoned, and totally secluded. Really the only other people that far northwest of town were the wagies at the Pass &amp;amp; Go, and they weren&amp;rsquo;t getting paid enough to be on the lookout for anything. Not to mention, they had their own weirdness to deal with. All sorts of strange and illegal activities happened in that pothole-ridden parking lot, and why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it? That place was the last beacon of humanity&amp;rsquo;s presence in the town for miles, until you got to 90th Street, the main road shooting off from the highway. So anybody working there had enough going on at their own doorstep, and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be paying any attention to cars pulled off on the side of the road with mysteriously heavy duffle bags in the trunk. Suffice it to say, once the position opened, I was the only person in town out of options enough to drop off an application. And wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you know it, I was scheduled to start two days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked it up quick. The job was easy, and though at first I was shadowing a guy that by all accounts could have been undead, I was left to my own devices a week later. To be honest, I actually kind of liked the job at first. Ten p.m. to six a.m. were pretty standard hours of consciousness for me anyway, and working the graveyard shift finally gave me an excuse to sleep in until three. It was dead most nights; sometimes, and I&amp;rsquo;m not exaggerating, I literally didn&amp;rsquo;t see a single customer. And other nights, the goofiness of my interactions with various druggies kept things interesting. But those kinds of nights aren&amp;rsquo;t what this story is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I remember being pretty confused was only two weeks after I&amp;rsquo;d started the job. I was pretty stoned at the time, so I tensed up when I saw a cop walking toward the door, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t complacent enough to blaze it before work without eyedrops for fear of these exact situations, not so much worried about getting arrested, but about what my dad would do to me. I also had a little bit of a heads-up in the form of a faulty &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; sign in the window. The neon would pretty often flicker or dim for some reason when people were coming up to the door. Really couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you why it happened, but when I was totally fucking off behind the counter, it was my cue to act natural for a minute. And since a bunch of random bullshit was stacked up on the side of the counter to my left facing the parking lot and the pumps, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t ever see out the windows unless I was actively looking over it, so needless to say, whatever was wrong with that sign certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I was going to try and get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the cop walked in, I sort of leaned back as casually as possible, and tried to make small talk with him so his mind wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wander anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See any crazies?&amp;rdquo; I inquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not yet,&amp;rdquo; he answered, perusing the energy drinks like a selection of fine wines. He sounded pretty bored, and I hoped that that wasn&amp;rsquo;t an indication that he was looking for something to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well lucky you,&amp;rdquo; I chuckled. &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t say the same myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He settled on a sugar-free Monster. He walked over to the counter, and I remember thinking he was either a new guy or one of those officers that just never stopped being motivated, going off his short hair and fresh fade. Though judging off how young he looked, definitely early twenties, I was going with the former. These were the worst types of cops from my experience; they&amp;rsquo;re always looking for a way to stand out to their higherups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah,&amp;rdquo; I continued. &amp;ldquo;Saw a lady sleeping in a shopping cart out back. Asked her why the shopping cart and she said she learned from a TV show that you should never sleep on the bare ground. You learn something new every day,&amp;rdquo; I smirked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That actually happened last week, but who&amp;rsquo;s counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pfft,&amp;rdquo; he actually smiled slightly. &amp;ldquo;Weirdos, man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah. Will that be all?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;$3.29.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tapped his card on the reader, and while the sale processed, I remember actually feeling slightly concerned for the guy. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of cops, but one of them had died around here recently after all, and just talking with this guy face-to-face sort of humanized him to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he cupped the top of the drink and slid it off the counter, I said, &amp;ldquo;Stay safe out there.&amp;rdquo;
He glanced at me and raised an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know something I don&amp;rsquo;t?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nah. Just, you know. That cop that got shot out here a couple weeks ago.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just stared at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen,&amp;rdquo; he peered at my nametag for a second, &amp;ldquo;Carter, you can&amp;rsquo;t believe everything you hear about this place. 84th Avenue. It&amp;rsquo;s just a street, man. Most of what you hear about this place is embellished or even totally made-up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Uh, yeah, all right. Well, have a good night, Officer,&amp;rdquo; I paused, squinting at his nametag back. &amp;ldquo;Brady.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He walked off into the night, his energy drink in his hand. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t give that interaction a whole lot of thought. I learned most of my news from memes, and it was definitely possible I&amp;rsquo;d been wrong. Unlikely, but possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over time, stranger things began to occur. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about druggies sleeping in shopping carts. I began to pick up on an anomaly with the neon sign. See, it actually didn&amp;rsquo;t flicker very often. It seemed to at first, but after getting caught off guard multiple times by random people coming in, I realized I couldn&amp;rsquo;t trust it as much as I thought I could. Yet strangely, though it seemed inconsistent, I realized it always blinked and dimmed for certain people. There was this lady that would come in about once a week and buy a scratch-off ticket. I figured she had to be pretty depressed, cause she was always wearing the same clothes, and was coming to this dingy ass place with relative frequency. Every time she&amp;rsquo;d ask for the same ticket, Cash Keyser, and every time I&amp;rsquo;d slide it to her, she&amp;rsquo;d smile at me and say, &amp;ldquo;Maybe tonight&amp;rsquo;s the night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in her voice, I could hear how much she needed a break. But I guess tonight was never the night, cause a week or two later, she&amp;rsquo;d always be back, always dressed the same, always buying a colorful strip of false hope that things would suddenly change for her. I tried to chat with her the more she came in, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t keen on giving away details about her life. She was mostly unresponsive, just nodding or giving me one-word answers, and then she&amp;rsquo;d head out in kind of a hurry. But her clothes weren&amp;rsquo;t the only thing that stayed the same every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single time she came into the Pass &amp;amp; Go, that sign would flicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I could&amp;rsquo;ve just been reading into things too much. I wondered if the sign was ultimately connected to a wire through the ground maybe, and maybe certain people were stepping over it, and those people just kind of came in the same way every time. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know; I&amp;rsquo;m not an electrician. But the sort of Groundhog Day that transpired every time she stopped by really did intrigue me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one night in early July, I had another curious experience. I was listening to some podcast about ayahuasca and contemplating if I&amp;rsquo;d ever take the plunge when the green flicker of my inconsistent early-warning system caught my attention. And when my eyes trailed from the neon sign and over the merchandise on the counter to the pumps out in the dark beyond, I saw a guy pumping gas into his truck, probably in his mid-thirties. He had this really gruff look on his face, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have paid it much mind except for the fact someone was with him, a girl about my age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he was by the pump, she was heading into the store. She had black hair down to about her shoulders, and these big brown eyes. Her skin was kind of pale, like she probably didn&amp;rsquo;t get out much, and she wore skinny jeans and a grey top. As soon as I noticed her approaching, I stepped back from the window; I definitely didn&amp;rsquo;t want to creep her out by being seen peeking over the counter through the glass. She came in, and as the chime above the door rang, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but glance at her as she beelined to the snacks. She was cute, and I was considering flirting with her at first, but then I glanced over the counter again at the guy in the parking lot, presuming him to be her big brother or dad or something. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to piss him off, so I decided to keep it casual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was over by the coolers on the back wall the next time I found her, not looking my direction while she scanned our selection of sports drinks. Then she grabbed a red Gatorade and came walking up to the front. She put the drink and a bag of classic Lays on the counter, and when I noticed it was almost four in the morning, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but inquire, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s got you out so late?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was scanning the items with muscle memory, my eyes meeting hers after she glanced at the counter for a second as if considering a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nothing really.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Big bro?&amp;rdquo; I flicked my eyes to the guy in the parking lot, and at this, her nose wrinkled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eww. No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that was a strange response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eww?&amp;rdquo; I asked as the total popped up on the screen. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s gross to have a brother?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s gross to kiss your brother,&amp;rdquo; she smiled flatly, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to seem creepy, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but get on the tip of my toes for a second and peek at him again. No doubt the guy was in his thirties, and if I had to be more specific, I&amp;rsquo;d be leaning more toward late thirties than early. He was wearing boots, jeans, and a blue and brown flannel, and had a five o&amp;rsquo;clock shadow I could see from the store. The more I looked at him, the more weirded out I felt. But then again, none of this was my business, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pry. She definitely didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be with him against her will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ah, gotcha&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; I smiled, but the whole thing felt unignorably off to me as she handed me a ten. &amp;ldquo;You guys going on a road trip or something?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Something like that,&amp;rdquo; there was this turbulent mix of emotions in her eyes, and while she looked excited, definitely thrilled about something, she also kind of seemed to be longing too. I only got a glimpse of it though, as she unexpectedly asked, &amp;ldquo;You ever just do something totally crazy? Like, overnight?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I mean, I took a heroic dose of shrooms once on a whim without a trip sitter,&amp;rdquo; I smirked, and she chuckled too, but shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean something like that.&amp;rdquo; She paused. &amp;ldquo;Anyway, have a good rest of your night.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You too,&amp;rdquo; I remarked, but as she turned and walked away, I felt a steadily increasing urge to say something. To ask her why she was with this guy that looked like he could be her dad. To inquire more about this crazy, overnight thing she was hinting at, or this road trip-esque adventure she was on that had her at this infamous gas station at four in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was just too immature at the time, and selfish. Even feeling like I should probably investigate what was happening, probably pay more attention to what was going on, I also felt like I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered. I told myself that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my business, that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nosey, but really, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get involved. Though, a moment after she left the store, my curiosity got the better of me again and I peered over the cigarettes at the truck in the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was already inside, and at first, it looked pretty unassuming. It was old and kind of a faded red, with two-by-fours in the back under a blue tarp. All in all, nothing suspicious. But when he got to the turnoff onto 84th, and he took a right, I noticed the passenger-side window was broken, like it&amp;rsquo;d been punched out. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the girl well this far away, but her being in this older guy&amp;rsquo;s truck with the right window shattered made me feel even stranger about the whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was definitely off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the time, my lazy ass just didn&amp;rsquo;t care enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was mid-July, though, when the veneer of eccentric late-night patrons was shattered forever, and I was forced to see what was really going on. It began with a loud rumbling from the parking lot. I got immediately uncomfortable as some biker douche rolled up, revving his engine like if it were loud enough I&amp;rsquo;d give him a discount. Then he climbed off the bike and came stumbling toward the door, the green neon flickering onto him from the window. I could tell just from the counter that he was totally hammered; he could barely even make it inside. He came right to the counter, and absolutely reeked of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Give me a pack of menthols&amp;mdash;Camel,&amp;rdquo; he slurred, leaning onto the counter with his right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You okay, man?&amp;rdquo; I grabbed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The fuck do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hostility freaked me out just as much as it annoyed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re obviously drunk off your ass,&amp;rdquo; I replied. &amp;ldquo;You just drove here on a motorcycle. Seems like a bad idea.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shut the fuck up and sell me the cigarettes, man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was glaring at me like he was ready to swing. And though he was so fucked up I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt I could&amp;rsquo;ve taken him, he was still a big guy, and it really wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your funeral,&amp;rdquo; I muttered, grabbing the cigarettes and noting it was the last pack. Normally I would&amp;rsquo;ve made some quip about that, but with this guy, I just wanted him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I slid him the cigarettes, he flung his cash at me, and almost walked away without his change. Then he stumbled off back out the door, shoving it open so hard I wondered if he broke it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, without any warning, as he stumbled along the window toward his bike, his entire body changed. My breathing stifled as I noticed his head was dented in. Multiple of his teeth were missing, and blood ran down his face and soaked his jacket. He was covered from head-to-toe in cuts and scrapes, and his right arm was broken, the bone jutting out slightly. I stumbled back and tripped, knocking over the vape pens, then almost slipped on them as I scrambled to my feet and chased him out the door, staring in horrified bewilderment as he climbed onto a waterlogged motorcycle, the front of it totally wrecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; I screamed. &amp;ldquo;Man, are you all right?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He just looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as he stared into my eyes, his look was totally different than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t angry, or confrontational, or even drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He just had this totally sober look of regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stared at me a moment longer, then he revved his engine, and somehow he and his obliterated bike sped off into the night, leaving me totally alone in the flickering neon. And then as soon as he disappeared up the road, the sign stopped blinking, steadily shining like usual. I sprinted over to the doors, yanking them open and almost collapsing as I barreled into the backroom and landed in the seat at the computer. I pulled up the security camera footage and rewound it a couple minutes, desperate to see if somehow, some inconceivable way, I&amp;rsquo;d just been seeing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But though I was willing to believe he wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually injured and it was somehow all in my head, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at all prepared for the sight of me just talking to the empty air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy never even came in at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rewatched my harsh reaction to the absent revving of his engine, my eyes following nothing walking along the window to the door that never opened. Then I realized that I&amp;rsquo;d never actually grabbed the pack of menthols; my hand stopped over it, and handed nothing to no one. It was the same thing for the cash register. And then at last, I watched myself stumble back and fall, flinging shit everywhere in a panic. I ran out the door, screaming into the night, but only I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It filled me with a terror so paralyzing I almost just left right then and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there at the desk for a moment, shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was I hallucinating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d heard you can get permanent, schizophrenia-like psychosis from psilocybin, but this was the first, and only time, I&amp;rsquo;d ever hallucinated when not on the shit. And as I just stared at the monitor unblinkingly, shaking in place, I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell what was more horrific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really seen that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, my eyes gravitated to the one part of my memory that was corroborated by the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was dim, and as I unpaused the video, I watched it continue to flicker, all the way until my eyes turned to the end of 84th that I could see. And as soon as they did, it shined like normal again. I rewound the footage again, and sure enough, as soon as I began to react to the phantom motorcycle, the sign started flickering. It flickered the whole time, throughout that whole interaction, until the biker was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wasn&amp;rsquo;t crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something suggested there was more going on than me just losing my shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, what the hell had just happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t even go back to the front as I began racking my mind for all the other times the sign had flickered. And instantly, I recalled the scratch-off lady. I quickly Googled, &amp;ldquo;84th Avenue deaths&amp;rdquo;, thinking that maybe I could identify some of these people, but the first thing that came up was the police officer shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my jaw dropped as I stared into the memorialized eyes of Officer Brady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could barely sit still as his eyes looked back at me from the computer screen, the same officer I had spoken to just a month ago who didn&amp;rsquo;t know about any officer shootings in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because he was the officer that would be shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept looking, and before long, I found the scratch-off lady. She was some lonely, divorced woman that committed suicide in the woods a couple miles north of here in 2011. And the biker had crashed into the ditch right off the bend three years ago, one of many drunk drivers that didn&amp;rsquo;t react to the turn in time and went face-first into the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I screamed as the chime above the door sounded, and I heard someone spin around at the front of the store, startled by my reaction. I scrambled to my feet and walked up front, freezing as my eyes met those of Officer Brady&amp;rsquo;s, glinting in the flickering neon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You good?&amp;rdquo; he seemed to be both concerned and frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just stared at him, totally unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You on something?&amp;rdquo; he peered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at me a little longer, but then he walked his immortalized path through the gas station, his gaze drifting over the cooler of energy drinks. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but stare right at him, utterly wordless as he moved in almost the exact same way as he had back in June, at last grabbing that same sugar-free Monster. Then he walked to the counter, and my hands were shaking as I took the drink from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey,&amp;rdquo; he looked at me, &amp;ldquo;you all right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared into the eyes of the dead man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal stuff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is something going on? Looked like you were looking at the security camera footage when I came in,&amp;rdquo; he noted, and I listened in silence. &amp;ldquo;If someone&amp;rsquo;s prowling around here, I could investigate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to address what was really happening, to pick his mind and see if he was really unaware that he was dead, or if he was just haunting this place, and all of this was an act. Then I began to wonder if maybe this was some kind of time machine, if I could warn him about what was bound to happen to him and prevent him from dying in the first place. But as I recalled the biker&amp;rsquo;s corpse mounting his waterlogged Harley, I came to the conclusion that nothing I said to this visage of the officer was going to save his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I further waged, as soon as he walked out that door, he&amp;rsquo;d be a corpse too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You there?&amp;rdquo; he waved his hand in front of my face. &amp;ldquo;Talk to me, kid. You look like you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a ghost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m fine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slid him his drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You gonna&amp;rsquo; tell me the total&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s free tonight. On me. Have a good one, Officer Brady.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He blinked. He stood there for a moment as if considering investigating the gas station regardless of my cooperation, trying to get to the bottom of my unusual behavior. And maybe in life, he would have. But his fateful march to the street where his life would be taken from him seemed programmed to resume as he suddenly turned and walked out the door, just like he had the last time back in June, taking his energy drink with him. I followed him outside, standing beneath the fluctuating sign as my eyes fell onto the exit wounds in his back, the red streaks oozing from the holes in his uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I could cry at the sight of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked back inside, and had made my mind up to quit then and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote up a note and left it in the manager&amp;rsquo;s office, then I locked the place up and left the key under the propane cylinder exchange out front, about to text my morning relief where the key was when I froze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl, with black hair, and big brown eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neon sign that I had once thought of as my early-warning customer alert, and now understood to be some kind of paranormal detection radar, had flickered with her entrance too, just like it had for the biker, and the scratch-off lady, and Officer Brady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that moment, I became weirdly consumed with this desire to know what had happened to her. Maybe it was because I found her cute, or maybe it was because even in the moment that night, something felt horribly off. But for some reason or another, I became totally invested in figuring out what had happened to her, to the point that I decided to unlock the store and stick around. I went back to the computer, but for some reason, though I was able to find information about other people that had died in the area, some of whom I&amp;rsquo;d even seen walk into this gas station&amp;rsquo;s very doors in the middle of the night, I was completely unable to find her. And it really ate at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to the front at some point around five a.m., but still, I was just searching on my phone for the girl. Though by the time my relief came in at six a.m., I still hadn&amp;rsquo;t found shit. And that was my obsession for the next couple days. When I&amp;rsquo;d exhausted every article about deaths on 84th, I began to wonder if anyone even knew she was dead. So I searched local missing persons, and I looked into all of them, but still, none of them were this girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It haunted me for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began reliving as much of that night as I could, trying to recall every single detail. I could remember her hinting that the guy she was with was her boyfriend, which even then was a red flag, but now, as I remembered that older guy in the parking lot pumping gas in the dark, it filled me with dread. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get that good of a look at him; I could tell he had some stubble and was wearing a flannel, jeans, and boots, but what good was that? As for his truck, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure exactly what make or model it was, just that it was red and looked old. I could only assume the punched-out glass was like the biker&amp;rsquo;s motorcycle, something that had taken place after the girl&amp;rsquo;s death, or more likely during.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I remembered her asking me if I had ever done something crazy and overnight. And as I mulled over the words for hours, sitting on the back porch smoking a bowl as the sun set before my shift, I ruminated on all the possibilities such a vague statement could mean. But then, when I remembered her saying she was on something like a road trip, it started to click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy she was with, her &amp;ldquo;boyfriend&amp;rdquo;, must&amp;rsquo;ve been taking her off somewhere, probably far from her home. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;d been talking online, probably in secret, cause no parent would let their kid date a grown ass man like that, and she seemed to be about eighteen like myself. Maybe he&amp;rsquo;d driven to where she lived, and this big, crazy, overnight decision she made was climbing into this stranger&amp;rsquo;s vehicle that she&amp;rsquo;d been tricked into thinking was safe, driving with him for God knows how long as he took her to God knows where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then they stopped at the Pass &amp;amp; Go on 84th Avenue for gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, that part didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to me. Yeah, this place was a couple miles south of 90th Street, which came right off the highway, but why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t he stop for gas at one of the many gas stations out there closer to the interstate? Though, the more I thought about it, the more I started to piece it together. If this guy really was from out of state, and was trying to get her back to his place undetected, it made sense he didn&amp;rsquo;t pull right off the highway to the nearest gas station where cops could be combing through camera footage. Instead, he drove off to the most secluded road in the whole town: 84th Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had nothing to go off of to narrow my search really, and for all I knew, I&amp;rsquo;d have to look at missing persons listings for people in every surrounding state, and maybe even farther than that. I mean, it was just impossible. But at last, saying a prayer to whoever was listening, I typed in the vaguest string of clues I had: &amp;ldquo;Missing girl brown eyes black hair red truck&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I scrolled, and scrolled, and scrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched it first in various counties in Iowa; maybe she was just from a lower part of the state. But when that didn&amp;rsquo;t yield anything, I searched the same sentence with counties in Missouri at the end, and then Kansas, and then Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, after over an hour of looking, my heart skipped a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw those big brown eyes looking back at me through my cellphone screen. I clicked on the news article, and there, in her missing persons listing, was unmistakably the girl&amp;rsquo;s face, just like the one in the gas station. I immediately read the article, like it was some sort of divine revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her name was Amber Wicker. She would have just turned eighteen; in fact, her birthday was only two months ago, but her disappearance was four months ago, which meant that on the night that she&amp;rsquo;d actually stepped into the gas station and not the memory I had cohabitated, she was only seventeen, making the whole thing even more disturbing to me. She was last seen on her front door&amp;rsquo;s Ring camera climbing into a red truck parked across the street almost totally out of frame, but even in the glimpse of it available in the video, I could tell it was the same one when I saw the two-by-fours and blue tarp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stomach sank as I watched Amber hurry down the driveway, looking once over her shoulder to the safety of the house she was abandoning, then reaching the truck and climbing into the passenger seat before it took off up the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leaned back in the chair, letting out a beleaguered sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Amber Wicker was her name, and as far as the police knew, she was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I knew she was dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, every customer that had walked in beneath the flickering sign had been a corpse, and as much as I wanted to believe otherwise, I assumed her case wasn&amp;rsquo;t any different.
So as much as I wanted to stop working at that place, as much as it bothered me to see those ghosts walking the fated paths of their memories through the purgatory that was the Pass &amp;amp; Go off 84th Avenue, I had to stay. I had to wait until Amber came back, so I could gather enough evidence to give to police. After all, though some of the dead only came in once, like the biker, others had come in twice like Officer Brady, and even others had come in on almost a weekly basis like the scratch-off lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I hoped, she would come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, the rest of July, I picked up more night shifts, desperately wanting to be there the night she hopefully returned. I also chatted with Justin, the guy who I&amp;rsquo;d shadowed and who worked nights when I was off, but his brain seemed constantly fried on something, and if he&amp;rsquo;d had any paranormal experiences, he hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed. I asked him about the sign flickering and he said it did that on occasion, so I knew he&amp;rsquo;d seen at least some ghosts, but when I asked him about Amber, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if he&amp;rsquo;d seen her or not. Needless to say, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting anything useful out of him. I asked him to just keep his eyes open for her, and if he saw her, to note the license plate of the truck by the pump. You&amp;rsquo;d think such a strange request would raise an eyebrow, but he was so zombified on whatever the hell it was he was abusing in his off time that he just said, &amp;ldquo;sure&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks after I&amp;rsquo;d pinned down Amber&amp;rsquo;s true identity, I began to research her a bit. I could only find two articles about her; one was the one I first found, which just had the basic details of her disappearance, and the other was an even smaller article in which her parents had given a statement and a number to call if anyone knew anything. I really wanted to call that number. But I knew that right now, I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t have shit. I could always say I was at the gas station that night and saw something, but the security camera footage only went back sixty days, so there&amp;rsquo;d be no proof one way or the other. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a license plate, and I was a whole state over. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of faith the police would be able to do much with that, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give her parents false hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided I&amp;rsquo;d just wait until her memory replayed again, and I could piece together some actionable details. In the meantime, the more I searched her, I was at last able to find some of her socials, but her Instagram was private, and her Twitter was inactive for years. Though when I stumbled upon her Facebook, even though it, too, hadn&amp;rsquo;t had a post uploaded in two years, I felt strangely more connected to her as I scrolled through her photos, this immortal anthology of a dead girl&amp;rsquo;s time on Earth, floating in cyberspace for anyone to find and sharing her memories from before her life was prematurely snuffed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found pictures of her laughing with her friends, smiling at a dance, blowing out birthday candles. I saw random posts ranging from her excitedly proclaiming she&amp;rsquo;d gotten her learner&amp;rsquo;s permit, to complaining about failing some biology test. All these moments of this girl&amp;rsquo;s life, both significant and insignificant, were here forever, memories accessible to anyone that cared to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And really, her appearance at the gas station wasn&amp;rsquo;t much different. Though that memory was supernatural, unfolding in real time over a real place, it was, in essence, the same, just some moment of her existence that unaffiliated people such as myself were able to witness. Though whether or not I had been the one to see it for a reason, or my witnessing of it was just as inconsequential and random as me scrolling through her Facebook page, I felt that I was a part of this girl&amp;rsquo;s story now, and it was my duty to help her however I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by August, she still hadn&amp;rsquo;t come back. And strangely, neither had Officer Brady, or the biker, or even the scratch-off lady. There was only one other occurrence of the sign flickering, and I guess it was either a no-show ghost or a fuck you from the universe, cause no one ended up coming in. I got worried that whatever supernatural phenomenon had been taking place was over just as suddenly as it had begun, and that I&amp;rsquo;d never see her again, never be given a chance to atone for my apathetic complacency that night when I could&amp;rsquo;ve paid more attention to a situation that was obviously suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even worse, I was shipping off to college in just a couple of weeks; my remaining days at the Pass &amp;amp; Go were numbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on August 3rd, while sitting behind the counter in the dead of night, waiting for the purgatorial replay of an apparition&amp;rsquo;s final stop on the drive to her untimely death, I made up my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she didn&amp;rsquo;t come in tonight, then tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;d take matters into my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dawned on me that Amber must have died nearby here. The only ghosts that ever walked into this gas station were those that had died on 84th Avenue, and that was true for Officer Brady who had been shot just down the road, the biker who had crashed into the canal by the bend, the scratch-off lady who had hanged herself in the woods, and all the others I&amp;rsquo;d seen walk through those doors beneath the flickering green glow. And though I had no idea where to look, I had one thing to go off of: I&amp;rsquo;d seen the truck turn right at the turnoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So somewhere north of here, she must have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, just maybe, I could figure out where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By morning, I still hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen her, or any ghost for that matter, and after chatting with Teagan, my morning relief, I walked out to my car. But though I&amp;rsquo;d planned on driving home and getting some sleep, then searching later, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to look right then and there. And so, in my Pass &amp;amp; Go uniform and all, I walked over to the turnoff where I&amp;rsquo;d seen that phantom truck head right, and then did the same, walking north up the road.
The sun was just barely rising over the trees, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the last time I&amp;rsquo;d appreciated a sunrise. Usually, I sped home, trying to beat the sunlight to my room where I could shut my blackout curtains and crash as if it were still night, then I&amp;rsquo;d wake up at three or four in the afternoon. But this morning, moving slowly up the road along the canal and constantly scanning for anything out of the ordinary, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but enjoy the orange glow above the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I&amp;rsquo;d walked about two miles, the sun was fully above the horizon, and cars were starting to sparingly appear on 84th, though admittedly not many, as this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most direct route to anywhere in town except the Pass &amp;amp; Go. I&amp;rsquo;d already passed the infamous bend, and even felt obligated to pause there a moment before the canal, sort of waiting in reverent silence as I remembered the stare that biker had given me, the regret permeating his eyes. By now, though, it could no longer be considered a canal; it was a drainage ditch at best, a muddy, shallow dip off the road, and beyond it was the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, in my steady scan of the ground in front of me, I noticed something twinkling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crouched, looking down at small shards of glass on the pavement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost like a vision, my mind seemed to play out this simulation, and I was staring at the man as he and Amber argued. He lost his temper and slammed her head into the window, shattering it. I noticed more twinkling coming from the grass before the ditch, and I could almost hear the sound of his boots scraping the asphalt as he kicked the glass off down the hill, trying to cover up anything that had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed something yellow peeking out of the mud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped down into the ditch, grabbing the corner of the plastic and pulling it out of its muddy tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in my hand was a faded, dirty bag of Lays classic, mostly empty, with just a few crumbs at the bottom. My heart raced as I recalled her placing the bag on the counter, and again, I could see it before my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye, the man dragging her body out of the passenger seat, her deadweight foot scraping the bag out with her. He probably didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice in his panic as he dragged her toward the forest, the bag fluttering off down into the ditch below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked up the hill on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My breathing started to become heavy as I walked deeper into the trees, terrified as I anticipated just what nightmarish spectacle I might be about to find. But I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn back now. And as the afterimage of Amber&amp;rsquo;s conflicted eyes appeared in my mind again, I resolved to find where she was buried so I could finally give her parents peace, maybe even give her peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it didn&amp;rsquo;t take much more walking to find clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed two hardly visibly scrapes in the dirt, where her shoes must have been dragging. I carefully followed them, stepping off toward a cluster of trees as they suddenly turned, at last freezing before what I could immediately ascertain was a shallow grave. The grass all around it was undisturbed, but here, in just this plot, was a clump of uneven earth. Some grass and leaves had been precariously scattered on top in the man&amp;rsquo;s frantic attempt to conceal it, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as I crouched before the plot, my heart began to thump out of my chest. But I gulped and steeled myself, knowing I had to see this all the way through, for Amber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wished I had a shovel, but with nothing else, I just dug with my hands, scraping the dirt away and trying not to consider the possibility of my fingers abruptly touching her corpse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jerked as I felt something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like rotting flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I brushed the sand away, and my eyes centered upon a filthy blue tarp immured in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all I needed to see. I stayed right there, pulling out my phone and calling the police. And when they arrived within the hour, I told them I&amp;rsquo;d gone on a morning walk after getting off the graveyard shift, but noticed the broken glass and trash on the side of the road. They applauded me on my intuition, saying they probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have found that suspicious at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hell, I certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have either, if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t known the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I said I walked into the forest out of curiosity, but when I found what looked to be a trail left by dragging feet, I became convinced I&amp;rsquo;d actually found something serious. And after a little bit of digging where the ground looked abnormal, I&amp;rsquo;d seen the tarp and assumed the worst. They were kinder than cops had ever been with me as they thanked me, and in just a couple of days, it was confirmed in a news story that wrapped in that tarp and left to rot in the woods off 84th Avenue for the last half a year was none other than the body of Amber Wicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl with black hair and big brown eyes, taking her next big step in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last big step she&amp;rsquo;d ever take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad I had been able to help her family get some closure, and hell, even lead to the arrest of the bastard that killed her, whose DNA was recovered at the scene of the crime. But even still, at the end of the day, none of that would bring her back. I just felt hollow.
Finding her body, providing her parents whatever relief they could find, and putting that monster in jail, still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bring that innocent, naïve girl back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as I listened to a podcast on the graveyard shift on my last night of work at the Pass &amp;amp; Go, four days before I&amp;rsquo;d be heading off to college, I found myself constantly distracted thinking about that. But slowly, I got my mind off things, paying more attention to the podcast and starting to stare off into space at last, the shift beginning to fly by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until just after four in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gasped as the neon sign flickered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I darted over to the side of the counter and peered over the cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to describe the feeling in my chest at the sight of that old red truck. And though I felt ice in my veins at the afterimage of Amber&amp;rsquo;s killer pumping gas in the dark, when I found her walking to the front of the store, all that remained in my heart was an overwhelming longing, an inconsolable despair. She walked into the store, the chime on the ceiling ringing as she headed right over to the snacks. I stared at her undamaged body, her clean black hair, her innocent, big brown eyes. I became emotional at the sight of it, trying desperately not to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She grabbed the bag of Lays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she walked over to the sports drinks, and I leaned against the counter, my chin in my palm as I gazed at this specter retracing the final moments of her life, none the wiser to the horrible demise awaiting her two miles away. She grabbed a red Gatorade, then walked over to me, and I felt breathless as she approached, unsure of what I&amp;rsquo;d even say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoa, you all right?&amp;rdquo; she looked at me, and I must&amp;rsquo;ve been hiding how I felt even worse than I realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m fine,&amp;rdquo; I lied, scanning the items like a robot. I cleared my throat. &amp;ldquo;What brings you out here this late?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nothing really.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total came up on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Big brother?&amp;rdquo; I limply asked, nudging my head toward the heartless man in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eww. No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s gross to have a brother?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must&amp;rsquo;ve asked the question differently this time, cause she stared deeper at me, asking again, &amp;ldquo;You sure you&amp;rsquo;re okay, dude?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, I wanted so badly to tell her to run. To just get the fuck out of here, to not ever go near that man again. I wanted to tell her that she was about to die, that he was her murderer, that these were the very final minutes of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was not a time machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was no different than that Facebook page from years ago, just a memory inexplicably suspended in time, just a brief expression of her existence that was as ephemeral an experience as her time on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can I ask you something?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She raised an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you ever done something totally crazy? Just overnight?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She blinked wildly, visibly taken aback by the words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, actually,&amp;rdquo; she murmured. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I have. Why do you ask?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No reason.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What about you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I did, once. I, uh, I had this weird inkling to follow a trail into the woods. And I found a body. Called the police and reported it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Creepy,&amp;rdquo; she remarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let out a long sigh, handing her the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, this is on me tonight. All right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, uh, sure. How come?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You just look like a friend of mine,&amp;rdquo; I smiled hollowly. &amp;ldquo;A friend I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in a while. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s my treat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, all right. Um, thanks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took her unceremonious last meal, then turned over to the door, walking toward the oscillating neon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have a good rest of your night, Carter,&amp;rdquo; she glanced at my nametag, smiling slightly at me.
It broke my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You too, Amber.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I said you too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stood there a moment, as if debating whether or not she&amp;rsquo;d heard me right the first time. Then she turned around and walked outside. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just sit there, and before I knew it, I was running around the counter, shoving the doors open and stepping outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bit my tongue at the gash on the back of her head, the blood dripping down her hair and onto the back of her top. I had guessed that that had been the cause of her death, but evidently, I was wrong. Because as she turned back toward me, I found her blue face, and the purplish bruising of a seatbelt around her neck. Her clothes were covered in dirt and blood, and the Lays bag was empty and faded, mud clumped all over it. The bottle of Gatorade was halfway empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trembled as I found her teary gaze, the desperation and regret staining her painfully cognizant big brown eyes, not innocent anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you,&amp;rdquo; she whispered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly muster a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Amber turned, the afterimage of her corpse climbing into the passenger-side door of her murderer&amp;rsquo;s truck. I remained frozen in place, my eyes following every last fleeting second of Amber&amp;rsquo;s existence as the taillights glowed, and the engine hummed. Then the truck pulled off, pausing at the turnoff. And then, as it pulled away, turning right on 84th Avenue and heading to her shallow grave, the neon of the sign stopped flickering, leaving me standing there alone again in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/dead-mall/sleepypines-768x768.png&#34;  alt=&#34;sleepypines-768x768.png&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was called Sleepy Pines Mall. A few miles off an interstate in America’s northeast, at the center of several small towns. It was a single story and only had two anchor stores, but it was sprawling considering its almost rural location. Built in 1973, it was one of the older shopping malls, and opened before there were long-term strategies on mall viability. Popular for a time, its occupancy dwindled in the late ’90s, and it lost its movie theater and Sears by 2003 before becoming a neglected, poorly maintained, and sometimes dangerous commercial plaza that was outdone by nearby rivals, and doomed by surrounding negative growth trends of the towns that kept it fed. The food court closed in 2006, and the last stores followed a year later. Sleepy Pines had its fans and grown adults who had gone there as children paying it nostalgic visits, as all malls do, but by 2010, it had become a mostly-forgotten derelict with a parking lot full of weeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, a lengthy demolition was in its final stages. I had been assigned the foreman of the construction of the building that would replace it: a large warehouse and distribution center for a major retailer. I would frequently pay the site a visit as the walls were torn down and the roof was gutted, myself having gone to the mall several times in my youth whenever my family was passing through the area—so I knew its layout well. By the winter of 2020, all that really remained of the structure was the back wall of its atrium, which once overlooked the fountain. A painted mural on tiles covered that wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to save the artwork delayed its destruction several times, but enough funds were never procured to bring the wishes of perhaps only a few dozen to fruition. I’m no critic, but I always found it rather creepy, anyway. European settlers amid a backdrop of pine trees, with the Natives they drove out now instead depicted as their friends. Their faces were plain and simple, their eyes staring off into a space where there was once a skylight. On the other hand, the trees looked like they were made by a different painter, and one more talented. The pines were muted in their colors, but highly detailed, with layers of darkness in their shadows where you might expect mischievous forest creatures to reside. The swirling, intricate patterns of the nearly-black paint took the forms of deranged beasts if looked at closely enough. But I think it was just the artist having fun, and not acting out with ill-intent. It wasn’t like the vast majority of the shoppers would stand around and study the mural closely, not when there were sales to be found and warm pretzels to be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the mural itself would be coming down soon, and ground on the next building would be broken after the spring thaw. What little demolition remained was also put on hold while the earth was still frozen. I went to the site a few days after New Year’s, to get my last look at the public painting, exposed to the elements and surrounded by a landscape of snow. I checked in on the operations trailer while there, just to give my best wishes for 2021 to the guy in charge, who I had gotten to know over the years from various other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, you still like strange shit, right?” he asked me after a few minutes of us chatting about our holiday get-togethers. “Got something you’ll love. My guys found it just before they left for the winter. I’m no good with electronics, you know. So you might as well see what you can do with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He handed me a GoPro camera, an earlier model that I would later learn was from 2013. The little box was in bad condition. But I didn’t take into consideration &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; bad at first. And it was true, I did collect oddities and yard sale objects with inexplicable back stories in my spare time. It wasn’t the camera itself that might rival some of my greatest finds—it was the potential of the footage onboard it, if it survived. If it could explain &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the poor thing had been beaten into such bad shape, then the story of the object would be made all the better. I had a long winter ahead of me with little else to do, so I figured I could spend a few nights cracking it open and seeing what was on its memory card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus,” I replied as I studied it in my hand. “It’s like it… melted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. We dug it up and couldn’t tell what it was at first. I have no idea if there was some kind of fire here, but it doesn’t even look like burn damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made a good point. There was no sign of smoke, no bubbles in the material, no metal fatigue. It was like something had turned it into clay and had its way with misshaping it into a twisted piece of art. The glass of its LCD screen and lens was intact, but the body was warped, stretched, and compressed as if by tiny fingers. If the memory card was still in one piece, I would never be able to pry it out. I’d have to carefully crack open the camera around it. Of course, I had a big collection of tools at home, so I knew I could do it. There was every chance the card was missing, or corrupted, or the data had been deleted, but now I was interested. I wanted to find out for certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told my friend that we should have lunch sometime, and headed home. I was making good money, but I got to keep the house after the divorce and had yet to get around to moving out and finding a better place. It was a small place, and half of it was spread across cardboard boxes or otherwise just a neglected mess. My home office was the only decent room remaining, and it also featured my tool bench and the arsenal I would use to disassemble the scarred and malformed lump that used to be a high-tech recording device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to break it open and separate several of its pieces, and eventually the Micro SD card fell out from its slot. It was perfectly readable and full of video files, which I transferred to my computer and organized by date. There were 23 in all, most recorded over the course of two days in December 2013. With a cold, quiet winter outside my window, I turned up the heat, brewed some coffee, and went through the files, knowing nothing about the camera’s owner or what they experienced when I began. I will summarize the portions that are more mundane or uneventful, and fully transcribe the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-1&#34;&gt;File #1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded on a chilly morning, with the operator obviously testing camera settings outside their house. No address can be seen, and the surroundings are typical suburbia, making the location difficult to identify. There is snow on the ground. It starts with the operator saying “nice” as they zoom out on their new camera’s now-empty box. They’re inside their messy car, and they focus on the house for several seconds before the video ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-2&#34;&gt;File #2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file created date indicates that this one was recorded just a couple hours later. A young woman, around 30, is watching a pot boil on a stove. She’s a small brunette with a bubbly attitude and big, blue eyes. I quickly discern that this is the operator’s girlfriend; they’re both happy and energetic, like they have their whole lives ahead of them. Definitely not married, and they’ve probably only been together a few months. I learn both of their names as the young man teases her a bit with the camera, and she remarks that she hopes he didn’t spend too much on the new toy. I’m not going to share their real names, so let’s just call them Mike and Jenna. They clearly really like each other, and the clip ends after he tells her, “This is a lot better than the old one. The mall videos are going to look great.” Jenna stirs some stovetop sauce and smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-3&#34;&gt;File #3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike records some football in the yard at another house. Even though the clip was made only a week after the previous, there’s no snow present. In fact, everyone is running around in t-shirts, making it obvious that this was filmed much further south, away from cold weather. It’s a Thanksgiving gathering, and Mike is filming his three younger cousins toss around the old pigskin outside, trying his hand at some “sporty” action shots. It keeps going for about ten minutes, and friendly banter is shared among the family members. The cousins seem to like Mike, even as he keeps denying their requests to join in. At the end, Jenna walks out of the front door and tells everyone that the meal is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike and Jenna visit a local mall in the area on Black Friday. It’s large, with two floors, and doing well. The place is packed, and Mike gets a few minutes of the mall Santa and the line of kids waiting to see them. Jenna looks at the camera and smiles again. Mike comments that he hasn’t been to a mall this busy in years. It definitely makes me nostalgic for the pre-pandemic days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-5&#34;&gt;File #5&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike is seen on video for the first time at the mall, ten minutes later. Jenna gets in some framing practice. Mike tries to humor her with grandiose gestures, like he’s introducing the place to an adoring, large audience. He says some things about the mall, but the crowds drown him out. The camera isn’t really known for its audio recording quality. This lasts several minutes as Jenna gets used to the device and how to hold it steady. Towards the end, she recommends getting some sort of mount for it, which it was designed to be used with. Mike agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-6&#34;&gt;File #6&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things begin to get interesting. It’s now December 15, and Jenna is doing another camera test around sunset. Mike is seen crossing the frame several times as he moves about and she pans the camera. They’re getting footage of the front of Sleepy Pines Mall, which has just recently closed. Snow covers the neglected parking lot. Mike tries the door and looks frustrated that it’s locked. I hear the agitated version of his voice, as he remarks that they “should’ve come yesterday, now it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna assures him that there must still be some way in, that someone had forgotten to lock one of the many doors. I understand now that they’re urban explorers of some kind—though they likely just kept things easy and focus on malls. Judging by Mike’s response about that “not being a good idea,” I figure that they hadn’t broken into a place before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recheck the closure date of Sleepy Pines, which was December 14. They had just missed their chance to legally or easily get inside and film a dead mall. Mike sounds ready to give up, mentioning how well their previous trip went to another mall in the region, and that they are “never going to get their subscriber count up at this rate.” Jenna isn’t so despondent. She wants to make her guy happy, and she mentions that since it took an hour to get out here, they should at least try to get in. Mike sighs, nods, and smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-7&#34;&gt;File #7&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shot a half-hour later, and it’s now dark. Jenna is holding the camera, getting a selfie of both of them. They’re under a buzzing wall light somewhere on the side of the mall, near a cracked-open service door. They both look pleased, but it’s clear that they’re still amateurs at the newest hobby they want to do together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, guys! It’s Mike and Jenna,” she says with awkward grin. “Um, so, we’re here at Sleepy Pines Mall, and we’re going to explore it together. If you’ve watched our first five videos, you know that we’re both interested in this sort of thing. We’re just going to go in for a quick look tonight, and then come back tomorrow during the day. I bet it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; creepy in there right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All right, let’s do it,” Mike adds and side-steps inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He opens the door and beckons in the viewer, while Jenna snaps the camera into a shoulder mount. The service corridor is poorly lit, and the 2013 hardware doesn’t have the sensor chip to shoot in darkness very well. Digital noise fills the frame as they navigate their way into the mall proper, stumbling over some equipment, boxes, and cleaning materials that had yet to be removed from the area. Commentary is nearly non-existent until they find another door and emerge into a side hallway that brings them to the atrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the mall’s lights are still going, although the mural is bathed in shadow, giving its already creepy staring faces an ominous presence in the nearly empty building. For several minutes, the couple of explorers walk around, getting footage of the vacated stores. They reach the other end of the mall and head back to where they began, saying very little as they collect footage. The clip ends with a ten-second hold on the mural, during which Mike can be heard laughing after Jenna remarks, “yeah, that’s a little scary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-8&#34;&gt;File #8&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two definitely don’t have a script. As they perform a longer second walkthrough, they chat idly about how they feel about the place and experiences from past visits to other malls, just to fill dead air. Jenna is at least a competent cinematographer, even if her boyfriend leaves much to be desired in the information and anecdote side of things. If they weren’t planning to add some interesting voiceover narration in post, they would have two very dull videos on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s around the five-minute mark in this clip, while Jenna shows off the closed dollar theater, that Mike finally mentions some personal history. I learn that he used to live in the area as a kid, and has fond memories of visiting Sleepy Pines, back when it had busy weekends and few closed stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of my earliest memories were of coming here with my dad when I was five,” he tells Jenna. “So it must’ve been around 1991? I met Santa, right over there.” He points to wide-open liminal space under a skylight in the center of the mall. “It’s sad what happens to these places, how the memories fade over time, you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is that why you were so mad when you found out you missed its last day?” Jenna asks, now keeping him in frame like they’re having an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shrugs. “I paid a visit a year ago when it was already deep into the shitter. It would’ve just been symbolic or something. We’re both here now, right?” He pauses and looks away. “You ready to go? We can get more footage tomorrow, during the day. We just have to keep that door from locking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Place is starting to get to me. Empty malls at night are unnatural.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They turn around and head towards the hallway where they came in. On the way, Jenna suddenly stops and swings the camera around. She stares into a lightless corridor, so dark that the sensor can’t pick up anything. A posted sign indicates that the mall security center is at the end of the hall. She lingers on it for an unusual amount of time, and Mike asks off-screen what she’s looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you hear that?” she asks, nervousness in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turn up the volume as much as I can, but nothing strange passes through my headphones. If she’s hearing something, the camera didn’t pick it up. She looks into that corridor, as if more petrified by fright than curious. In the end, it takes Mike dragging her away to break her focus, at which point she seems to snap out of it. The clip ends with Mike staring at her and asking “what’s wrong?” If she gives him an answer, she does so when the camera’s off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I get onto YouTube and search for their names. Adding “mall” into the search form on a second try brings me to their page. They really were just getting their start; their channel only has six subscribers, five videos with only a dozen views each, and no uploads for over seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skim through their videos, all visits to other malls, and find nothing out of the ordinary. Their most recent upload started showing the signs of professionalism, with some of that voiceover narration they badly needed. Mike shares some history of the empty mall in another state they visited, and he does so with some enthusiasm. He and Jenna smile throughout their trip and look like they’re having a good time walking through a shopping plaza of memories. They were one of YouTube’s earlier dead mall channels, and they had some promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seeing their inactivity only all but confirms my worries that something bad had happened to them. And a few minutes of Googling later, I find out they had been reported missing in early January 2014, at least a full two weeks after they started working on their ill-fated video. Naturally, I get the urge to skip to the end to find out what may have happened to them, but I convince myself to keep going through the files in order and take this trip with them as their latest expedition’s first viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a second look at the last few minutes of this file, I notice two pink pixels in random spots of the video. I know it’s a sign of sensor damage, and I trace it back to when Jenna focused the camera into the dark hallway. After thirty seconds, one dead pixel shows up. A little later, the next arrives. It’s as if there’s something at the end of that corridor that is emitting a damaging, invisible light or other energetic phenomena which steadily overloads the camera sensor. But I don’t know what else could do such a thing, other than a powerful laser, or radiation. Eagerly, I move onto the next clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-9&#34;&gt;File #9&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dead pixels are here to stay. They’re present throughout the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see Sleepy Pines’ exterior again, this time early in the morning. Mike stands at the side entrance, his breath filling the cold air. He gives Jenna a thumbs-up, and she comes over and points the camera at the both of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m Mike.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And I’m Jenna.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then add in unison, “And today, we’re exploring Sleepy Pines Mall!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They proceed inside, and arrive at the atrium without cutting the shot, even when there’s no reason to keep things all in one take. But Mike must have done some research while at whatever hotel the two stayed at the night prior, as he starts going over the basic details of the mall. Its opening date and designer, a brief history of the area, a few controversies about its construction and maintenance record, and the stores that have come and gone—all get a mention, though not in a scripted way. Mike has all this stuff memorized and jumps from one bullet point to the next. Still, I’ll give some props to the guy for remembering so much and getting it all out on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did we get it that time?” he asks when they return to the atrium, where the fountain still hosts some coins and is half-full of stagnant water. He smiles after Jeanna quietly responds and adds, “Okay, keep that one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, not &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; their first try. I don’t know how many attempts it took, since they must have kept deleting prior takes to keep memory space free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Jenna stops recording, Mike wanders around a little, looking into empty stores. Eventually he suddenly notices that the red light remains on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You still rolling?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike, I think we should check out the security area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighs and looks a little annoyed. “You &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; care about that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on, we’ve seen just about everything else. We should get &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; on film before they tear this place down, or there will be rooms that are, you know, forgotten forever. Never archived.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need to be &lt;em&gt;perfectionists&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But you went on and on last night about visits here with your family and friends, your memories of the holiday decorations and seeing dollar movies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt;, Jenna? You’re saying all this on camera? At least shut it off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shot lingers a few moments longer, before Mike looks fed up and starts approaching the camera. He’s about to grab it when the clip ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess every relationship has arguments, but it’s a strange thing to have a fight about. It almost sounds like Jenna felt something was “calling” to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-10&#34;&gt;File #10&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike now stands in front of the dark hallway, although now with the sunlight coming in through the nearby skylight, it’s no longer pitch-black. Mike looks like he’s under just a little bit of duress. But I understand, knowing myself that sometimes you just have to do what your significant other wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All right, so… let’s take a &lt;em&gt;quick&lt;/em&gt; look down this hallway,” he says, lacking his typical enthusiasm. “It’ll be a place you probably only saw if you tried to shoplift something or, you know, &lt;em&gt;filmed without permission&lt;/em&gt; like only criminal scum would do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike!” Jenna exclaims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fakes a smile and says, “Let’s check it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera has already acquired a third dead pixel before they even start moving into the hallway. More pop up as they get closer as the sensor becomes more and more permanently damaged. But with the camera on her shoulder and Mike leading the way, Jenna doesn’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It quickly becomes too dark for it to pick anything up again, but Mike turns on his phone’s flashlight, which at least helps it show anything that within its cone of light. They enter the security office and freeze for several seconds, an old desk and monitoring station in frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that?” Mike asks. “Do you hear that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. Some sort of electrical buzzing,” Jenna answers. “Weird, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the &lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt;, Jenna? Why are even checking this place out? One of us is going to get electrocuted. Can we please get out of—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, okay. I thought there would be more to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turns around to leave, but then looks back at Mike again after realizing he isn’t moving. He’s staring into a small room to the side. His light is on a sign that reads, “Lost and Found”. Now he’s the one that seems to be under a spell and just has to know what’s beyond the next door. Without saying anything, he opens it and goes inside, and Jenna silently follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is… difficult to describe. The video goes almost completely dark. For some reason, Jenna doesn’t point the camera to whatever Mike is looking at until the end of this clip. His phone light is only seen at the very edge of the frame. They both examine what is evidently a strange object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is that thing?” Jenna asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No idea… Never seen anything like it…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, god, it’s almost like it’s… moving. Mike, don’t!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s warm. How’d this get here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stop touching that thing, it’s dangerous!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no such thing as a cursed object, Jen. I think we should get this thing out into the light and get a better look at… Oh, shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What did you do? Mike, what’s it doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know, I didn’t—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They turn and run out of the room, but the camera still can’t pick up anything they might be hearing. The two are frantic and the video, what little there is to see, becomes a shaky mess. By now, scattered pink pixels partially cover the video, completely obscuring entire small segments of the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two can be heard screaming in the last few seconds of the clip, which ends abruptly. With the darkness, I have no idea what kind of terror the two might have experienced. I would have thought they were already dead if this had been the last file on the card—or, at best, someone else found the camera and recorded more video before they also mysteriously disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the clip frame by frame reveals two elements that just barely got burned into the digital film. As they turn to run, Mike’s light sweeps over the strange object they came upon. It’s some sort of totem, made out of unknown dark material and maybe about three feet high. It sits in the middle of the lost and found room, on the floor, and is the only thing in the place at all. It’s covered in carvings that form angular patterns—though I use the term loosely, because there is no real pattern to the lines at all. They swirl and break off from one another in random, unappealing ways. It’s like one of those AI generated images that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; looks like something familiar and identifiable, but is never quite anything that really exists. Even so, it didn’t look entirely alien, or forged by some forgotten tribe. It could’ve been someone’s art piece, found at a garage sale many decades ago, its history and origins now long obscured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the strange totem wasn’t the sight I found &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Mike and Jenna saw them before his phone light suddenly cut off, leaving them in darkness. I can’t confirm whether or not they’re moving or just writhing in place, but on the walls of the security room is a spreading sea of long, solid black worms. I don’t know how else to describe the things, but it’s obvious in the few frames I get of them that they’re no trick of the light or other optical illusion. Worms, molding over the wall, like they’re devouring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After re-watching the entire clip several times, I close the video and try to wrap my head around what I just saw. I almost dread finding out what happens next, and I delay myself from opening the next file by refilling my coffee. It’s around midnight when I move on, to a recording made three hours after the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-11&#34;&gt;File #11&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open the file with no expectations, and it right away defies explanation. While the smattering of dead pixels lingers, it’s as if the past trauma the couple just experienced isn’t a thought in their minds. And at first, it’s like they’ve gone to another location—and put on some new clothes. Or rather, &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; clothes, because it looks like Mike pulled a wardrobe out of the late 80s and changed inside of a brightly-lit dressing room. All in the span of a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike stands smiling, though he has a nervous twitch. It’s apparent in Jenna’s camerawork as well, because her shot now has a constant tremble. The device is also no longer mounted, judging by the shakiness of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“H-hi, guys,” Mike says after taking a deep breath. “&lt;em&gt;Well,&lt;/em&gt; you’re never going to believe what happened to us. If we get out of this…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;,” Jenna replies, though there’s no confidence in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right. R-right… Um, it’ll be better if just show you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gestures to a mirror in the dressing room, and Jenna walks up to it to show herself in the reflection. She now looks sharp in a bold red blazer and Capri pants, and her hair is fancifully styled up in a way that would take hours to achieve. But it’s the camera itself that’s even stranger. Holding it with two nervous hands, she brings it close to the mirror, and… it’s no longer a GoPro. It’s not even a digital device anymore. It’s now somehow a classic Polaroid, one of those old instant cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, weird, right?” Mike continues. “It doesn’t have a screen on the back anymore, but it has buttons, a-and… all of the on-screen information is &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the viewfinder. I don’t know why, or how, but our clothes changed, too. It’s like… I don’t even know how to say it. Oh, man. We’re going to get &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of views, baby. We’re going to be on &lt;em&gt;talk shows&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;scientists&lt;/em&gt; will want to—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike! Can we please just get out of here? It’s… It’s too confining.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All right. Yeah. Let’s keep showing them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two leave the dressing room and step out into a fully-lit, packed Dillard’s department store, just like the one Sleepy Pines used to have. But I hadn’t seen one so busy in many years. And as Mike and Jenna keep pretty quiet and give a tour of the place, I steadily realize why it seems so off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like their clothes, those on all of the shoppers and staff, and those waiting to be worn on the racks and shelves… Everything is dated. It’s all fashion from around thirty years ago. Mike at one point even grabs a polo shirt and, with a stupid smile on his face, brings its price tag right up to the camera, remarking about how it’s so cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you get it yet?” he asks the viewer. “I mean, it should be obvious what happened to us, right? We didn’t believe it ourselves at first, but—oh, sorry, man,” he tells an older shopper he had bumped into, who only responds by turning around and giving Mike a curious look. “Come on, let’s see the mall. We haven’t left this store yet… Needed some time to get over the shock first. I wish we had gotten some of that recorded. Jenna was &lt;em&gt;crying&lt;/em&gt;, all hysterical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike!” she replies disdainfully. “You’re taking all this way too lightly. How can you &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be terrified of what’s happening to us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He frowns and admits, “A part of me is, baby. But we can’t explore this place while only being scared and worried. We can at least get it all on record, in case something happens to us and the camera is all that’s found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t say shit like that, Mike! None of this is normal!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, come on. I’m right here, I’m with you. We’ll get out of this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna begins to cry, and the camera points down at the floor. Mike can be heard saying, “Let’s talk—” just before the clip ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go directly to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-12&#34;&gt;File #12&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a few minutes later. The camera is now pointed toward the main thoroughfare of Sleepy Pines, past the Dillard’s entrance. The shot lasts for about thirty seconds, during which dozens of shoppers walk by, many of them wordlessly glancing at the camera for a moment. Mike then walks into frame and guides Jenna out into the mall, though her movements show she’s still reluctant. I pull myself and my chair closer to my monitor and watch intently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear something familiar and nostalgic come through on my headphones. I turn on the noise-cancelling so I that I feel even more engrossed by what I’m experiencing. Mike doesn’t even know what to say about the enormity of the situation as they approach their exit. I hadn’t given myself time to process the previous clip, or how the look of the store could have been pulled off through some elaborate set dressing. The obvious but incredible answer to all of this still had yet to feel like a valid thought in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike isn’t the only one startled when a large woman suddenly enters the frame. One second, it felt like we had been exploring uncharted territory together, and the next, there’s a big lady in a pantsuit threatening to spray him with a bottle of amber-colored perfume in a crystal bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I told you, we don’t need a sample, lady!” Mike snaps at her. “Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, but this is our new fall scent! There’s nothing else like it on the market! Just one whiff, and you two will fall in love all over again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seems aggressive, and she keeps trying to spray Jenna and Mike as they shove their way past her. For about a second, her unsettling toothy smile fills up the frame as the camera itself nearly smacks into her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the hell’s her problem?” Jenna asks once they’re in the safety of the mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They could be like that,” Mike sighs and looks up at the skylights. “Just maybe not as bad, from what I remember. Crazy bitch. You okay? She didn’t spray you, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Michael, &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is this place?” Jenna asks and points the camera at the ceiling, revealing the blue sky beyond the horizontal panes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera settles back on Mike, and for several seconds, he grins in a way that’s almost as unsettling as the perfume lady’s smile. I can hear the tinny, echoing music better as Jenna waits for her boyfriend to say something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s genuine, traditional Muzak. Those light co-opted renditions of pop music that went out of style years ago that’s barely heard anywhere anymore. Somehow fittingly, as Mike grins like an idiot, Toto’s &lt;em&gt;Africa&lt;/em&gt; fills the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you really going to make me say it?” Mike asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be some other explanation. This all can’t be real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Babe, we’re in the &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt;! We found some sort of time-traveling device, I’m telling you!” He turns about and soaks in the mall, adding, “My guess, 1990, maybe ’91. All of those 1980s styles are on the way out, and everything is so colorful. I’m talking post-Cold War chic, Jen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then why did our clothes change? Why did the &lt;em&gt;camera&lt;/em&gt; change? Where did our phones go? We need to make sure there’s a way out, or a way to go back, before we start trying to have fun. I don’t want to be trapped here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not here to have fun. We’re here to make history, maybe even be a part of history. We’re &lt;em&gt;filming&lt;/em&gt; the past, babe. We’ll document everything we see, and then we’ll find that weird thing again and figure out how it can send us back to 2013. But we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; stay a while, right? I mean, this decade is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better than the one we came from, with all that social media shit and dumbass ‘challenges.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish you wouldn’t say that. Our friends and family are there, Michael. Our future together. We can’t stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike sighs. He doesn’t want another argument; he wants to explore what he thinks is the past, some small piece of his own childhood. The shot lasts another few seconds on his impatient face before the camera pans down. I get a look at Jenna’s shoes to see that they’ve turned into a pair of red high-tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-13&#34;&gt;File #13&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clip goes on for over ten minutes, and it’s a proper mall tour. Jenna quietly films every store they pass without argument, while Mike tries to provide some commentary. But he’s often distracted, overwhelmed by amazement every time he looks into a shop, or sees a person walk by in nostalgic clothing, or finds a treasured piece of media from the era. He forces Jenna to spend several minutes just in Sam Goody, so she can get every audio cassette, early CD, or video tape in at least a few frames of video. All the while, Mike is overly excited and Jenna seems wary of the crowds. The shoppers almost approach an uncanny valley. They &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like regular people, but they act like emotional automatons, staring vapidly at the two like they are intruders in their home. She notices them, as do I, but Mike hardly seems to consider whether or not something is off with everyone other than himself and his girlfriend. He’s under the effects of a siren call brought about by his love for a romanticized past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They pass by a brightly-lit hair salon with colorful geometric shapes on the walls and a checkerboard floor. The three women seated inside are all getting the exact same hairstyle. The small movie theater’s marquee lists as now playing: &lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gremlins 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;City Slickers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Rocketeer&lt;/em&gt;, and, ironically, &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future Part III&lt;/em&gt;. We see more mall store staples, many of which no longer exist anywhere. A KB Toys, a Walden Books, a Merry-Go-Round filled with clothes for teenagers. I recognize most of the places, and sure, I miss seeing them if I think about it, but they all had their time, and I don’t worship the past like Mike seems to. While it’s certainly interesting to see all of these old stores in modern high-definition, dead pixels aside, I find myself just hoping the two make it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleepy Pines looks very different overall. It has big blue, red, and yellow painted lines running along its wall. Neon lights cast their glow on indoor trees and lounge areas full of boxy chairs and couches. Coin-operated rides sit out front of the arcade, for the kids too young to venture in and play the cabinets that bright and noisy pixelated games inhabit. I can empathize with Mike, being a kid during this snapshot in time, wanting to go back and feel something genuine again if he believes the present is shallow and hopeless. But that idealism isn’t going to find either of these young adults a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the while, the calm cheerfulness of the mall music undercuts the rising dread I begin to feel about a situation I’m helpless to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wow,” Mike says wistfully as they reach the Sears at the other end of the mall. “It’s… It’s great, Jen. What an experience. You got all that, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes. Now can we go back to the lost and found? We need to get that thing to send us back home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wonder if the younger me will show up if we wait around… Baby, I don’t think you appreciate all of this enough. How often do you get to take your girlfriend to the &lt;em&gt;freaking past&lt;/em&gt; and show them someplace that meant so much to you?” After waiting for a response from her that doesn’t come, he sighs, nods, and says, “All right, fine. Let’s get a good shot of the mural on the way back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They head to the mall atrium, where Jenna lets the mural fill the frame. It’s incomplete, and even creepier for it. Two-thirds of the forest segment is done, but the five figures standing in front of it have yet to be painted, and are just a solid ghostly white. I didn’t know that the whole thing wasn’t finished all at once. It suggests that there might be something to my idea that the poorly-drawn pioneers and natives were added by a second artist. Maybe even just as an excuse to cover something up on the original background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s weird as hell,” Mike says as he looks at the artwork. “We must’ve been brought back to one of the few days when the mural was still being made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna grumbles and starts to pressure him to focus on getting themselves home, but is interrupted when mall security comes over and reminds the pair that they can’t just shoot pictures in the mall without permission—unaware that their mutated camera is actually filming video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sure, no problem,” Mike is heard saying after the camera goes to Jenna’s side and is pointed at the floor. “Hey, can we check your lost and found? We think we, uh, left something behind when we last—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clip ends, as abruptly as I’ve come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-14&#34;&gt;File #14&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next file was created four hours later. I’m seriously concerned about what might have happened in the time in between before I open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike and Jenna are staring at the camera together. They’re back in one of the Dillard’s changing rooms, where they might feel safe. The light flickers above them, and now they both look noticeably stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, guys…” Mike tries to find the words and wraps an arm around Jenna’s shoulder. “Um, so… Here’s the part where we have to tell you that things aren’t looking good for us. I still don’t know how or why we’re in the past, and we can’t find the thing that brought us here. We’ve looked all over. Every store, every back room, every staff room you could think of… And it feels weird trying to sneak around, you know? The people here are always looking at us. And I don’t think any of &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; have left, either. They’re all the same shoppers that were here when we arrived. Something is wrong with this place. I should’ve seen it earlier, but I was busy being too stupid about everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The doors out are all locked,” Jenna adds tearfully as she seems to come to terms with their situation. “We tried all of them, and t-they won’t budge. We picked up one of the pay phones, but there’s not even a dial tone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to tear this place apart if we have to. We’ll find that thing, whatever it is. But just in case we don’t make it out, and you find these videos, please call my parents. Their home number is…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike, shh,” Jenna suddenly shushes him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She points towards the edge of the frame, and Mike turns the camera around to show the gap at the bottom of the changing room door. After several seconds, a pair of large feet stuffed into high heels steps into the space. They turn towards the door, and it rattles violently. Jenna can be heard suppressing a scream. The door keeps shaking for about a full minute, before the assault on it finally ends. Without saying a thing, the large woman on the other side walks off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As upset as she is, Jenna picks up the camera again, nearly dropping it as she films Mike cracking open the door and looking around. He gestures for her to come out, and they make an exit from the store by sneaking behind clothes racks and keeping quiet. The other shoppers look at them again, but don’t bother them. Just before they can leave, Mike gets a shot of the perfume lady standing near the store entrance. I recognize the shoes and realize that she must be stalking the pair at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without warning, she turns toward them, and they duck behind a display table full of polo shirts. I pause on a frame of her face and see how hideous she has become. Her bulbous face is covered in bright red lipstick, sky blue eye shadow, and bright pink blush, but it all does nothing to help with the fact that she has greasy, disheveled hair and yellow, crooked teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few seconds, the camera pops back up. The perfume lady is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where is she?” Jenna whispers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know… We just have to get out of the store. We never should’ve come back in here. We &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; the door would be locked, just like the others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike, we have to—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna is cut off by the sound of ruffling fabric. She and Mike both flip around to see the perfume lady staring right at them from the top of a clothes rack. She’s slumped over some of those chrome bars, her blob-like arms dangling down like she’s an obese sloth with a murderous glint in its eye. She curls her lips into a demented grin and holds up the perfume bottle seemingly glued to one of her hands. Mike and Jenna quickly work up the nerve to get on their feet and make a run for the store entrance. Judging by the sounds coming from behind them, their pursuer knocks over the entire rack and crashes into more displays as she gives chase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are expletives, terror, and panic in Jenna’s voice as she and Mike dash out towards the mall. She briefly turns the camera back to capture the crazed lady on film. She’s become animalistic, running on all fours with eyes as black as a shark’s. Jenna lets out a shriek as the feral beast gains on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the perfume lady stops right at the boundary of the store, as if there is an invisible barrier she can’t pass. After catch his breath, Mike flips her off, and the woman simply regains her composure, getting back on two legs and returning to the cosmetic department, that grin never leaving her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the hell, Mike? She’s not &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;. No person acts like that,” Jenna shouts at him. “We need to get out of this place, &lt;em&gt;right god damn now&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know, Jen, I know! At least she still can’t leave the store. Shit!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike tries to calm himself down as the shoppers stare at him, most of them now just standing around as if they’re NPCs who have run out of walk-cycles. He points the camera up at the skylight, revealing that it’s dusk. The neon lights of the mall now determine the colors, splashing everything in hues of reds, purples, pinks, and blues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also hear that the Muzak has slowed down and become distorted, like a talking electronic toy with low batteries. The audio seems to unnerve Mike, who closes his eyes to think but can’t get comfortable enough to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like this place is starting to fall apart,” he mutters out the same thought that had just crossed my mind. “Jen, we need to find something heavy. Hammers, crowbars, maybe just a trash can. We’ll smash our way out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He proceeds to shove his way past the crowd of zombie-like onlookers, yelling at them to get out of his way all the while. Jenna follows at a distance, getting a face full of their staring eyes on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They briefly stop near a display of a red 1990s Corvette, where a nearby small film crew seems to be trying to make a commercial. Hot lamps hit the sweating face of an older man in a gray suit. He repeats the line, “A lot is happening at Sleepy Pines Mall. Why not come see what’s new today?” several times as Jenna also films the scene. Mike then loses his patience and enters the shot, but the attempt at making a commercial continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve been here for &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt;,” Mike tells the crew angrily. “Who are you people? How did you get in here? What ad agency do you work for?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Michael, stop,” Jenna quietly pleads. “Don’t antagonize them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re not even real. They’re mindless, running on some kind of script.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no concern for consequences, Mike knocks over the lights, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the expensive film camera, and then steals the tripod. Jenna doesn’t know what to make of it, and she just stands in place in shock as Mike walks away with the bulky piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, actually, Mike seems to have a point, because the actor simply keeps repeating the same segment of the commercial several more times with the crew watching and going through the motions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera pans down to the floor and the clip ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-15&#34;&gt;File #15&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with Mike midway through another swing of the tripod against a glass door. He’s been at it for a while, based on his apparent exhaustion. He lands the heavy, metallic tripod plate against the glass several times, but he has yet to crack it. The glass doesn’t even seem to have any give to it; he might as well be hitting a brick wall. The vintage cars and trucks in the parking lot outside &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; real, but I’m not sure. There are no people outside in the darkness, yet the couple are trapped in the mall with hundreds of them, so everything beyond its walls may not even have reason to exist. Whatever time travel trickery is going on, it likely can’t extend past the building in which it was triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna can be heard quietly sobbing. She pans to a trash can on the floor, knocked over, and she gives it a kick, giving me the impression that she had used it to join in the effort before she gave up and started filming again. I also notice that the Muzak is now completely gone, replaced by a monotone buzzing sound. Mike hits the door twelve times in all, working up a sweat and eventually hopelessly collapsing to the floor. The recording of his effort then ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-16&#34;&gt;File #16&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera sits on a table in the food court. It’s getting late, but it looks like all of the places are still open. The pair have cups of soda and slices of pizza on paper plates in front of them, but they both look hesitant to eat. It isn’t that they’re only losing hope of escape—they’re also &lt;em&gt;afraid&lt;/em&gt; of the food. I can’t blame them. They’re also mostly in shadow, now lit only by the neon lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are we really going to eat this?” Mike asks listlessly. “I mean… who knows what it’s made of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna murmurs back, “We have to eat something. We’re starving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike looks into the camera and says tiredly, “Yeah, so… The clocks here say it’s two in the morning. And things just keep on going. It’s a 24/7 mall now, I guess. We couldn’t last much longer without eating or drinking something. If this is what ends us, at least you’ll know it wasn’t the perfume lady…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the few acts of bravery I’ve seen Mike exhibit across the videos, he takes a sip from the cup before Jenna—slowly at first, before gulping it down thirstily. She then does the same with her drink, and they soon look a little more confident about trying something solid next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, it &lt;em&gt;tastes&lt;/em&gt; like Dr. Pepper,” Mike says and examines his pizza. “And it looks authentic enough. Even though I don’t think much of anything is &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; in this place. Okay… before it gets cold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes a bite, chews, and eventually swallows. Deciding it tastes edible enough and is worth the risk, he quickly gobbles up the rest, while Jenna remains more reluctant and takes her time with her food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s too dark in here,” she says, looking around. “All of the ceiling lights shut off hours ago. But the people didn’t even seem to notice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ll try to get some sleep in the arcade,” Mike tells her. “All of the games are still running… I think that’s the most light we’ll get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s going to happen to this place?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe… eventually, the dream ends and we wake up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even the guy at the Sbarro didn’t speak, or ask us for any money…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah.” Mike then deadpans a joke, “No wonder the chain is dying off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sit, drink, and eat quietly for another minute before the video ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-17&#34;&gt;File #17&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one takes place entirely inside the mall’s old arcade, which closed in 1998. The only sources of light are the flickering cabinet screens of games on their demonstration modes, but there are so many that the place remains the brightest locale of the mall at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike holds the camera this time, but I don’t know what he’s trying to archive, other than the miserable conditions the two have found themselves in. He makes a few rounds around the arcade cabinets, muttering incoherently to himself. Kids and teenagers fill the large room with a carpet featuring planets and stars, but none of them move. Some have their hands on joysticks or buttons; others just stand and stare with arms at their sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike tries to illicit a response from one of the kids, getting the lens right up into their face. Their eyes are glazed over, looking straight ahead as the light of a fighting game reflects off their large pupils. They’re just as catatonic as everyone else. Mike throws a swear at him, before going over to the prize counter and getting a shot of all the toys he’ll never be able to claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to a good university,” he tells his audience of one, and turns the camera on himself so he can speak angrily directly into it. “I had a good job lined up. And I liked the 1980s, the ’90s. So what? Doesn’t mean I want to be stuck in some shitty bizarro version of nostalgia. I never want to visit a mall again. And the camera battery… It should’ve died a long time ago. But the icon says it’s still full. Nothing is right. It’s all wrong. We’re never getting out of here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still filming, he goes over to one of those large cabinets that you can sit down inside of for some privacy and immersion. It’s an old racing game with a steering wheel, and Jenna is curled up on the seat, facing the wall, sleeping or trying to. As this file was created five hours after the previous, I get the feeling that Mike couldn’t sleep, or gave up trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decides to let Jenna be and slumps down onto the carpet. Several cabinet screens are in frame, the kids in front of them now lifeless silhouettes. Mike can be heard getting emotional for a few minutes, over the noises of the games. Suddenly, he hears a loud metal clang outside, echoing down the mall’s corridor. He jolts up and points the camera at the darkness outside that only the neon lights can penetrate. His breathing is shallow and rapid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing shows up, at least that he can see, but he still ends up running into a small utility closet—without alerting his girlfriend to a possible danger—and closes the door. Following another few seconds of a pure black image filled with digital noise and dead pixels, the video ends. I assume he eventually fell asleep in that cramped space, and that the experience was beginning to wear on his sanity by this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-18&#34;&gt;File #18&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera is aimed up at one of the skylights, where early morning light is coming through. It’s possibly about 8:00 AM or so, meaning Mike and Jenna are nearing twenty-fours spent in the mall. Mike pans down to show the mural and the fountain in front of it, where Jenna scoops up a handful of water and washes her face. Around her are the mindless shoppers, all of them still idle despite the fact that the place seems to have never opened or closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version of Sleepy Pines, whether it really existed in the past or not, just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve come to realize that it represents the memory of a mall, when people are there to remember it. Times where it is empty and dormant don’t factor into this corrupt amalgam of its golden days of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speakers are still pushing out some sort of noise, but now all I can hear are atonal crackles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike approaches Jenna, leaning forward and staring at her reflection in the fountain. She looks at him as he draws near, now looking incapable of ever smiling again. I still worry about Mike’s mental state, but she doesn’t seem afraid of him. She’s just tired, or starting to resign herself to their imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jen, are you hungry?” Mike asks flatly. “The Cinnabon still seems to be running. I could get you… something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shakes her head and replies, “Mike, we need to find a way out today. Whatever it takes. We can’t give up… We just can’t…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know. We’ll try something else. I was thinking maybe the air vents…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna looks like she’s about to say something, but instead goes back to looking into the fountain. After several seconds, she takes on an inquisitive expression and leans forward. She stays in frame, but I get the impression that Mike’s actually looking elsewhere while the camera remains pointing at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna takes out one of the coins from the fountain and studies it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can barely hear her murmur, “Michael… Look at this…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike doesn’t hear her, and shouts, “Jen! Run!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera swings around, and I see the perfume lady aggressively approaching at a fast and unstoppable walking pace, the Dillard’s far behind her. It’s the first time we’ve seen her leave the invisible boundary of the department store, and Mike and Jenna seem shocked about this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large woman still has a perfume bottle in one hand, but there’s no telling what she really wants. Not ready to find out, the couple start running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-19&#34;&gt;File #19&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour after the previous video ended, Jenna gets the camera going again to show Mike crouching down between some washing machines and peeking around the corner of one of the big white cubes. They’re somewhere in the Sears store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think we finally lost her,” Mike sighs and slumps against the machine. “Crazy &lt;em&gt;bitch&lt;/em&gt;. Why is &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; the only one still moving around?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shakes his head and looks up to see that the camera is recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike…” Jenna says quietly. “There might be a way out, or… &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grumbles back, “What are you talking about?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t get your hopes up, but… I found a… Here, just look.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hands him a quarter, and he checks both sides of it. He looks at Jenna like she’s crazy at first, but then realizes why she sees it as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s got state art on the tails side… That didn’t start until around 2000.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, it’s from 2005. I don’t think the coins in the fountain were affected by any of this. Something to do with the water, maybe?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That doesn’t make any sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of this does. But maybe there’s something we can do with water. Whatever took us to this bizarre version of the past… Maybe water is the answer, a way out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike frowns. “So, what? Should we jump into the fountain, hold our breaths, and hope for the best? Or do you want to open up all the faucets in the mall and flood it? How does this big revelation &lt;em&gt;help us&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to keep trying, Michael! And we need to talk. We need to understand what happened to us, and what this place really is, and why we’re here. I don’t think we’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; in the past. Didn’t you notice how early it got dark yesterday? There aren’t any holiday decorations here, and all the fake people are dressed like it’s summer, but the day didn’t last any longer than it did before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean… Yeah, I guess…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that device somehow &lt;em&gt;recreated&lt;/em&gt; local history, by altering all the nearby material. But it isn’t perfect, and it can’t sustain it for long. It’s not stable—it’s all breaking down, and we’re running out of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s &lt;em&gt;insane&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have any better theories? Do you think we &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; went to the past?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike takes on a rather vapid expression as he thinks for a few moments, before replying, “Then what’s the deal with the perfume lady?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. Maybe she’s guarding the place. Maybe she’s the thing keeping us here. She’s &lt;em&gt;hunting&lt;/em&gt; us, she’s a threat, so I say… let’s just try to kill her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How?” he asks, and rather stupidly in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could start by &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt;. Why don’t we bash her over the head and see what happens? She’s not real, Mike. None of those people are real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All right, yeah, fine. We’ll smash her head in and see what comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tries to act tough for his girlfriend, but he can’t back it up. After he agrees to commit some form of homicide, the two hear a noise, and he panics just as much as she does when they see the silhouette of the perfume lady against the light of the Sears’ exit to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure whether she was just standing there looking menacing, or started chasing them again; the clip ends just as the couple start running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-20&#34;&gt;File #20&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only four files left to view, I know that Mike and Jenna’s journey is coming to an end. This one opens with Mike holding the camera at himself, and behind him are boxes of shoes—he’s at a Payless or a Footlocker. He has his free arm wrapped around the camera tripod from earlier, which rests against his shoulder. He must consider it the best weapon he could find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We think it’s been over twenty-four hours since all this started,” he tells me. “We’re prepared to take on that perfume bitch now, mentally and physically. But we don’t know where she is at the moment… But you gotta see this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gets up and goes to the store entrance, where Jenna is standing guard and looking into the hall. She’s holding a metal bar in one hand, I think taken from a clothes rack, and a fire extinguisher in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look at them,” she murmurs. “They’re getting worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike gets a little closer to one of the nearby kids, but still keeps a safe distance. Thick black ooze, moving as slowly as hot tar, is dripping out of the boy’s mouth. Smaller streams of the stuff come out of his lifeless eyes. Mike pulls back and pans the camera to reveal that the surrounding adults are suffering from the same affliction. Still, they all do nothing but stand quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna walks into the frame and says, “This is what I’m talking about, Mike. This place is falling apart. First, it’ll be the more complex things, like the people. Then the rest of it will follow. The whole building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But not us, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna doesn’t have an answer, but there is doubt in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They move away from the store, Jenna ready to strike with her crowbar. Everyone they pass is disintegrating from the inside out, but none of them act aggressively, or move in the slightest. Mike points the camera up to the skylights, where a miasma of black specks is rising and beginning to smother sunlight. As he pans back down, he catches on film one of the shoppers losing their arm. It simply breaks off and falls onto the floor, where it slowly melts into a pool of black liquid. At this point, they’re out of expletives and just accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the movie theater’s marquee has been corrupted, or is “glitching” like a crashing computer program. The only two legible titles are &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;, neither of which came out anywhere near the supposed emulated time period in which the two are trapped. The other spots on the marquee are jumbles of letters and numbers, and a pile of them is building up on the floor by the box office. Mike turns away and focuses on the fountain they’re closing in on. The mural behind it has lost all its elements and is now a solid black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna runs over to the water and looks down into it. She dips a hand in, and then steps in fully, submerging herself to just below her knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You really expect something to happen?” Mike asks as he catches up. “You’re just getting soaked. Might be hard running in wet, squishy shoes, Jen…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe we won’t have to run anymore if this is our way out.” She looks down at her feet and mutters, “Come on… Do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you hoping will happen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. Maybe for my shoes to change back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike gazes into the fountain, bringing the camera close to its surface. He notices the coins, and takes one out to look at the year it was minted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You were right,” he admits. “You’ve been putting more thought into all of this than I have. I guess anything’s worth a shot at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He points the camera straight up for about a full minute, leaving a bit of his hair in the frame as the clouds of dark particles thickens above. After he has some time to think his deep thoughts, he swings it back down and gets a shot of Jenna’s shoes again. They’re still red high-tops, and she expresses her disappointment with apparent anguish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how long she stayed in the fountain, since the video ends a moment later, with Mike trying to be considerate and offering assuring words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-21&#34;&gt;File #21&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over two hours later, Mike gives me a shot of the skylight again—only now, the dark particles are burning away into a thick mist that almost fully obscures the sunlight. It moves like boiling water, forming a wriggling cloud all across the top half of Sleepy Pines. The writhing mass reminds me of the worms crawling on the wall from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse. The camera sweeps down to the walls of the atrium, where large tiles are breaking loose as more black ooze pours out and spreads across the floor. Jenna walks toward the camera, trying hard not to step in the gunk. She stares at Mike for several seconds, and then keeps walking past him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Place has gone to hell…” he mutters into the microphone. He then asks Jenna, “Are we doing another walk? Nothing’s changing with the doors. The people and the stores are almost gone, but the doors are still solid, Jen…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If everything is burning off or melting, then a way out &lt;em&gt;has to&lt;/em&gt; emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, maybe… But we’ve been going back and forth for a few hours…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to the food court to see if there’s anything left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not sure that’s a good idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He follows her anyway, and they cross through a hallway that looks more like a moving, dripping cave system of black magma than anything human hands made. I think it’s all being reclaimed by the device that projected a version of the mall that emulates its past—but one that never really existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make it to the food court, now nearly pitch-black as its primary light source, sunlight, has been all but completely blotted out. The food is darker still. The sub sandwiches, Chinese noodles and rice, and Sbarro’s pastas and pizzas have lost their color and form as they also turn into slag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing left…” Jenna sighs. “God damn it. I’m so hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just hope that, you know, what we ate before passed through us enough and we don’t have any of this nasty stuff inside us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two look down at the one of the shoppers’ heads on the floor, separated from its body and still staring ahead mindlessly in a pool of its own gunk. They don’t remark on it. It really must be a common sight by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike?” Jenna says, while the camera is still pointed at the floor. “What is it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That kid… You’ve got to be shitting me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What about him?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike walks off, only bringing the camera back up when he’s a few feet away from a young boy, five or six years old. His gooey insides are still intact, for now, and he looks blankly into space like all the others. I put the pieces together on why Mike suddenly sounds so upset just before he confirms it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jen, that’s &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Why am I here? Why…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She comes over to get a look at young Michael, and then tries to comfort the adult one as he keeps the camera on the kid’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t mean anything,” she tells him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can you say that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever created this place just… It pulled from a pool of faces, maybe full of everyone who ever came here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But that could be over a million people. Why did I just now find the young me? Where was he? How does… &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; this is know who I am? This is all so screwed up. It’s messing with us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know we’re never going to get an answer. Let’s just go back to looking for a door. Or maybe focus on staying safe until a path opens for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike takes a deep breath and turns the camera back around to show the two of them again, both clearly exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He works up the confidence to say, “The next time we turn this thing on… we’ll be filming our escape. Or already back in our hotel room. I’m sick of this place. I think we’ll be taking our channel in a different direction after this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both lock eyes and share a brief kiss before this video ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-22&#34;&gt;File #22&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Mike lied. Created another two hours later, this one starts with &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; shot of the skylights and part of the wall right beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, finally, it seems things are reverting. The thick fog of particles has disappeared, and there’s a few feet worth of the more recent, aged atrium wall between the ceiling windows and the black goop, which is no longer actively moving. Instead, the material is now like a dried, flaking crust. A few chunks break off of the mass and turn to dust on the way down. It’s as if the 2013 version of the mall is emerging from a cocoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey… It’s us again, hopefully for the last time,” Mike says and gets both of them back in frame. Their eyes are half-closed, and they look ready to sleep for a week. “Well… we still couldn’t find a way out… But it’s starting to look like we just have to keep waiting a little longer. Sleepy Pines is returning to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very slowly,” Jenna adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, look at this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sweeping 360-degree shot, he shows off the atrium and the three main hallways. It’s all coated black, including the floor, turning the place into a demented Dali painting. It absorbs all of the color and most of the light, but there is enough sheen to the crusty darkness to make out its melted wax shapes and texture. The two stand to avoid sitting on the stuff, since all of the chairs and couches are also gunkified. Even the fountain has been affected, and it’s now just a solid black basin that still holds its water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the people are gone, melted into the floor,” Mike sighs. “The, uh… &lt;em&gt;fragrance fiend&lt;/em&gt; has been MIA for a while now, so… I think we scared her off or something, and it’s all coming to an end.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin to feel some relief myself, after having an elevated heartbeat for nearly an hour from the safety of my office chair. I start hoping again that they made it out, but just dropped the camera on the way. I look at the little thing on my desk, my mind still trying to process the idea that it had been twisted into a very different size, shape, and model before being twisted right back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike goes on to say, “We still don’t know what happened to our phones, so… hopefully we’ll be able to flag down a car, get some food, get back to our hotel room, close the curtain, sleep… Sound good, Jen? … Jen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looks over to see her staring down at her shoes, which he quickly gets into frame. They’ve changed back into a modern pair of sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mike, it worked…” Jenna murmurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Y-yeah, I guess. It just took a long time. Did you feel anything?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My feet tingled for a second, and then I looked down, and—” she stops suddenly as a loud, thundering crack echoes throughout the atrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The hell was that?” Mike exclaims and swings the camera all the way around to show a large segment of the melted black wall near the KB Toys store breaking apart. “Jen, I think it’s speeding up! We might be able to get out in just a few minutes!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, thank god,” she breathes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wall cracks again, and then a torrent of ooze which never dried comes pouring out. Mike takes a step back, and the three of us watch in dread as an inky arm emerges from the opening, its claw-covered hand grasping the side to tear open the rest of the chrysalis. Like a grotesque insect emerging from inside, four more arms spring out and quickly rip apart the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deformed, hulking dark mass over seven feet tall lurches forward, its four legs and nine arms wriggling about as if they’re trying to free themselves from the true owner of the body. The disgusting and horrifying chimera has five mouths, at least that I can see, but only a single eyeball manages to protrude from the dripping fleshy shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple voices, all of them dissonant and guttural, manage to gurgle out, “Try… our… new… fall scent…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus Christ!” Mike yells out and grabs for the tripod, resting against one of the lounge chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he can grasp it, the monstrous creature emits a loud buzzing sound—the camera picks it up this time. For Mike and Jenna, it’s so painful and deafening that they have to cover their ears. In doing so, Mike ends up flinging the camera away. It lands at an angle in the melted floor, where the dried ooze covers a part of its lens. The moment the shrieking begins is also when more dead pixels start to appear, much faster than when it happened previously. Every two or three seconds that pass, another one pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still able to see enough of the scene that follows to discern what happens next. Though in pain, the couple manage to get their weapons, and as the creature stumbles into the frame, Mike hits its body and multiple arms with his tripod several times with as much force as he can muster. Jenna jams her metal bar into its body, but it gets lodged into the mass and starts sinking into it. When she realizes she can’t pull it out, she begins spraying the creature with foam from the fire extinguisher. It seems to slow it down, but that isn’t enough for either of them; they know they need to destroy it, or at least try to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its body covered in foam, and maybe blinded by it, Jenna shoves the entire red canister into one of its mouths. Mike bashes the extinguisher in deeper with the tripod, and the handle audibly gets squeezes within its maw. More foam is dispensed directly down its gullet, paralyzing the abomination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenna grabs Mike’s hand and gestures toward the fountain, I guess seeing it as their best option—though I lack the information to know exactly what they expect it to do for them. Even so, they run off into the background of the shot and visibly jump into the water. They don’t emerge before the video ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last ten seconds, after the foam stops pouring out of the creature’s mouths, it collapses to the ground—where it starts crawling towards the fountain, screeching and sprouting more arms as it does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over half of the video’s pixels either dead or showing nothing but the blackness the lens is sinking into, the clip finally ends on its own, likely because the camera is too badly damaged to continue recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-23&#34;&gt;File #23&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a conclusion, but I should have expected that I wouldn’t get one. My PC never generated a thumbnail for this final file, so I knew in advance that there would be something wrong with it. The warning about it being damaged doesn’t deter me from trying alternate ways to see inside it. The file size is over 25 MB, so there has to be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; within its bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after trying several file restoration and video editing programs, I manage to extract some information. It’s nine seconds long, though that means little when everything about the file is corrupted to begin with. The audio is nothing but a loud buzz similar to what the creature let out, and nearly every frame of video is just a mess of the jumbled greens and blacks of more unreadable data. Even so, I want to say I did everything possible, so I go through the video frame by frame—all sixty of them for each second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two frames, one five seconds in and the other just near the end, survived and are decipherable, despite still having a flood of pink dead pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is a single frame still of Sleepy Pines during the day, looking normal with a few shoppers walking about. Many of the stores are closed or empty, but the arcade is still open, placing this image sometime before 1998 but after the events across the rest of the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one takes me back to where it all began, showing the totem in the lost and found room, blurred by camera motion. It’s a duplicate frame from File 10. The remaining several hundred frames remain corrupt, and the date created for #23 defaults to the Unix time of January 1, 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the last file was created by pressing the record button. My guess is that it was generated via hardware error, possibly while the camera was reverting back to its natural form. But that doesn’t explain where it could have pulled that picture of the mall in decline, taken years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stay up another hour into the night, researching anything I can think of about the mall, or Mike and Jenna. I find the commercial we saw being shot by the Corvette on YouTube. I almost believe I might see the couple walking about in the background. But I go through the retro thirty-second spot for the mall several times, and none of the featured smiling shoppers look anything like them. Even so, seeing all the era-appropriate clothes and the appearance of the mall make me appreciate just how accurately the strange, unknown, and missing device managed to recreate the place from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, at four in the morning as I’m starting to crash, something casts doubt on the genuineness of everything I just saw. Although Mike never posted about it on what little social media presence he had, I find out through another student’s Facebook posts from Mike’s university days that he attended several special effects classes in his junior and senior years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go to bed thinking about what this might mean, and how it really could have all just been an elaborate underground art project. Maybe Mike had melted several cameras and placed them about in abandoned malls to attract attention to himself or become the star of some new urban legend. He and Jenna could very well be missing on their own accord, just to make it all appear authentic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with those doubts, I go through the files several more times across the following days, looking for any giveaways that everything was faked, albeit very well. But I’m not very good at spotting the tricks he could’ve used, or seeing the imperfections in any elements you’d need a computer to render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lunch with the buddy who gave me the camera a week later and tell him all about it. We end up having a laugh, and he gets me out of a rut that resulted from my viewing experience by telling me that he was almost certain it was all faked, because it just sounds “too Hollywood horror” to be true. In a few years, Mike, and maybe Jenna as well, would surely emerge as modern artistic visionaries, and everyone that had found a copy of their videos would have something worth a small fortune on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite saying all of that, as we head out of the restaurant, he does mention two final little details. The camera, it turns out… was found somehow &lt;em&gt;embedded&lt;/em&gt; inside one of the mall floor tiles. Oh, and one more thing. Early in the demolition, his crew found a metal bucket in one of the food court kitchens with several unexplainable bite marks around its edges, like “someone with a strong pair of chompers snacked on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gets quiet for a moment after revealing these findings, but then grins and adds, “Maybe those two kids were just &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t bury the part of me that believes everything I saw, and knows deep down that what happened to Mike and Jenna is, in fact, a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m still in the area, I drive to what remains of Sleepy Pines one last time. And on this visit, I get a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good look at the mural, coming up close to it, while my mind fixates on what might have transpired on the now-barren grounds. I try to remember what it was like when I was younger, back when I first visited the mall and had studied the intricate swirls, finding secret critters among the dark forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I think they’re all still there, just waiting to be broken apart and tossed into a landfill. But on closer inspection, I find that the elegant brushstrokes of the nighttime woods suddenly end and are not present in the last third of the mural on the left side, where it was still blank and incomplete in Mike and Jenna’s videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paint is still there, as are the trees and dark colors of that ominous forest, but the subtle texture only the touch of human hands can create has been replaced by something mechanical; what was changed and then changed back is now an unfeeling reproduction that could never get right the true authenticity of real historical art, made by someone who cared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s Note: After some thought, and due to the highly sensitive nature of some of the topics in this story, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to add a small disclaimer here. Not because I fear that people will be offended or even take this story seriously and actually hurt someone. Simply because we live in a society that shuns creative minds when they dip into the unsettling side of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let it be said that this story is 100% fiction, and the suggestive themes of murder and suicide are for entertainment purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regret feeling the need to add this, but these are sensitive times, and I need to protect myself from the less understanding types. Thank you, everyone, for the phenomenal support I&amp;rsquo;ve received so far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered a horrifying truth&amp;hellip; and now extinction may be the best hope we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds crazy, and yes, the things I now know may be too much for our species to grasp. While the effects of your mind shattering might ultimately serve humanity&amp;rsquo;s greater interests, I suppose the parts of me that remain human still possess some morbid, misplaced sympathy for the ignorant. After all, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived countless lifetimes blissfully unaware that we, as a species, are trapped. Not quite dead, but doomed in a purgatory-like state that, unless we intervene, will persist until all the stars in the sky go dim&amp;ndash;and perhaps even beyond. Even so, this is the only reality we&amp;rsquo;ve ever known, and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but understand those who&amp;rsquo;d simply prefer not to know. I only pray that our jailor doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize what I&amp;rsquo;ve done here. For all I know, it can simply unmake every bit of progress I&amp;rsquo;ve suffered for, or even alter my memories and turn me back into one of the blissfully unaware meat puppets to which humanity has been reduced. I&amp;rsquo;ve eluded discovery so far. I just need to make enough people aware so that we can do something to change our fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; If you&amp;rsquo;re still here, you&amp;rsquo;re either ready for the truth, or I&amp;rsquo;m about to break another mind. Last chance to turn back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life in the late 2010s. That&amp;rsquo;s where we are right now, right? Humanity is the same as ever; warring for ridiculous reasons, pushing the envelope with new technologies, and overall trying to find a purpose in our otherwise dull and uninteresting lives. I had cursed the daily slog, getting up every morning to trudge my way to my dead-end job and secretly hope that some great stroke of misfortune would strike my workplace and render it inaccessible&amp;ndash;at least for a week or two. A gas leak, or some huge mess, or hell, a meteorite the size of a football crashing through the walk-in freezer. Something ridiculous like that. Knowing what I do now, the tedium of lower-middle-class American life seems hopeful. Ideal, even, compared to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that I first became aware&amp;ndash;at least, when I first began to peel back the layers of the veil of lies which composes our entire perception of the world around us. I was walking to work one morning, across the road in what I like to call mid-rural Florida. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t all farmland and hillbillies, but the nearest Walmart was a good fifteen minutes away. A sleepy town at the edge of the suburbs, but before you hit the trailer parks, creepy farm houses, and swamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, quiet as it was, some things were the same no matter where you went. Maybe he&amp;rsquo;d been driving too fast for me to realize he was coming, or perhaps I&amp;rsquo;d simply fallen so deeply into the motions of the daily grind that I&amp;rsquo;d just mechanically wandered into the crosswalk without even looking. Neither determination would have changed the outcome as the dark-colored SUV plowed into my soft, frail human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true what they say; when you come close to death, everything just stops. For a moment I even thought the driver had slammed on his brakes and barely nudged me&amp;ndash;but the sensation of the life slowly draining from my swiftly-breaking body made it all too real: This was what dying felt like. I caught the driver&amp;rsquo;s eye in the split second we shared during the final moment of my life. Terror flashed across his gaze, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure it did mine, before the light drained from the world, and all sensation except for the dullest, most disconcertingly muted thud of impact left my perception. &amp;ldquo;Dead on impact&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m sure the autopsy would have said. Barely enough time to even register the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is it,&amp;rdquo; I remember thinking, now, though at the time I was surprised I still had such a capacity for thought. &amp;ldquo;Bring on the pearly gates or the fiery abyss. Nothing stopping it now.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d never been a religious man. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s what ultimately kept me sane through this whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For just a moment, I became aware of something. Sensation. Movement. Not like someone was hefting my unmoving corpse onto a stretcher or anything&amp;ndash;this was manual limb control. Locomotion. My arms, my legs&amp;hellip; but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in control. Everything was dark, and there was only a faint clattering sound, like needles tapping on glass. Discontinuity followed, and as far as I was aware, I was alive again. Only I wasn&amp;rsquo;t me, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually &amp;lsquo;aware&amp;rsquo; of anything that&amp;rsquo;d just plowed my awareness from a mangled corpse into a new, working body. I was&amp;ndash;well, let me stop there before I get hung up on who I actually am&amp;ndash;or was, for that matter. It&amp;rsquo;ll be irrelevant before long, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to know is that I was reincarnated. We all are, it seems, but not in a manner you&amp;rsquo;ve come to expect. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;reborn&amp;rdquo;, so much as I was&amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;inserted&amp;rsquo; into another body roughly the same age as my past self. New identity, new memories, new&amp;hellip; me. Completely seamless, without any knowledge of what had just happened. At least, at first. Life carried on like I&amp;rsquo;d never met my end at the business end of a speeding motor vehicle, and my existence on the complete opposite end of the world seemed as normal as ever. Until, of course, humanity exemplified both its lust for destruction and its unerring frailty once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next death came at the hands of a homeless man on the streets of Moscow. He&amp;rsquo;d asked for change that I simply didn&amp;rsquo;t have, and responded with an empty bottle of vodka to the back of my head when I relayed this to him. Once again, curtains of darkness drew over the world, and I became distinctly aware of being someplace other than the cold, snowy streets of Russia. Even more perplexing: I remembered the car accident. Every little detail of the wreck that had claimed my previous life was as fresh as if it&amp;rsquo;d just occurred. Before I could even think to puzzle over this, I felt this dark world slip away, but not before I heard the odd clattering sound again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through many lives after that, in many places. Africa. Asia. Back in the US. I can barely remember most of them. It seems like only violent deaths can bring me back to that horrible place beyond the terminus of life. But through it all, I began to piece some things together, and the dark world that lingered in my perception after death became more clear. After a particularly gruesome death courtesy of a pair of wild dogs in Australia, I of course returned to the world beyond. Only this time, something changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see. For the first time, whatever passed for eyes in this body of mine could sense the world around me. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t control where they looked, nor did I recognize the dark amber walls surrounding me, but I could finally see just where I went after each bloody death. I could tell it was dark, but my eyes were accustomed to it, perhaps built for low-light environments. I could also move, but I was not in control of my motions. At this point, I was a prisoner in this body, peering out through alien windows as whatever contained my consciousness moved about these dark, yellow-orange tunnels. The walls themselves looked almost organic. Chitinous or resinous, maybe. Slightly shiny, like they were wet. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything, but once again I heard the tapping, tinking, clattering sound. I heard it in the distance, and very close every time my body walked. This surreal experienced lasted maybe fifteen minutes, providing a short-lived tour through the strange, alien tunnels, before I was pulled from purgatory and back into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, my recollection of this place ceased until my next bloody death. Again, my perception of it grew stronger, and continued to do so each time my life came to an abrupt and violent end. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember how many times I&amp;rsquo;d gone through the cycle before the bombshell of dreadful, horrible truth descended upon my mind and mangled my perception of life, existence, and the universe as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t even recall how I&amp;rsquo;d died that time. I think the trauma of finding out where I went with each death took that knowledge wherever it took my sanity. For all the times I&amp;rsquo;d been to this place, I&amp;rsquo;d never seen another living soul, never spotted what made the strange clattering sound, and still had no idea what kind of body I had&amp;ndash;if I even had one at all. For all I knew, I was just a soul in a jar being carried around by a demon, and this place was Hell. Really, that would have been preferable; the Biblical Hell was all fire, brimstone, and suffering, but at least you knew what you had. What you were. No one could have imagined this&amp;ndash;no human mind in that pathetically luddite era of our history could have conceived of the things I now know, and if they had I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;d have killed themselves to ensure they never met this fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was walking along&amp;ndash;well, being walked, I should say, as I still had no control over my limbs&amp;ndash;and eventually came to a new part of the world beyond. The tunnels opened into an enormous antechamber, where what appeared to be translucent pods made of rough glass or resin lined the towering walls. It was here that I finally saw them; the denizens of this horrible place. Huge, vaguely insectoid and pale. Vestigial wings hung limp from their back, and four spindly legs arched upward and curled down from a body that could only be described as a centaur of Greek myth, but all chitin, four arms tipped with grasping claws, and a vaguely wasp-like head, complete with twitching antennae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to scream, but my lips either refused to move or simply did not exist. Looking back, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what good it would have done. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything else but to vocalize the horror of what unfolded before my eyes. The bug things were lowering the resin tubes off the walls, their needle-like legs piercing into the wall and allowing them to scale the sheer, amber surface. Here, the clicking and tapping sound was at its loudest, and I realized now what it was: The tapping of their feet against the resinous floors and walls. There must have been thousands of them in these caverns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panic rose in the phantom space that might have been my heart, as I was made to approach the wall. Up close, the things were just as pale and grotesque as anything else you&amp;rsquo;d expect to find in a near-lightless environment. There had to be a dozen in the room right now, some coming and going as they worked to peel open the tubes and retrieve some unseen treasure from inside. Many of the bugs appeared to be injured or damaged in some way; their carapaces pocked with holes, some missing entire limbs. Whatever the cause, they appeared entirely unconcerned with their wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped at the foot of the wall. I suppose I should have put two and two together by this point, but my mind refused to accept the theory stringing together in my mind. I watched a bug thing higher on the wall pass a tube down to a lower one. Then one even lower. Then&amp;hellip; to me. Four chitinous graspers took careful hold of the tube and, with unimaginable strength, hauled it aside and set it down. My mind spun as I witnessed the hands&amp;ndash;the ones attached to this body from which I viewed this terrible world&amp;ndash;tear into the resinous membrane at the front of the tube. Only when my body tilted forward so it could view its own handiwork did I finally realize the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large, compound eyes. Wasp-like face, complete with antennae. Sharp, pincered mandibles. This was me. My face. My body. My hands. My prison. I think the shock of my realization awakened me to something, as sensation began to creep into my horrible clawed extremities. I begged for it to go away, to retreat into the recesses of whatever veil had held it back. This couldn&amp;rsquo;t be me. I was a human being! This was all some horrible pre-death nightmare that only seemed quite so long because of the time distortion we experienced in dreams. My death at the intersection was my only true death, and I was just dreaming the rest of this. Just dreaming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the sensation persisted. No veil of darkness swept the world away, and no beam of light carried me to the heavens and away from this hellish world. I watched helplessly as the resin glass was torn away, and a dazed, but otherwise seemingly unharmed human came into view. The clawed hands which I refused to call my own made quick work of that, piercing into the man&amp;rsquo;s carotid artery, producing a spray of blood and a gurgling sound I had previously figured exaggerated for gory movies. It tore into that body, dissecting flesh and bone with its powerful claws, ripping viscera apart and completely dismembering the human corpse. The sensation of human body parts squishing under my fingers made me want to vomit into the ethereal void that was my existence. Other workers approached and began to cart the mess of organs, limbs, and tissues away. My body carefully took the head in its hands, its claws effortlessly snapping off the jaw, ripping flesh from bone, and cracking the skull in just the right way to remove the intact prize waiting within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It discarded the rest of the head, tossing the remnants into the open chest cavity of its victim, which another drone casually hefted into its impossibly powerful arms and began to cart away to places unknown. At this point, the darkness began to return. Despite my terror, I fought against it, clawed at the awareness of this world, desperate and horrified to know where this hellish rabbit hole went! I think something broke that time. Something in the system of life and death as it has been for humanity for&amp;hellip; god, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know how long, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I awoke to my new life, a flood of memories threatening to overtake me. A woman sat across from me at a table, and two children looked on vacantly. I nearly choked on the pasta in my mouth, and some words sputtered out in apology&amp;ndash;in Swedish, I think, but I can&amp;rsquo;t tell. No one looked at me. I hastily excused myself and stumbled upstairs, toward what I vaguely recognized as my bedroom. The tunnels. The bug things. I could still remember them, even now! Death brought me back there&amp;hellip; so to find out what happened, I needed to die. And it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be clean, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dug through a drawer and found a large pocket knife. My mind raced&amp;ndash;What the hell was I going to do? Yes, I had to know the truth, no matter how horrifying, but at what cost? Through the haze of broken, disjointed memories half-inserted into my addled brain, I realized that the woman downstairs must have been my wife, and those children&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even think of it. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just be my life I was destroying. As I struggled to make my decision, however, I realized something: They hadn&amp;rsquo;t reacted at all when I&amp;rsquo;d stormed off from the table. None of them had even looked at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back downstairs and peered around the corner. They were still there at the table; my wife and two kids, mechanically forking noodles into their mouths. There was something horribly inhuman about the way they ate. I called out to my wife, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t answer. I yelled to her this time&amp;ndash;still nothing. What the hell was going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More fascinated than concerned, I hurried into the kitchen and smacked one of the kids in the back of the head. He didn&amp;rsquo;t even flinch. He just kept eating. When I slid his plate away, he just reached his arm out farther for it. Not a single one appeared to realize I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d seen enough. Whatever this was, it sure as hell wasn&amp;rsquo;t the answers I sought. I brought the knife to my throat, held my breath, and did the deed. The pain surging through me as the blade pierced my carotid artery distracted me from the compulsion to stay in this place, to embrace the lie and forget the horrors I&amp;rsquo;d seen. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. I had to go back to the truth, to see where it all wound up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to bleed out. Sure enough, my consciousness returned to the inside of the wasp thing in the tunnels. It had made its way to another part of the structure, to what I could best describe as the end of an assembly line. Hundreds of fresh, new workers, free of any blemishes or wounds, sat lined up on the floor, their bodies rising and falling with their respirations, but otherwise inert. My organic prison skittered toward the nearest drone and, grasping the human brain in one hand, took hold of the new drone&amp;rsquo;s head and pried open the back plate of its chitinous exoskeleton. The damn thing had a hollow head, save for the end of a spinal column. My hands carefully maneuvered the fresh brain into the drone&amp;rsquo;s head, setting it atop the spine. Another hand went to my mouth, where a glob of sickly grey-green mucous was coughed up. The taste brought on another phantom gag reflex, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even begin to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disgusting snot ball was slathered around the base of the brain and spine, and the new drone&amp;rsquo;s head was closed up. Its body twitched a couple times, then went full-on grand mal for half a minute. All the drones in the room stopped, but I hardly even noticed; the psychic scream ringing in my head was enough to drive me teetering back to the realm of the living, but I somehow managed to hang on just long enough to endure it. God, I wish I hadn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memories flashed before my eyes. School children. Homework. A first kiss, maybe. First job. A funeral. Then, a black sky. Military air raid sirens, followed by the deafening rumble and blinding light of a MOAB colliding with&amp;hellip; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our jailor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I awoke in a human body once again. Just like last time, I was thrust into a brand new life, already in progress. Now, however, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to fight away the new memories. They came, and they found their place, but they were foreign. Irrelevant. The truth had firmly burned itself into my real brain. The one sitting in the once-vacant skull of a mass-produced drone, birthed by an entity humanity never had any hope of defeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman who must have been my wife shifted and turned toward me in our bed. She asked me what was wrong, and I responded effortlessly to her in French, telling her I was fine. She hummed sleepily and turned back over, apparently content. Her name was Amalie. We had two children, Jean and Camille. I was a successful software engineer, and she was a school teacher. All things considered, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a bad life to live. I could forget everything I&amp;rsquo;d seen and just continue on in ignorance. Hell, at least she realized I existed, unlike the Swedish woman. I could start over like this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. This life wasn&amp;rsquo;t real. Nothing past January 4th of 2011 was real. I remembered it all, now; my last&amp;ndash;or,rather, my only true death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA and the ESA had co-discovered the anomaly in &amp;lsquo;02. An absolutely massive patch of dark space, slowly edging across the sky. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t be seen by anything but the most powerful telescopes of the time, and it was nowhere near us&amp;hellip; or so we figured. This curiosity turned nightmarish, as one day the shadow completely vanished, only to be discovered around three-thousand light years away from its original location. Not only that, but it had gotten closer. This continued for the next eight years; the shadow would travel to some seemingly random place in space, only to disappear and reappear again. Each time, it drew nearer. Each new discovery raised more and more alarm among the scientists studying the phenomenon, and word eventually got out that something big was headed our way. We still couldn&amp;rsquo;t see what it was, of course. Space is dark, and it was still outside our solar system, unlit by any of our stellar neighbors. Even if light had reached it, we simply didn&amp;rsquo;t have the technology to properly image it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have mattered, anyway. All the world&amp;rsquo;s combined arsenals, nuclear and otherwise, would have dented this thing at best. We knew it, too, when it finally appeared at the edge of the solar system, its vaguely circular body surrounded by pale, fleshy tendrils and jagged, rocky-looking flesh. If this thing wanted to kill us, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to try hard. Best estimates put the thing at just over fifty thousand kilometers across. About five times planet Earth&amp;rsquo;s diameter, give or take. Yet despite its immense size, it seemed to have no gravitational effect on the bodies around it; it passed right by Pluto without flinging the tiny non-planet into the depths of space, nor did it appear at all disturbed by Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s immense pull. This tendril-covered pseudo-planet spat in the face of gravity, and singlemindedly floated toward its destination: Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panic the likes of which no disaster movie could depict soon ensued. The approaching entity had done nothing to prompt any feeling of dread; it hadn&amp;rsquo;t fired any weapons, shown any aggression, or so much as nudge another planetary body on its way here. But humans are flighty creatures at the best of times. People acted like the end was already upon us, pouring into churches, murdering those who&amp;rsquo;d wronged them in some final acts of revenge, fleeing the resulting carnage and chaos, or committing suicide en masse. Those who died before our jailor&amp;rsquo;s arrival were the lucky ones, at least if their brains were destroyed in the process. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it can use the broken ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the day so vividly now. It&amp;rsquo;s as if the newly-activated drone&amp;rsquo;s seizing had reawakened it in my mind; some side-effect of the hivemind that keeps them running, combined with the final desperate cries of the freshly-implanted brain before its awareness was suppressed, its consciousness shunted into a new, artificial life. But I remember. The horrible tentacled thing rose over the horizon before it&amp;rsquo;d even gotten close. In the days before its arrival, people had formed cults dedicated to sacrificing their fellow man in its name, so that they might be spared. I never really learned of their fate, but I don&amp;rsquo;t imagine this thing cared for their paltry offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing&amp;rsquo;s rocky surface lit up with tiny flashes of distant nuclear fire in the month leading up to its arrival; a sort of final act of rebellion in the face of complete annihilation. We all knew that, even if we managed to kill this thing, it was on a crash course with Earth. We&amp;rsquo;d be obliterated on impact. But humans are warlike at our cores, even if people refuse to admit it. There&amp;rsquo;s something deeply primal about killing something that&amp;rsquo;s trying to kill you, even if it won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean your survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the nuclear bombardment stopped. The world governments, suddenly freed from their old hatreds and conflicts, decided to hold the rest of their arsenal, on the odd chance that this thing meant to invade Earth, rather than simply crush it in some massive, unseen jaws. Well, they were half-right. An invasion did happen. They were simply wrong in their assumption that their weapons would make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world darkened. Massive tendrils plunged into the ground, causing earthquakes the likes of which we&amp;rsquo;d never recorded. Ground defenses worldwide were rendered largely useless, and millions died in the resulting upheaval. I was one of the lucky ones, if you can call us that. Entire countries were reshaped overnight due to mass flooding and tectonic shifts, but those who survived were in for an even greater horror. The bug things. They descended through the tendrils, as if they were colossal, fleshy elevators, pouring out of hollow openings and charging heedlessly into the resisting human ranks. Unlike their floating master, the bugs could be killed. Hundreds of thousands were torn apart by gunfire, mortars, and aerial strikes. For months, the remaining holdouts fought the invaders, many opting for suicide to prevent capture, lest they be subject to whatever horrible things lie in wait up the fleshy tendrils and inside the colossal monstrosity above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our numbers waned and the ceaseless flow of enemies trampled over their own dead, the few remaining aerial transports opted to deliver nuclear devices to the front lines. Once a position was overrun, a bomb would be detonated, absolutely devastating the enemy ranks. But for every dead bug, two more seemed to crawl from the tendrils. They gathered the charred, irradiated remains of friend and foe alike, and crawled up the tentacle tunnels from which they came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met my end in the same manner as the human screaming in my head. I was captured, dosed with some kind of aerosol sedative, and stuffed into one of those resin pods. It was placed into one of the tendril walls, and slowly drawn into the upper levels of the creature in space. In my haze, I felt hopeful; maybe if we could kill enough of these things, we could get inside and strike back. We could kill the master. Maybe even survive in the apocalyptic hell it&amp;rsquo;d brought upon us. I held onto that hope even as one of these goddamn bugs tore my body to shreds, and I slipped into the all-encompassing darkness that is true death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I woke up, a new man, and you know the rest. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you whether Heaven or Hell are real. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any human alive that day will ever know, unless we do something to free ourselves from this madness. I&amp;rsquo;ve died, lived, and died again so many times since I learned the truth, and I have some theories about what exactly this thing is. This is more than just the musing of a madman; I believe the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned may yet save us from this fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, our home is gone. Forget all illusions about going back to Earth, because there simply isn&amp;rsquo;t an Earth to go back to. Over time, I&amp;rsquo;ve dipped into the hivemind, listening to the echoes of thought riding on psychic waves that control the drones, and I&amp;rsquo;ve watched it tear apart our beloved planet more times than I probably should have. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this thing&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, its ideas, its&amp;hellip; dreams. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you why it&amp;rsquo;s doing this; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t think like we do. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t communicate in words or syllables. It speaks in a language of ideas. Of urges. Of intent. It drives its drones to do things, and they do them. To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t even think it&amp;rsquo;s consciously aware of the state of humanity. In my push to understand this thing&amp;rsquo;s mind and comprehend its thoughts, I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across any impression that it does anything but maintain the illusion in which we all live. But therein lies the tiny sliver of hope I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to dredge from the depths of my broken mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something this big and this powerful expends a lot of energy. Even its means of teleporting through space&amp;ndash;a mechanism I still fail to understand&amp;ndash;can&amp;rsquo;t bring it to its destination instantaneously. It coasts along in space in a dreamlike state to preserve what energy it has, using its drones to process organic material from the species it harvests. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;species&amp;rsquo;, plural. We aren&amp;rsquo;t alone up here. Not only did this thing take every living human from planet Earth, it also consumed all the plant and animal matter it could find, and every last scrap of mineral-rich earth it got its tendrils on. But more than that, there are other minds up here. Minds which were here before humans were taken. Minds from other worlds, trapped in similar illusions to ours. For now, they seem to be unreachable, but I believe that if we make enough humans aware, we can save them, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings me to my plan, and stay with me on this. I&amp;rsquo;m alive right now&amp;ndash;well, in the facsimile of life that you call planet Earth in 2019. I&amp;rsquo;ve written these notes in just about every language known to man, having lived through so many lives already and retained so many memories. For now, this plan is safe from the prying eyes of our jailor, as it&amp;rsquo;s still asleep, scanning the cosmos with senses indescribable to human minds, in search of new life to absorb. Why it does this is still beyond my understanding; maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a living vacuum cleaner, sucking up the garbage life in the universe. God only knows we&amp;rsquo;d qualify. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s some sick and twisted means of cataloguing life and preserving it before it&amp;rsquo;s wiped out by some cataclysm. Or perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s completely meaningless, like all life, and the universe is just cruel and unforgiving and horrifying in ways we could have never comprehended. I suppose we&amp;rsquo;ll never know, but there is a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to die. Not only do you have to die, and gruesomely so, but you have to kill. As many people as possible. Brutally. Violently. Take as many lives as you can, as often as you can, and spread the HELL out of this message. I know it sounds insane, and I hope it is. God, I hope I&amp;rsquo;ve just done a metric ton of drugs and been delirious for the past decade. Anything would be preferable to this hell. But you have to believe it. Surely you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the signs already: Flickers of memories from past lives, sensations of deja vu, and the sense that half the people around you are just facsimiles of human life, waiting for a soul&amp;ndash;a mind&amp;ndash;to be implanted. That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re stuck into already-set lives after we die; because this thing has invented them for us already. There are empty shells of human beings, like my Swedish family countless lives ago, wandering this pseudo-Earth every day, just waiting for some fool to kick the bucket and fill a new role. And it&amp;rsquo;s so seamless, that it&amp;rsquo;s almost perfect. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave you with this plea: Do your part to save humanity. It&amp;rsquo;s our only hope, not for survival, but an end to our imprisonment. A species-wide mercy killing to free us from the false reality in which our minds are held captive. And I know you&amp;rsquo;re asking, &amp;ldquo;Why would I want to know all this? Is ignorance not bliss, if the alternative is just watching myself chop people up and feed them to a giant space monster all day?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. But here&amp;rsquo;s the juicy part: Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a startling new discovery. I was testing the extent of my senses in my drone body, and I found that I was able to wiggle the end of my antennae. Just the end. Just a little. But like an arm you&amp;rsquo;ve slept funny on that&amp;rsquo;s gone numb overnight, that little wiggle paves the way for greater motion. And if this thing stays asleep long enough for more of us to become aware, well&amp;hellip; we could do a lot of damage, given the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live as a slave, or die free. We&amp;rsquo;ve made that choice as a species time and time again. Why not partake in one last rebellion? One final collective middle finger flipped at the universe that decided we weren&amp;rsquo;t good enough? I&amp;rsquo;ll see you out there, friends. Happy hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it with guys and dick pics?  They just can&amp;rsquo;t resist sending them.  You don&amp;rsquo;t even have to ask most of the time.  It&amp;rsquo;s as if the human male has always had this innate urge to share images of his own cock with unwitting females, and was just waiting for technology to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I&amp;rsquo;m complaining.  This pride men have for their own junk suits me just fine.  In fact, I love it.  It&amp;rsquo;s fun for me.  There&amp;rsquo;s always a jolt of excitement when my phone beeps and a dick pic sprawls across my screen.  Hell, I ask for them in many cases, and these fuckboys are always happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a pic comes in, I stare at it, studying it for a good long while.  I try to imagine the penis in full detail as if were right in front of me in all its glory.  If that one picture&amp;rsquo;s not enough, well that&amp;rsquo;s no problem.  I just ask for another.  And if he&amp;rsquo;s reluctant, I just send a flash of tit in return.  No shame or bashfulness here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my mental image is clear enough, I set to work.  Wax is my favorite medium.  There&amp;rsquo;s just something about it&amp;mdash;how it can be soft one minute and hard the next.  Not unlike the thing I&amp;rsquo;m using it to build.  As I melt it, I sprinkle in my usual mixture: a dash of this, a pinch of that.  I say the usual words.  They&amp;rsquo;re fully memorized by now.  They should be.  I&amp;rsquo;ve done this enough times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, my beautiful work of art stands fully erect before me.  Often, I&amp;rsquo;ll just take a moment to marvel.  I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten so good at this.  The veins, the texture of the skin&amp;hellip;.  It&amp;rsquo;s all so lifelike.  I could probably make a career out of crafting wax dicks if I wanted to.  But I don&amp;rsquo;t.  My dicks are more than art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the fun begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find a paring knife is best.  It&amp;rsquo;s just the right size for most of the cocks I deal with, and it affords me such wonderful precision.  I say the last few words and then in I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite first cut is to trace around the head.  I know everything has worked perfectly when I see redness ooze from the incision and trickle down the shaft.  It&amp;rsquo;s liquid I never put there.  Not by physical means anyway.  It&amp;rsquo;s a sign that the work is being done.  It&amp;rsquo;s exciting and presses me further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I drag the blade down the shaft all the way to the bottom.  The sticky, messy, crimson pool begins to spread. Its smell fills the air: metallic and sickly sweet.  I&amp;rsquo;m practically high from it.  The &amp;ldquo;skin&amp;rdquo; flays back so easily.  Beneath it, a pulsating mass of flesh.  You&amp;rsquo;d hardly believe I started with wax and herbs.  It&amp;rsquo;s amazing what you can accomplish with a little help from the right sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the locker room at the work, I love to hear people talk.  &amp;ldquo;Another one!&amp;rdquo; they say.  &amp;ldquo;Completely destroyed his bits!  And not one of them will say how it happened!  It&amp;rsquo;s always &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know!  I don&amp;rsquo;t know!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; I say, &amp;ldquo;you know how male pride can be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share a laugh.  Some weird self-pleasure trend gone horribly wrong, they assume. All in a day&amp;rsquo;s work at a busy urban hospital.  But it never becomes routine to me.  It never loses its thrill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone beeps before I head out of the locker room.  It&amp;rsquo;s a message from my latest right swipe.  He&amp;rsquo;s sent me the pic I asked for.  How delightful&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dad, come on, you know me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything to Julie. This is all a misunderstanding. She&amp;rsquo;s my wife; I&amp;rsquo;d never hurt her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman&amp;rsquo;s father-in-law grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the wall. He held him there and looked him straight in the eyes. &amp;ldquo;Shut your fucking mouth you piece of shit! I never liked you. You thought she was coming to get her things alone? You thought you&amp;rsquo;d what, ambush her? You&amp;rsquo;re a fucking predator! What, too much of a coward to mess with someone your own size?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big man slid Norman down the wall until he&amp;rsquo;d pushed him into a squatting position. Breathing heavily, he backed up a step and pressed his pointer finger against Norman&amp;rsquo;s forehead, pinning his head to the wall. &amp;ldquo;Since you can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted to stay away while we gather my daughter&amp;rsquo;s things, you&amp;rsquo;re going to sit right where I can keep an eye on you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He backed up a few feet and looked at his son-in-law. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re fucking pathetic. If I had my way, you&amp;rsquo;d be in a cell right now, but she won&amp;rsquo;t press charges and I promised her I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go to the police&amp;hellip; for now. You ever lay a hand on her again,&amp;rdquo; Jonathan Meyers slammed his hand down hard on the kitchen table, &amp;ldquo;And I&amp;rsquo;ll put you in the ground.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixty-two year-old walked to the end of the kitchen and called down the hallway to the master bedroom. &amp;ldquo;Just get what you need right now, honey. We&amp;rsquo;ll return for the rest later.&amp;rdquo; He turned back to Norman who was too much in shock to stand up. Murder was in the old man&amp;rsquo;s eyes. &amp;ldquo;The next time we stop over, the fucking weasel you married won&amp;rsquo;t be here lying in wait.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later Norman watched out the bedroom window while his wife and father-in-law backed out of the driveway and drove away. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t fathom why Julie would say such lies. He knew deep down that nothing she did could ever make him angry enough to lay a hand on her; he loved her. Besides, everyone at work could vouch for him during the supposed time she was attacked. &amp;ldquo;Why would she say it was me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the first time he had seen her since he left for work three days ago. He&amp;rsquo;d spent days trying to figure out where she was. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t reach her on her phone and her parents and friends only spouted profanities at him. The knot in his stomach had wound tighter and tighter every day, every minute, he hadn&amp;rsquo;t known where she was. Now he knew and the whole confusing situation left him feeling sick and defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurt him to see her with black eyes and bandages covering her nose. He nearly threw himself at her feet and begged her to tell him who attacked her when he saw the purplish, black marks on her arms and neck. He wanted to find who hurt her and make them suffer, but everyone was accusing him of the horrible act. Their marriage wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but he loved Julie and he thought she loved him too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rage, fear, sorrow, and a myriad of other emotions bubbled within him. He glanced at himself in the cheval mirror they&amp;rsquo;d just recently bought at an estate sale. The image staring back at him with clenched fists and tears streaming down its face didn&amp;rsquo;t look like the man he usually saw in the glass. The eyes seemed to relay a monstrous intent. It looked like a man capable of beating his wife and far worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shut his eyes and blindly swung his fist at the face of the impostor. Norman&amp;rsquo;s knuckles connecting with the glass should have created quite a racket, but all he could hear was the rapid thumping of his heart. He opened his eyes to reveal a vertical fracture running the length of the mirror, splitting his reflection in two. The violent, evil man he&amp;rsquo;d seen a moment before peered out at him from one side of the crack while the weak, frightened man he knew himself to be stared out from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman staggered right to reveal his weak self in full reflection cowering on its side of the crack. The only food he&amp;rsquo;d eaten all day began to revolt inside his stomach, contending with the throbbing pain he suddenly felt in his knuckles. Seeing his hand dripping blood onto the floor took his thoughts from the mirror for a second. He walked a few feet past the mirror towards the bathroom, but then quickly turned back when it occurred to him it didn&amp;rsquo;t have any blood on it. Reflected in the glass on the left side of the crack was the killer that had beaten his wife, glaring at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned away and fled for the bathroom, but didn&amp;rsquo;t make it before he emptied the contents of his stomach onto the floor. He knelt there before the steaming pile of vomit for quite a while. He eventually willed himself to his feet and stumbled into the kitchen. He clumsily wrapped his hand in paper towels, filled a bucket with soap and water, and returned to his bedroom to scrub the blood and sick off of the hardwood floor; never taking his eyes off his task. When he finished, he properly cleaned his hand, bandaged it, and feebly crawled into bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Norman slept, depraved images skittered through his troubled mind, playing out a sinister fantasy. In the dream, Julie was lying prone on the bed while he straddled her waist, slamming his fists into her face again and again and again. The distinct cracking sound of her nose breaking under his bloody fists, followed by the splintering noise of her cheek bones as he levied both fists simultaneously down upon her, echoed through the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telltale squeak of the mirror tilting on its stand drew his attention from his brutal task. The framed glass made four, five, six full rotations. Each vertical spin revealed a piece of paper on the back of the mirror wedged between the glass and frame. It fluttered and flapped like a flag on a windy day until the mirror came to a stop with one final creak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A billowing, black smoke, limned by a green incandescence, escaped the crack in the glass and rose to the ceiling. An impossibly thin creature, almost two dimensional, could be seen weaving in and out of the smoke just inside the intricately carved wooden frame. It traced the fracture as if it was trying to escape along with the smoke like a fish follows the flow of a stream. Norman could only make out a fraction of it at a time as it occasionally thumped up against the inside of the glass like an eel in a tank unaware of its near invisible boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smoke quickly covered the ceiling and began to crawl down along the walls. It rumbled and flashed, imitating a thundercloud. The mysterious, ribbon-thin serpent swerved violently in and out of sight like a kite caught in a storm. Norman seemed to know instinctively what it wanted. He rolled off the bed, picked up his unrecognizable wife, and flung her limp body at the mirror. He expected the mirror to shatter, but instead she passed through the glass unimpeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman slumbered fitfully, struggling under his heavy, suffocating blanket as the nightmare played out. He fought to escape like a seal caught in a net knowing full well the killing blow could fall at any moment. He awoke covered in sweat just as the thing behind the glass lunged for his wife&amp;rsquo;s lifeless body. He felt no relief upon discovering he&amp;rsquo;d been dreaming. The events as they occurred were etched deeply into the rock walls of his cavernous mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand to look at himself in the mirror, so he awkwardly carried the heavy monstrosity out to the garage, threw an old tarp over it, and went inside to take a shower. The thoughts running through his head were rushing in all directions. They did nothing to help clarify what his dream was all about. &amp;ldquo;What was with that fucked up dream? Julie truly believes I hurt her. I saw it in her eyes last night. She was afraid of me. That fucked up dream, though. Jonathan wanted to kill me. Could I have&amp;hellip; but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t I remember? No, I&amp;rsquo;d never hurt Julie. I&amp;rsquo;m nothing without her. God, that dream was so fucked up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hot shower didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything for his nerves or the tightness in his back. He noticed a pinkish puddle collected around the drain; his hand wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stop bleeding. He filled a cup from the sink and poured its contents over the drain. While the strange thoughts and questions continued to run laps in his skull he dried his right hand and wrapped it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned and knocked the gauze off the edge of the sink, but managed to grab one end as the rest of it hit the tile and rolled out the door. He stepped out of the bathroom as it continued to uncoil along his bedroom floor and into the hall. Still holding the one end, he followed its progress through the house. The gauze finally came to a stop in the kitchen. It pointed right at the door that led to the garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman stared at the door. His eyes were opened so wide with shock that they began to tear. He blinked and when he opened his eyes he was back in the bathroom. The gauze hung from his hand and extended to the tile at his feet, but didn&amp;rsquo;t go any further. The bundle of cotton began to slither and writhe as obscured images of the thing from his dream flashed through his head. He flung the gauze against the wall, retreated into his bedroom, and slammed the door shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shadow of movement showed through the space under the door. Something much more substantial than cotton bandages violently thumbed and bumped against the wood. Norman backed up against his bed and stared until everything went still and silent. He nearly leapt out of his skin when he heard what sounded like the creak of the mirror. He glanced over to where it recently stood and there lying on the floor was a yellowed piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He rushed over and snatched it up. Norman had to squint to make out the very small and intricately penned script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years of doom and woe&lt;br&gt;
Better than to live in Hell&lt;br&gt;
Into the psyche you must go&lt;br&gt;
Unless you break the serpent&amp;rsquo;s spell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman recalled Julie looking up cheval mirrors on her laptop one night while he read next to her in bed. As often happens online, she was eventually drawn away from her intended subject. &amp;ldquo;Did you know our mirror is also called a psyche?&amp;rdquo; He later noticed her furrowed brow which he knew all too well meant she was struggling with some concept or idea she had never thought much about before. &amp;ldquo;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m reading about the totality of the human mind now. Yeah, I think some people just think too much.&amp;rdquo; That eventually led her to the tale of Eros and Psyche before she ended her night watching cute cat videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split second memory of his loving wife was eradicated by images of her battered face. Her broken nose and black eyes quickly melted into the bloody, pulped mask she wore in his dream right before she was flung into the mirror. He was rushing down the hall before he could fully collect his thoughts. He came to a halt in the kitchen, panting like he&amp;rsquo;d just sprinted a mile and stared at the door to the garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what was happening, but he knew it was the time for quick decisive actions. Everything else going wrong in his life fell to the wayside as he took a long, steadying gulp of air, grabbed the frying pan off the stove, and stalked up to the door. He could hear the steady rumble of his car as he gripped the doorknob with his sweaty hand and turned it. He flung open the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing there in his wife&amp;rsquo;s empty parking spot was the mirror. The tarp was lying in a heap beside it. All of his resolve to vanquish the sinister evil preying upon his sanity faded before the nonstick copper pan hit the cement floor with a cluster of clangs. Norman just stood there stuttering, &amp;ldquo;H-h-how?&amp;rdquo; over and over again. His attention was focused on the mirror&amp;rsquo;s flawless surface; it reflected nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curling wisps of smoke like the crawling cloud from his dream inhabited every inch of space between its mahogany frame. His naked image stepped into view. It turned to face Norman, scowled at him like his third grade teacher, Mrs. Viscol, did when a student was misbehaving, and then mimed slamming a door shut. The door smacked into Norman&amp;rsquo;s back and knocked him down the steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tumbled onto the unforgiving cement floor and rolled to a stop before the mirror. He rose to his knees, but quickly fell onto his side when a sharp pain jolted through his foot. The excruciating pain and nauseating fumes spilling from his car&amp;rsquo;s exhaust pipe answered only one of the many questions running through his head. Actually, the thing that looked just like him did. &amp;ldquo;Yes, your life will be over shortly, but you can still save your pretty wife.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman peered up at the twisted image in the mirror and uttered weakly, &amp;ldquo;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ll do anything&amp;hellip; if you spare her life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wicked smile crept onto its face, parting its lips to reveal a serpent&amp;rsquo;s tongue. &amp;ldquo;Even after she spurned you so? Wow, that is quite noble of you. I really enjoyed beating her. The shock on her face when,&amp;rdquo; it squatted down to look Norman right in the eyes and made air quotes, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;hellip; flung her against the wall was priceless.&amp;rdquo; Norman flinched when it stood back up and glared down at him. &amp;ldquo;Well, I guess you had to be there,&amp;rdquo; it chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just tell me what I have to do to end this, you&amp;hellip; you&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Monster? Is that the word you&amp;rsquo;re looking for? You sheep are so predictable and unimaginative. You either run away like your simpering wife did or you cower at my feet and beg mercy for your loved ones. It&amp;rsquo;s really quite simple. Come to me and there will be no need for me to come to you. If you make me step out there again I&amp;rsquo;m going to linger.&amp;rdquo; It perversely flicked its tongue side to side. &amp;ldquo;I bet Julie tastes amazing in all the right places.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman vomited on himself, pushed aside the pain in his foot and drowsiness from the exhaust fumes quickly filling the two car garage, and rose to his knees. He grabbed hold of the bottom frame of the mirror to steady himself, closed his eyes, and leaned forward. The glass swiveled upward and smacked him hard in the chin. The unexpected blow opened his eyes wide and loosened his grip enough for the mirror to pull away from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a shudder-inducing creak like the sound his grandma&amp;rsquo;s old rocking chair used to make, it pivoted on its exquisitely carved claw feet, turned, and scurried just out of Norman&amp;rsquo;s reach. An ear splitting cackle echoed through the garage. He turned in a panic and began to crawl towards it. It backed up to the garage door. The glass went black and began to ripple. Like a pebble dropped into a still lake, one ever expanding ring swam outward to make room for another and another and many more like the first until its entire surface was squiggling and wiggling furiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman started to scream as the eel-like thing from his dream began to emerge from the inky black surface of the mirror glass. Countless others began to breach the glass as well until its entire surface was covered in squirming ribbon-like creatures. Their gaping wide maws held row upon row of rings of teeth all spinning clockwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one they shot towards Norman like bullets and embedded themselves in his bare skin. They latched on like lampreys, chewed, and burrowed their way into his flesh. His screaming quieted and then shortly after stopped all together. He lay there no longer twitching as the wriggling things fell limp from his body; all but one. Norman&amp;rsquo;s eyes shot open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norman crawled out of bed the next morning, stretched, and let out a big yawn. He mused to himself that sleep was the best remedy after the long busy day he had yesterday. He grabbed his phone off his dresser and texted Julie, &amp;ldquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t be home until tomorrow. Come get your stuff today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he stepped into the bedroom closet and slid the door shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;li&gt;she looks at us and says &amp;ldquo;wasnt he called Fro or Friej or something?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Ten Miles From Vaughn</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a desolate stretch of road across the wide, open expanse of empty desert. The most remarkable thing about this part of the highway was a single gnarled tree stripped bare of its leaves, branches reaching up like bony fingers into the clear night sky on the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flicked the ash off my cigarette out of the car window, the embers danced like miniature stars in the dark before winking out of existence behind us. Soft classical music poured from the car’s speakers and I took another drag from my cigarette. It was about 4 A.M. and we were determined to get to Arroyo Hondo by dinner time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George had been busy writing his novel and working; we hadn’t had any alone time for a year. Sometime before he finished his novel, I snapped at him about not having any time together and we had an argument. We decided it would be best for us to take a week off for a vacation, which meant no work and no emails from anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How long until we reach Santa Fe, dear?” I asked. The tree, like the embers, faded into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Couple of hours,” George replied. “It’ll be nice to have a warm bed to cuddle up in, wouldn’t it Carl?” We were both dead tired from driving all night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded and put a hand on his thigh. “I’m looking forward to it. At least we will have barely passable hotel coffee instead of shitty gas station coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George chuckled as we drove along the empty highway. We passed a rusted and dirty sign telling us the city of Vaughn was twenty miles away. I heard George’s phone beep and I looked incredulously at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That better not be what I think it is,” I glared over at George.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George shrugged and explained, “I’m waiting to hear back from my agent, I can’t afford to miss an email or a call from her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All you do is work! This trip is supposed to allow us to refocus on each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Carl…” George sighed. “It’s just – what if she calls and I can’t answer, or she emails, and I can’t reply, and I miss a great deal that could launch my career as an author?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There will be another opportunity,” I angrily slammed the cigarette butt into the ashtray. “We agreed this trip was for us to spend time together, alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George sighed again and kept driving, shaking his head. He said nothing. I clenched my jaw and gave George another glare before I turned and stared out my window. &lt;em&gt;Why couldn’t he understand? I just want to spend time with him alone&lt;/em&gt;, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headlights of the car illuminated a solitary candle flickering on the side of the road. I closed my eyes and rested my head against the back of the seat. There was nothing I could say or do when George got like this. I’d just have to stew in silence until he wanted to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glared out the window and saw thunder clouds suddenly rolling in. The music filled the uncomfortable silence for a few moments before a flash of light and a crack of thunder exploded above our car. A loud high-pitched whine exploded from the speakers. I clutched my ears as the car swerved, and my teeth rattled as the car rumble against the shoulder of the road. My eyes shot open, and I saw George covering his ears. I reached out and flicked off the radio, sending us into a blissful silence punctuated with the staccato of thick, heavy raindrops on the roof. George grabbed the steering wheel and jerked the car back onto the road. He turned on the windshield wipers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus! Where did this storm come from?” George rubbed his ears and stared at the radio. “And what the hell was that with the radio?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” I replied. “Maybe we went out of range of the station?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a satellite radio,” George countered with a shake of his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged. “Should we try turning it back on?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George thought a moment before nodding. “It could’ve just been something caused by the lightning &amp;ndash; electrical interference y’know?” I flicked the radio on and once again classical music spilled from the speakers. “Whatever it was, it was weird. With a capital W.” George said nothing, but I could tell he wasn’t as upset as he was a few moments ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed a sign that looked brand new, announcing Vaughn was ten miles away. For a brief moment, the headlights illuminated a small child huddled in a dirty yellow raincoat walking along the side of the road. Then the kid was out of the light as the car rocketed down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a kid out there!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw him.” George slammed on the brakes and the car lurched to a halt. George looked in the rear view, put the car in reverse and pulled up next to the child and honked to get his attention. The kid jumped and looked around wildly. I rolled down the window and noticed he was a small boy. He kept his hands jammed in his armpits, shivering despite the yellow coat. Mud caked the bottom of his jeans and he squinted in the bright light of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey kid! You need a ride?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see he was about ten or eleven years old, his face covered in filth. He peered at me, eyes wild and filled with fright and uncertainty. He looked down the road behind us before looking right back at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh-uh, my mom said I’m not supposed to get in the car with strangers,” the boy stuttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing out here so late?” George asked as he leaned over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kid looked down the road again and back up at us. “I’m trying to get away from the bad man.” Thunder rumbled in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brow creased. Was this kid kidnapped?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s your name kiddo?” George asked as he looked over his shoulder and down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mikey,” the boy replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mikey, did this bad man hurt you?” George leaned in even more, a sure sign he was becoming concerned. Mikey looked down and held out his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah…” he said. I saw the bleeding cigarette burns that covered his hands, as well as twin bruises on his wrists. He jammed his hands back into his armpits immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jesus!” George exclaimed, “Look Mikey, we want to help you. Where does your mom live?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In Vaughn,” he replied gesturing towards the sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George looked at him. “Mikey do you know your address?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our house is right there next to the highway,” Mikey replied. “You won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George nodded. “I’m George and this is Carl. Come on, get in we’ll take you home and then we can get the police to help catch the bad man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave Mikey a reassuring smile, and he shifted uncomfortably for a moment, weighing his options. He nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” he said as he walked up to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George popped the locks and Mikey climbed into the backseat. I became intensely aware that he smelled of motor oil and brake fluid. He carefully buckled in and we drove on. We didn’t have a towel for the boy to wipe his face with, but we did have napkins. I dug a few out of a greasy fast food bag. I twisted in my seat to look at Mikey. He was looking out the window absentmindedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you know what the bad man looks like?” I asked as I handed him napkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, he’s tall. The tallest man I’ve ever seen.” Mikey took the napkins and wiped his face, and I saw the back of his hand was caked in filth and blood with the cigarette burns standing out like beacons. As Mikey continued, I dug around the glove compartment looking for some gauze to cover his wounds. “He wears a black sweater that comes up to his chin and is totally bald. He’s got a beard and wears thick glasses.” No luck on the gauze. Poor kid. Mikey began to pick at a thread on his yellow coat before taking it off. “I also saw his van when I was running away. It’s all black, with a white stuffed horsey tied to the front. I hid under it for a little while and ripped something off, but I don’t really want to talk about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked to George nervously. He merely shrugged. George was better with kids &amp;ndash; his book was a kid’s book after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you have a favorite sport?” George asked. I was grateful for the change in subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah!” Mikey bounced in his seat, ears perked. “I like football! When I grow up, I want to be the best football player ever. It’s why I was able to run so far so fast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George chuckled and smiled. “You did a great job, Mikey. I’ll bet you’ll be the best football player ever. Who is your favorite team?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I like the Baltimore Ravens,” he answered. “Mostly ‘cuz I think their mascot is cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George smiled. “They are pretty cool,” he said with a nod. “What’s your favorite flavor of ice cream?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mikey thought hard on that. “I like chocolate the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smiled at George and I looked at him. His phone chimed again. I frowned as George reached for it, but he checked himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sweetheart…” I began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at me with a shake of his head. It was clear he didn’t want to talk about it in front of Mikey. I sighed and leaned against my door. Another flash of light. Another crack of thunder. Another sharp, high-pitched whine. I winced and turned the radio off. It wasn’t as bad as before, but I decided it best to leave the radio off for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked in the rearview mirror and saw Mikey didn’t even seem to notice the whine. More importantly, I saw a pair of headlights were coming up from behind. &lt;em&gt;Where had they come from?&lt;/em&gt; I wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George didn’t seem to notice. “You alright back there?” he asked Mikey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mhm,” Mikey responded detachedly. “I’m okay, Mister George.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George smiled and turned his attention back to the road and the growing lights of the city. It was a small one-horse, one road, type of town, that much we could tell. Mikey wasn’t wrong when he said we wouldn’t miss his house. The rain started to get worse, the thunder and lightning more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glanced back at him and smiled, then frowned when I saw the car behind gaining on us. It was a black van with a dirty white stuffed horse tied to the grill. The van’s headlights were filthy and vaguely reminded me of two menacing eyes in the rainy dark. “George,” I said, nodding to the mirror. He looked at me then the mirror and nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know,” he said softly. “He’s been there for about a minute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth to say something, but suddenly the car was jolted forward as the van rammed into us. Mikey screamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hold on!” George shouted as he slammed his foot on the gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jerked back, and Mikey whimpered. The van picked up speed and crashed into us again. A blast of thunder split the air as my head slammed on the dashboard and I heard a thump behind me. Despite his seat belt, Mikey must have crashed into the back of my seat. The car swerved off the road and there was a sickening screech of metal on metal as we careened through a guard rail. We hit a ditch and stopped. Everything was silent there was no rain, no thunder. I looked up, and felt a thick wetness creeping down from my forehead. I touched it and saw blood. I looked back at the road and saw the van was nowhere in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mikey?” I called. “George?” I heard George groan next to me and looked at him. There was a huge cut on his forehead, but he was breathing. I looked in the backseat. Mikey wasn’t there. The door was closed, the windows unbroken. The only indication Mikey was ever in our car was the small, wet yellow raincoat thrown across the seat, and the buckled seat belt. The small boy had vanished like he was never there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crawled out of the car and put a hand on it to steady myself, trying to catch my breath. I expected there to be mud, but the ground was as dry as ever. I remembered I needed to check on George. I rushed to George’s side and pulled the door open. “George, tell me you’re alright, sweetheart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m fine, is Mikey okay?” He looked at me bleary eyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I… don’t know,” I replied, “He’s… not in the car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean he’s not in the car! He was just there a moment ago!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s not,” I said, gesturing to the empty back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe he went out a window?” George said hopefully. I shook my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George slumped down in his seat and stared dejectedly out cracked windshield. “He has to be here somewhere,” George straightened his back and scanned the road. “Maybe the man in the van got him again?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up and down the bone-dry road, my eyes straining in the dark for any hint of car lights. “I don’t see the van.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Damn it Carl, that’s not possible,” George crawled from the wreckage and ran to the road. When he didn’t see the van, he shouted, “Cars don’t vanish. People don’t vanish. Not like that. And what about the rain? Where’s the mud? Why is the road dry?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged my shoulders, at a loss for the phantom rain. “Do you see them anywhere?” I stomped over to him and the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No.” George pulled out his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now is not the time to be checking your email,” I reached for his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was checking for reception, Carl,” George sneered as he pulled his phone away. When I stopped reaching for it, he showed me the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No bars?” I was stunned. “But, you just got an email not too long ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is weird as hell,” George pocketed his phone angrily. He put his hand over his face and groaned. “Look &amp;ndash; babe. I’m sorry. I know this trip was for us to spend some time together and I … haven’t been entirely good at that.” He kicked a rock and I watched him, my jaw tightening. “I’m just excited for my book to come out y’know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed and remembered how he dealt with Mikey in the car. George was always good with kids, and writing was his passion. Who was I to take something that important from him? “I’m sorry sweetheart &amp;ndash; I’ve been too hard on you.” I relaxed my jaw and looked out at the city lights just a few more miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I understand &amp;ndash; let’s talk about this later okay? Right now, I think we need to focus on finding Mikey and getting our car fixed.” George embraced me, and I held him tightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The town is only a few more miles away,” I pulled back and pointed down the highway. “We can organize a search party and try to find him, and hopefully find a mechanic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George nodded and walked away from the wreckage. It looked salvageable, but we were going to need a tow truck to get it out of there. We walked for about two hours to the city, and by the time we got there, the sun already started to rise. In the cold, grey, dawn light George spotted a man in a pair of denim overalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey! Mister!” George shouted and waved his arms. The man turned to us. He was an older man, skin like worn out leather, freckles dotting his cheeks like splotches of ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can I help you, son?” he asked with a Southwestern drawl that made every word seem to lounge on the tip of a lazy tongue. He had a friendly smile on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My husband and I picked up a kid about ten miles away and we got run off the road by some crazy guy in a black van,” George explained. The old man’s smile turned to a frown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where’s the kid?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know,” George explained, “We were kinda hoping you could help us find him. He seems to be from around here. He said his name was Mikey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man’s face went pale as a sheet. “Can’t be. Lil’ Mikey’s been dead for about three months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was George who frowned. “No. He hasn’t,” he argued, “We just picked him up. He was wearing a yellow coat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man shook his head. “Son, I don’t know what kind of sick game you’re playing at, but the boy was found dead about fifteen miles away. There’s a candle marking the spot. Some sicko tortured him – burned his hands with cigarettes. Doc says he died of exposure after escaping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at George and he looked back at me. “That’s what the boy said happened,” I explained, “We saw his hands. He even described the man who did it to him. Tall, bald, and in a black sweater. The car that drove us off the road was a big black van with a white horse tied to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man scratched his head. “I do remember a van like that coming into town every few weeks, and the man who was driving it also matched your description. But here’s the thing. He was involved in a fatal crash the night before Lil’ Mikey was found. Took out our ten-mile sign when he lost control of his van. Flipped into a ditch and he was thrown from it to his death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any idea what caused him to lose control?” I had my suspicions but wanted to hear it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man nodded. “Yeah, looks like somebody ripped or cut his brake line.” George and I looked at each other in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned my attention back to the old man. “Did you know him?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man nodded. “Not personally, he was one of the guys who lives out in the desert. We saw some weird shit in his house – hundreds of cigarette butts discarded next to two sets of half unlocked handcuffs. When we found Lil’ Mikey with all those cigarette burns on his hands… we put two and two together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George shook his head and muttered “Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man sighed. “You say you got run off the road by a van after picking up a kid in a yellow raincoat?” He looked out across the empty stretch of the desert just outside the city limits. “I believe it. I’ve seen some things out in the desert that I can’t explain. Lights in the sky, wailing women. Once I even saw a car that I thought had already left town drive through here a second time.” He turned back to us and asked, “Where’s your car? I’ve got a tow truck and run the local repair garage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About five miles the way we came,” I gestured down the highway. “Do you want us to go with you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man nodded. “Yeah, may as well. That way I can tell you the bill then and there.” We climbed into his tow truck and he drove us back out to the wreck, where he pulled the car from the ditch. It wasn’t too badly damaged, but it would need some repair. The man said it was going to be a couple hundred dollars at most. As he was hooking up the car, I stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to check something,” I said as I headed to the backdoor. I opened the door Mikey entered and looked inside. It was just as I thought, there was no yellow raincoat thrown over the seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventy years of life, I&amp;rsquo;d thought I&amp;rsquo;d seen everything. Turns out, no matter how long &amp;lsquo;ya get in the tooth, life can still throw you for a loop. My name&amp;rsquo;s Dale, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got one hell of a tall tale for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of every month, me and a couple of hunting buddies head out into the woods to bag some varmints. &amp;lsquo;Ya can&amp;rsquo;t hunt deer out of season, but nobody cares if a few squirrels get fragged. The hunting party consists of me, my buddy Jim from West Virgina. He&amp;rsquo;s a nice guy, but about as sharp as a turnip. There&amp;rsquo;s Hank, he&amp;rsquo;s so big he could lift me over his head with one hand. There&amp;rsquo;s Jack, who&amp;rsquo;s such a nice guy you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe he&amp;rsquo;s been in prison twice, and lastly there&amp;rsquo;s Buddy. That ain&amp;rsquo;t his real name, its actually &amp;ldquo;Dale.&amp;rdquo; But my name is Dale, hence the nickname, &amp;ldquo;Buddy.&amp;rdquo; He&amp;rsquo;s a shut-in and kind of a weirdo, but the sweetest guy you&amp;rsquo;ll ever meet. He owns a couple pet rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guys are like family to me I&amp;rsquo;ve been hunting with them so long. Even when things get rough, we love spending time together. A few weeks ago we all ran into some serious trouble, and none of us will ever forget it. My father used to say &amp;ldquo;A bad day hunting beats the hell outta a good day working.&amp;rdquo; But if he lived to see a night like this, he&amp;rsquo;d never say that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can remember the day it all happened like a movie. While most days, the woods are so full of runts that it seems like the ground was made of &amp;rsquo;em, this was as dry as the desert after a fire. For a hunting party of five people, we&amp;rsquo;d nabbed about six critters all together before sundown. It was downright depressing. Of course, we might have just been depressed because of the weather. It was like a funeral march out there. Pitch black, thick gray clouds with no rain, and no animal life in sight. It was like Mother Nature had a heart attack and went into a coma. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t even count the stars to pass time, on account of all the clouds. It was like the man in the moon forgot to pay the electric bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there we all were, demoralized, demotivated and just plain de-sappointed. We&amp;rsquo;re all sitting around a campfire burning our way through the alcohol we hoped we&amp;rsquo;d be saving to celebrate our glorious victory, telling tall tales and bad jokes to try to cheer ourselves up. The night was dead as a jackrabbit in a bear cave. The woods were so quiet you could sneeze and they&amp;rsquo;d hear it for miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a night as dead, dreary and quiet as this one, it was the perfect time to tell some scary stories. We let Jack go first. His stories were the best because, being a character of questionable standing, they&amp;rsquo;d always be messed up, violent and terrifying. Which is just the way we like &amp;rsquo;em! Jack had a great story for us that night, the story of &amp;ldquo;The Rat King.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when I first heard him say &amp;ldquo;Rat King&amp;rdquo; I just pictured a giant rat. But the real thing is a whole lot different than that. See, supposedly what happens is a large group of rats living out of a nest get all this gunk and filth (and shit, don&amp;rsquo;t forget shit) in their fur and on their tails, and they start to get stuck together. Their tails get tangled, their fur sticks together, and no matter how much they struggle and fight, they can never escape. By the time people find &amp;rsquo;em, their dead bodies are all clumped together in a fossilized lump. They spend so long stuck to each other that their skin kind of melts and heals together until their bodies have sort of melted through, like a Siamese twin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a terrifying tale, perfect to tell in the middle of the night when everybody&amp;rsquo;s half-drunk. But Buddy, being an actual rat owner, pointed out a few discrepancies with the story. Firstly rats apparently groom themselves as much as cats. Makes sense rats and cats are so similar, since their names rhyme. Like any prey animal, they groom themselves so their smell doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand out to predators, and so all that gunk doesn&amp;rsquo;t slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing is, as dumb as rats are, they aren&amp;rsquo;t completely stupid. If their tail gets caught in something, they&amp;rsquo;ll chew it off. Like how a fox chews off its own leg in a bear trap. Sure, it ain&amp;rsquo;t the smartest means of self-preservation since they&amp;rsquo;ll probably bleed out five minutes after they escape, but it&amp;rsquo;s a much quicker death than slowly melting into a pile of corpses. Still, despite those glaring, oozing plotholes, we all agreed it was a damn good story. An hour or two later, we were all gettin&amp;rsquo; tired and ready to hit the hay. So, all five of us crawled into our individual tents, put the fire out and tried to get some shut-eye before the four-hour commute we&amp;rsquo;d have to take in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the middle of the night, I woke up to the sound of one of some kind of horrible screaming. As I shuffled out of my tent, I saw everyone else was waking up too. Nobody was quite sure what it was. We knew it was some kind of animal, but after forty years of hunting, I&amp;rsquo;d never heard anything like it. It was kind of like a large bird mixed with an angry dog. Sounded like some weird animal remix or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and the boys figured it must be coming from one of the traps. The first couple we checked had absolutely nothing in &amp;rsquo;em. But the last one&amp;ndash;hoo boy!&amp;ndash;it had something in it alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dark, it looked like a confused, shambling mess. We thought for a minute that a rodent must have gotten trapped under some mud or something. When we shined our flashlights on the thing, we wished we stayed ignorant. It was a big, muscular rodent about as big as a small dog. It had large, razor-sharp antlers like an antelope, it had piercing red eyes that seemed to glow in the night, and the damn thing looked like a zombie with the way it was wasting away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the worst thing about it were the holes on its back. Large, gaping, covered in pus. For a moment there, we thought whatever this weird thing was had gotten into an accident and was maimed until he saw what was coming out of those holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny little things, we almost thought they were giant insects, but upon closer inspection, they looked like little naked mole rats. Eerily smooth, bright pink, covered in a layer of muck, they looked like they had no eyes. I saw one that only had a single tooth, already chipped and yellow right out of the womb. They were ferociously chewing and clawing their way out of the holes, tearing open the flash like they were ripping through paper and causing tiny little puddles of blood to pool up around them. The creature seemed to scream in pain and as it wrapped its chipped, yellow claws on the outside of the cage. The little beasts were just small enough that they could slip through the holes in the cages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ran around at our feet making little squeaking noises. Understandably, we were just a little tiny itty-bit fucking terrified, so we jumped all around screaming like idiots and shooting our guns at nothing in particular. This made the freak scream and hiss even more. I guess it was protective of its kind, or maybe it was just scared of the loud noises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had a look on its face that could give a mortician nightmares. So angry, so hateful, seething in rage. Its mangled teeth clenched as hard as it could manage, spittle and bile flowing down its face. It was easily the most disgusting thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hank wanted to shoot it right away, but me and Buddy stopped him. Jim waddled over to a nearby tree and started puking his guts out, poor guy. We figured we could turn it into a science lab or the humane society and get a reward or help them discover a new species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us had any clue what the hell it was. It didn&amp;rsquo;t look like anything natural. Jack thought it might have been mutated by toxic waste, but Buddy pointed out that toxic waste would probably just kill you. I said it might be some kind of government experiment like those things on Plum Island. Even Jim, that ol&amp;rsquo; knucklehead had a theory or two. Apparently, he saw this thing on the animal planet where these underwater frogs, &amp;ldquo;Suriname Sea Toads&amp;rdquo; give birth to their kids by spewing them outta their backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since none of us had a name for it, we decided to dub it after the story Jack told last night. &amp;ldquo;The Rat King.&amp;rdquo; Now, since it was giving birth, it was probably a female whatever-it-was, but Buddy pointed out that maybe the female could lay eggs in the male&amp;rsquo;s back. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t care to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got Jim to get the truck back it up to where the trap was. All of us surrounded the cage, making sure that if that freaky thing escaped, we could easily catch it. Me and Hank grabbed both ends of the cage (it was specially designed so you can pick it up without getting bit or scratched) and we tried to lug that thing into the back. Once we were done, I&amp;rsquo;d drive us home, Jim would sit next to me, and the other guys would sit in the back. Buddy, of course, would sit in the middle. Poor guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something went horribly wrong. Another rat erupted from that thing, and it scurried down Hank&amp;rsquo;s leg. He screamed and dropped his end of the cage, and the thing broke out. Everyone was in a panic, running around like nitwits with no clear goal in mind. I was the biggest nitwit of the bunch, because I tried to grab the damn thing with my bare hands and it bit me in the arm. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been bit by plenty of animals before, but nothing like this. It was like two sledgehammers smashing a bunch of nails down into my skin. I screamed so loud it nearly tore my vocal cords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing jumped out of my grasp and I went down in pain. The other guys started shooting at it as it sped away. Jim and Buddy managed to tag the sucker in the leg and shoulder. It let out a shriek that could break glass as it jumped into a nearby stream. It sank right to the bottom, perhaps swimming down on purpose. As it disappeared upstream, it left a trail of green blood. The only evidence it had ever been near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rolled up my sleeve and observed the wound. It looked like it was already infected, with the opening and the veins near it glowing green. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much of what happened afterward because I fainted, but I heard some chatter about dumping peroxide on the wound and getting me to the hospital, and then it all went dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought for sure I was gonna turn into a zombie, or at least lose my arm. Turns out, a little antiseptic and some bed rest can work wonders. I spend about four weeks in the hospital and was discharged only a few days ago. The wound hasn&amp;rsquo;t completely healed up yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting much better. The doctors say I had some kind of poison similar to something a spider or a rattlesnake would spit out in me, but they managed to fix it right up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad I lived through that ordeal, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help feeling a bit depressed we didn&amp;rsquo;t catch that thing. Now, nobody would believe our story. It was just another tall tale told by a bunch of hunters who were so drunk at the time they could light a fire by coughing. A great story to tell to friends, but nothing concrete to prove anything to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, none of us are sure if the Rat King we caught actually died or managed to survive. It certainly looked like it&amp;rsquo;d been through worse, after all. Once I&amp;rsquo;m healed up and the 15th of next month rolls around, me and the gang will be out in those same woods, hunting like nothing ever happened. If we find that thing again, it&amp;rsquo;ll be a damned miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just hope that whatever that thing was, it was the only one of its kind. God help us if there are more out there.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Only Following Orders</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story you are about to read is one that has been, for the last 70 years, left to wither in the hearts of those few who recall it. Of the twelve of us present that day, only I remain, and my own end is rapidly approaching. I write this tale with shaky hand solely in order to console myself in my final moments, and I hope anyone who may discover this document will refrain from judgement upon me or my comrades until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I distinctly recall sitting in a tent with my fellow soldiers just outside of Berlin, huddling around a shortwave radio and listening to the trials of our nation’s greatest foes. They feigned insanity, pled guilty, gave harrowing accounts of every detail and every single crime committed by their hand or under their watch. My favorites, however, were the ones who pled innocent; the ones who said, “I was just following orders”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to wonder what I would say, had the war ended with Moscow under the iron eagle. What would I say, if asked to justify my actions in war? I believe I know exactly what I would say, and it would be the same as the men being jeered by the entire Red Army - excluding the ten of us gathered in the tent. You see, the two luckiest of us had already died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a quiet village in eastern Germany, December 24th, 1944. We were under orders to seek out any soldiers lying in wait to ambush the main column of the Army. Our sergeant, Ivan, took the lead, the rest of us falling in behind him. It was raining heavily, obscuring our vision. A sharp crack jerked me to attention, and I immediately fell to my stomach. I smelled smoke and heard a thump in the dirt a dozen feet ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound of gunfire roared in my ears as we returned fire. We had no idea where the shot had come from, so each among us took our best guess and fired in that direction. We knew we would not hit the shooter, but we had hoped to scare him off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to hold my fire in order to cover my comrades as they reloaded their weapons. When the gunfire stopped, I watched carefully the nearby houses. A quick movement by a roadside fence caught my eye, and I quickly shot off a couple rounds at the dark mass. At least one of my shots must’ve landed, because whatever it was fell to the ground, unmoving. By now, my fellow soldiers had finished reloading, and so I ejected my magazine and slid a new one in its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were still for some time, waiting for the returning fire. When it never came, Ivan came up to a crouch and quietly walked over to the corpse. He felt the pulse, and then returned to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, we got him,” he said. In his eyes, I saw something I hadn’t seen before; a kind of deep sadness and regret. No matter how I pushed, he would not tell me why. We stood, and casually walked over to the house where the shooter had come from. Ivan knocked on the door. We waited a moment, and Ivan firmly planted his foot on the floor, rearing to kick the door down, when a shotgun blast blew through the door. Ivan fell to the ground, riddled with buckshot. We returned fire through the door, then swiftly beat it down with the stock of our rifles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside, broken glass littered the floor and bulletholes scattered along the walls. On the ground was a young woman, shot fatally four times. In her hand, the shotgun that killed Ivan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had had more than enough of this village. We ransacked the house, throwing over tables and filling our pockets with valuables. When we had finished, we threw gas lamps onto the floor and tossed matches on the pooling liquid. We left the house on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only once we were outside again that we heard the wailing. By then, the flames had taken hold, and it was too late to reenter the building. The mother had hidden her babe, before turning to fight us, and we hadn’t found it before torching the house. The wails continued for just a few minutes before falling silent among the crackling of flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man burst from a building down the street and sprinted toward us, screaming in German. Our translator gaped at him, and when we raised our rifles, he held up his hand to stop us. The German man shoved past us and up to the burning building. He hesitated only briefly at the doorway before running through. He didn’t come back out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the fire had died, we couldn’t see it anymore. The rest of our mission went by in silence. When we doubled back to where we came, we found people standing in the street, staring at us. Some were angry, some sad, but most had just a blank stare. I still see it in my nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we passed the house, I stopped. I announced to no one in particular that I had to take a leak. No one believed it, but that didn’t matter. I stepped into the shell of the house we had destroyed. There, on the floor in the bedroom, I saw the skeleton of a man crushed under a wooden beam, a smaller collection of misshapen bones in his arms. In the yard, by the fence, I saw a little boy with a toy gun, dressed in the oversized uniform of a German soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, we all had nightmares. The man, with his wild eyes, told each of us that he would be back for us, one after the other. The next day, we had laughed it off together, we had thrown ourselves into our duties, we had fought hard not to think about the screaming man and the wailing baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one, as the years went by, we died. Here, one of us fell from a tower we were constructing; there, an aggressive form of cancer that suddenly appeared in the brain. Never obvious, but always suspicious to us, because we knew. We all knew what was happening. When there were two of us, just Ioseph and I, he had come to visit me. When he had knocked, I thought my time had come; but I should’ve known I would be last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s coming for me,” Ioseph had said. “It is my time now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would’ve liked to console him, to assure him it was all a coincidence, but we both knew better. That night, Ioseph cried on my shoulder, and I on his. “I’m so sorry,” he had sobbed. “I didn’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, he shot himself in his apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was one week ago, and now it is my turn. I know he is coming; every night in my sleep he gazes into my eyes, and smiles. Every night, he smiles wider. Last night, he began to speak. Quietly, so quiet I cannot hear any of what he says, other than make out that he is speaking. I don’t want to hear what he has to say; I cannot sleep tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will stay up as late as possible, and before I sleep I will climb to the roof and stand on the edge. I must. I cannot know what he will say. The shot at us, the woman killed Ivan; we couldn’t have known about the baby, we were just eliminating the resistance, that’s all! We were only following orders!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only following orders&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Public Restroom</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was late, right around 8:00 P.M. For November this meant that the shadows of the night were already engulfing the world. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t cold out though. The wind was gentle and carried with it the smells of foliage thanks to the various gardens that littered the campus grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sauntered along the sidewalks while admiring the weather. I loved the night, especially when the stars were out. Unfortunately they couldn&amp;rsquo;t be seen from here even on the clearest of nights since the college was located just outside the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friendly squirrel suddenly crossed my path, coming mere inches to my feet before looking up at me and chattering as though I had done it a misdeed. It didn&amp;rsquo;t appear frightened at all so in a sudden motion I stomped at it. The creature, rather than skittering off, lay flat on the ground. I felt that I could possibly kneel down and pick up the creature had I wanted to. However I had been attending this campus for months and knew from experience that the little thing would run off just sort of contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead I continued on my way. I had a destination in mind and could not be delayed any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ahead along the outer edge of the campus was the only women&amp;rsquo;s restroom left open at this hour. The campus itself usually shuts down early on Fridays so I was lucky there was at least one left unlocked, especially considering I had an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive home ahead of me. Quite honestly I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like stopping at a gas station for such a purpose this late in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning the last building I finally arrived at the lonely structure. It could have served as a concrete outhouse in my opinion, but then again I have no knowledge of such things. It was just a small building with a single purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked behind me as a gust of wind caught my attention. The parking lot was a few yards away, surrounded by the flat green lawn of the college. The campus buildings themselves were dark and shadowed, most of which were no longer holding classes at this time. When I saw no one there I continued on my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door screamed in protest as I entered, rust covered hinges flaking away in a flurry. The sound reverberated in the small room. As was normal for bathrooms the floor was linoleum, the walls a bare white and a single yellow light illuminated the six stalls aligning the back wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were only two sinks and a single roll of paper towels hanging above a trash bin. I passed by and as per usual chose the stall beside the handicapped. I always felt bad whenever I entered the handicapped stall since it was designed for those who had trouble using the regular toilets. When I was younger I took delight in the more spacious stall, but now I knew better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of popular belief, women&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; restrooms don&amp;rsquo;t exactly smell better than the men&amp;rsquo;s room. For various reasons it always smelled worse. I would know. In high school I had once been dared to enter every men&amp;rsquo;s room on campus. I did of course, being the dare devil I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it smelled worse. As though something had died and been left to rot in the small hanging trash box along one of the stall walls. Knowing the sorts of things that would have normally been thrown in there I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the urge to investigate and set my mind to finishing my business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I was finished that I heard it. A slight gasping sound, as though someone with asthma was in the stall beside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having heard anyone enter the restroom I did the immature thing and looked. I leaned forward and tilted my head until I could see under the wall to my left, allowing me to peer into the four stalls beside mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything. They were all empty, so I figured the sound was probably coming from the handicapped stall beside me. Before I could turn my head however I noticed a pair of legs drop down from the stall at the far end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized someone had been standing on the toilet in the first stall. The legs were bare, probably meaning the owner had on a dress or shorts. As for the missing shoes, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t certain. People don&amp;rsquo;t just wander the city shoeless. Not that I knew of anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relieved at finding the culprit I sighed and closed my eyes, ready to sit up and leave when something else happened. A head popped down from the last stall, obviously belonging to the same person as the legs, although something had seemed off about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seemed to be a brunette with wild, unkempt hair. Her skin was very pale, as though she hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen the light of day in years. The features on her face were more prominent, thin and shadowed. She looked rather young to be attending college, maybe a high school freshman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way her cheeks and eyes were unnaturally sunken in. Her eyes however appeared to be pure black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I was four stalls away from her and making all kinds of judgment calls on the girl when I realized I had just been caught peeping at her. This was rather embarrassing so I immediately sat up blushing furiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I apologize? Do people do that in public restrooms? And what about her eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shrugged off the last question, figuring it was just a figment of my imagination. They probably only looked that way because she was so far down that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see her properly. She most likely had some really dark brown eyes or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood, prepared to leave the stall and promptly walk my embarrassment off when I heard something else. Something&amp;hellip;Unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a shuffling sound, as though someone was sliding under the stall walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end realizing how strange this situation had become. Why would she be climbing under the stalls? Was she autistic and lost? That certainly would explain her appearance. Maybe she wandered away from her guardian and decided to play in the women&amp;rsquo;s restroom? It was never locked after all, even after hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I&amp;rsquo;d call the police and report her in case she was a missing person. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want to scare her off since she looked sickly and the poor thing was probably starving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, resolving myself I sat back down and leaned over, only to find the girl looking at me from one stall closer. I originally was going to try and get her name but stopped dead as my eyes took in the sight of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her eyes were black alright. Black as coal. Her skin was pale and cracked in places as though it had dried up and no longer held a drop of moisture. Her throat, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice before, had what looked like a slit along it with some sort of dried darkened residue along the edges. However I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make out the rest of her since it was only her head peeping out from under the stall. I could not identify the rest but at that point I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing wasn&amp;rsquo;t human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear gripped me as I sat up. My nerves were put on edge and my breath had begun to quicken. I had felt as though my heart would pound right out of my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had tried to run out of the bathroom I would have had to run past that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I closed my eyes as images of it leaping upon me and tearing me to shreds started to fill my head. How could I get past it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long I had sat there panicking, but I did notice when it started moving again. Although this time I heard thumping sounds, as though it were hitting the walls gently. My heart beat skyrocketed as I had tried to remain calm, happy to have already done my business. For a moment I considered just running past it. It was my only chance since I had no other options. Then I realized something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to strain my ears to locate the creature by sound but heard nothing. The gasping noises were gone and I no longer heard the thing shuffling or banging along the floors and walls. Was it still there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I had to look. There was a chance that it was standing by the exit now. Or worse, it could be just outside my stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to make my mind up quickly as I contemplated the possibilities. Eventually I ‘manned&amp;rsquo; up and took one last look under the stalls. I glanced to the left to find the thing missing. So, having unconsciously held my breath I glanced towards the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wave of relief washed over me in time for a shuffling sound to my right to catch my attention. Before I could process what it was I whipped my head around, fearing it to be staring back at me just inches away from the stall I never bothered to inspect, only to find a pair of hiking boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a moment to register this. There was someone in the handicapped stall. When did they get here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh who cared? There was someone else there with me! And although I had no idea who this other person was, in the wake of that&amp;hellip;Thing&amp;hellip;I felt at ease knowing I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone anymore.
As usual my sense of relief was short lived once I noticed the gasping sound coming from inside my stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I froze for what seemed like an eternity before I managed to glance up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There she was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blast of fetid air washed over me, much stronger than the original stench from before. Her face was contorted in anger. Her wild hair was knotted up and flying about her head as those dark pits sneered into my very soul. Her mouth was molded into a fierce grimace, cracking her lips and revealing rotted teeth. It was then, while looking into that monsters eyes that I came to a revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hungry, and it wanted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That thought was the only motivation I needed to make a bolt for it. I slammed so hard into the stall door that the lock broke clean off as I stormed through the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to run to my car, to drive home, to curl up in my bed and pretend it was all a bad dream, and I would have if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the girl I nearly ran into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We nearly collided but I managed to swerve out of her path just in time. This girl was wearing a rather trendy mini jacket, slightly torn jeans and a white tank top. She gave me a strange look before going into the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have said something, maybe warned her of what awaited in there. But as I stood, once more straining my ears to hear the slightest of sounds, silence fell upon me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more moments and I began to piece everything together. Realization flooded my thoughts as things began to make sense. Whoever was in the handicapped stall must have had their feet pulled up when I first walked in. They were probably recording the sounds, hoping for screams. Or worse, they were filming me in the stall. The other girl was probably some really well dressed actor who was there to scare the crap out of any poor soul who wandered in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well screw them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned on my heels and hurried to my car, cell already out. I informed the police of the dirt bag who had been filming me in the stalls. I knew that filming anyone in the bathroom, prank or no, was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said they&amp;rsquo;d look into it and I was able to drive home, worry free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh how I regretted that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I arrived on campus only to find it locked down and swarming with cop cars and officers. A girl had been murdered in the women&amp;rsquo;s restroom last night. Estimated time of death, 8:34 P.M. It was the girl I had run into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently there had been a series of murders in the city. A man had been spotted on some of the sites leaving the women&amp;rsquo;s restrooms where the girls were found. He would apparently wait in the handicapped stalls until the girls headed for the sink to wash their hands, then he would come out from behind them and slit their throats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever that thing was in the bathroom, it had saved me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl stood up and brushed her hair out of her face. For some reason, even taking into consideration how terrifying she should have been to David, there was something oddly&amp;hellip; normal about the girl. She had shoulder length brown hair, and was skinny as a rail with a few specs of freckles across her nose and cheeks. Even her clothes could have been found in any store: black tank top and jeans tucked into black-red boots. She was older than he first thought, as well. Closer to sixteen - if she even had an age. A hum from behind them startled them both, and dragged David back into his current situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to go,” she said. “Now.” And the girl grabbed his hand and took off. Surprised, David followed and nearly dropped his phone. He tried to hold it up as far as he could to light the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No need,” the girl raised her free hand in front of her as she spoke, “I got it.” She mumbled something under breath, something that couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been English, and a glowing light pulsated in front of them and followed. It was like a spot light from above was following their movements. The hum from behind was getting louder as they approached the first fork in the tunnel. Without hesitation, the girl veered them over to the right. Clearly she knew where she was going, and David wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to argue. After a moment, the humming stopped, and they stood in front of a ladder leading up into darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just up here!” And the girl began to climb the ladder before them. David snapped back into reality, and he was incredibly confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl stopped mid climb and looked over her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, I know this is weird-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No. No, I know what weird is. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen weird. Who are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;ll explain soon, okay? We just really kinda need to get out of here, okay? No one is supposed to be here and we, well, are. So&amp;mdash;” And with that, the girl returned to her climb. David was about to retort, but the hum from behind grew louder. Survival outweighed understanding at that point, and David grabbed the ladder and followed the girl, leaving that tunnel hopefully for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ladder lead the pair into an empty room. It almost looked like a huge broom closet. A few scattered buckets and mops were lining the walls, but for being a part of the house, it was very unassuming. The girl next to him shook herself off and shoved her hand toward David. Her mood swings were clearly something to be impressed with, and David reluctantly took her hand and shook it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering who I am, and why I know you.” The girl didn&amp;rsquo;t even wait for David to respond. “My name is Natalie, and this is sort of my house.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What are you talking about? How is this your house? This fucking place is your house?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know, I know, but you have to understand what happened. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always like this, it&amp;mdash;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what the hell&amp;mdash;what was that thing you did? With the light down there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I know - this is all a part of it. It all relates, just let me explain.” Natalie paused and looked at David. He closed his mouth and looked back at her, letting her know she was now free to talk without interruption. “This is my house. I know it may seem like hell right now, and you&amp;rsquo;re right. It is. My family kind of dealt in some weird stuff. We moved into this house about ten years ago, and it was nice. A small, quaint place, yeah, considering I&amp;rsquo;m used to the city&amp;mdash;but it was nice. The problem is, my family, we&amp;hellip;can do things. Witches, I guess.” Natalie kind of laughed at the thought. “Mostly just parlor tricks, like that light show you saw in the tunnels. But some of us, like my brother, took it a bit too far. He started to mess with some dark dealings&amp;mdash;demons and summonings and the like. I mean, summoning isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; bad. I can summon a cat, for instance, which is kind of cute but what my brother dealt with was far worse. We would try and tell him to end it, but the power was kind of getting to him. Peter was never one to listen to reason.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&amp;hellip;Peter?” The ideas was circling David&amp;rsquo;s head, but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready to accept it. Peter had been his friend for years&amp;hellip; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This one night, seven years ago, my brother took it too far. Summoning demons for a few minutes here and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for him anymore, he needed more. We would ask him why he was so obsessed with all this, and he would only respond by asking, &amp;lsquo;Why not?&amp;rsquo; What happened over the next few nights&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s kind of hard to talk about it.” Even with her blacked out eyes, David could tell this memory really pained the young girl. All of this&amp;mdash;this hell&amp;mdash;was because of her brother, his friend. It seemed to David that this girl was just as much a prisoner as he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alright,” David said, putting a hand on her shoulder, “then let&amp;rsquo;s get you out of here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David took a look at his surroundings. His heart jumped slightly as he glanced around. Aside from the hatch in the floor they just entered through, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any other exit. Just smooth cement walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you know where we are?” He asked the girl, hoping to God she had some idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, of course,” she said, with a bit too much hesitation for David&amp;rsquo;s liking. “It&amp;rsquo;s my house, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?” And with that she made her way over to one of the far walls. The surface of the wall was a smooth brushed gray cement. There was no way through, no door, nothing. Natalie reached into her pocket and took out what looked to be a small piece of artist&amp;rsquo;s charcoal. She pressed it to the wall and began to draw a long, swooping line about three feet in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line after line followed, and David watched in awe as the girl stood back and admired her work. David had never seen anything like it outside of fantasy movies. It was like a yin yang mixed with a pentagram mixed with a child&amp;rsquo;s doodle. Natalie placed the charcoal back into her pocket and ran her fingers through her hair. After a moment of silence, she raised her hand and placed her right palm against the symbol, resting two fingers against her temple with the other. At first David thought she was speaking to him, but then realized that she was chanting her weird language again. Soon the symbol seemed to be vibrating, and David watched on as it began to steadily glow a deep purple. Natalie smiled to herself as she felt the wall shake before it split in two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved doing that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents died in a car crash when I was fourteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad for me or anything. I&amp;rsquo;ve made my peace with that years ago. Life with them was never great, but I do miss them. It&amp;rsquo;s just that if they taught me one thing, it&amp;rsquo;s to not sit around wallowing in self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wish they hadn&amp;rsquo;t sent me to live with my Aunt Louise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have that one family member that&amp;rsquo;s just a little strange, a little cut off from the rest of the family? Aunt Louise was ours. She was also our closest living relative. Dad&amp;rsquo;s family lived on the other side of the continent. Mom&amp;rsquo;s parents were both dead and she was an only child. Aunt Louise, her mother&amp;rsquo;s sister actually, so my great-aunt, lived just an hour from where we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my folks were alive, we rarely visited Aunt Louise, and to be perfectly honest, I half expected her to refuse to house me. I was fully prepared to become a ward of the state, or move across the country, as soon as I heard that Children and Family services had contacted her about taking me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she accepted. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how willingly, or graciously, because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t privy to the phone conversation where she agreed to take me. I was surprised, though, at how nice she was to me the first three days I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make something clear; while Aunt Louise was cranky, odd, eccentric, uncouth, and several other less-than-flattering adjectives, she wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete bitch. She had a rather abrupt, even abrasive, way of speaking, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t cruel. I had never taken the time to really get to know her during my initial fourteen years, but I could tell that she mostly kept to herself and didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like people, so naturally I assumed that she was a reclusive, curmudgeonly bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, what surprised me most when I first moved in was how &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; everything seemed. At least at first. Aunt Louise cooked, cleaned, watched TV, talked to neighbors on the phone, etc., just like anyone else would, and she told me right away that she had little in the way of expectations from me. Or at least, none that my parents wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have; don&amp;rsquo;t stay out too late, let her know if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be late coming home, finish your homework before you watch TV, clean up after yourself, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one rule, however, that was strange. And it stood out from the other rules in how strange it was. At first, I tried not to worry about it; old people sometimes have peculiarities. I initially thought that was all this was. I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She insisted that any time I entered or left a room, I was to shut the door behind me right away. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter if I was only going to be in that room for a few seconds. If I entered a room, I was expected to &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; shut the door, and the same was true if I left it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often forgot this rule in my first week or so there. She never failed to remind me of it. &amp;ldquo;Shut that damned door!&amp;rdquo; she would yell, any time I forgot. It never seemed to matter where she was in the house, she could always tell when I had not shut a door just after opening it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her house was old, and my understanding is that she was not its first owner. She had lived in it since Mom was a girl. I had no idea how old it was. It could easily have been over a hundred, judging by its design and layout. It had two floors, a basement and a sub-basement. That last floor threw me for a bit of a loop when I discovered it existed. I was washing a load of my clothes when I noticed a door, closed, naturally, in the far wall of the utility room. The basement was unfinished, with mostly dirt flooring and bits and bobs stacked or piled or shelved everywhere. The only room you could really walk through without fear of stepping on something or knocking over a stack or pile was this laundry room, which was also the only tiled floor down there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door I found in the basement had a board laid across it, easily moveable. It was as if Aunt Louise wanted a border there but not one that she couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past, if need be. My curiosity overtook me the second time I saw it - I slid the board away from the door and tried it. It was locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn&amp;rsquo;t strike me as all that strange right away. That is, until I realized that this was the only room in the house, other than the doors leading outside, that Aunt Louise kept locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked her about it one day. She was cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The door in the basement?&amp;rdquo; she answered. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the sub-basement. Not much down there. I mainly keep my preserves down there. It&amp;rsquo;s cool enough for them to keep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right,&amp;rdquo; I answered. This didn&amp;rsquo;t really explain why she kept it locked. &amp;ldquo;So if I ever wanted to take a look around down there&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the love of Christ, boy, why would you want to do that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed with that response that her face had changed. Aunt Louise mostly wore the same expression; a scowl like someone had just tracked mud onto her freshly-shampooed carpet. Again, she wasn&amp;rsquo;t as nasty as her expression indicated, but it was the expression she was most used to making, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when she responded to my desire to see what was behind that door, her eyebrows raised and her mouth quivered for just a second before answering. It was so slight, others might not have noticed it, but by that time, I knew enough about Aunt Louise to equate that with a scream of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew then that I had to see what was behind that door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a curious type, you see. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been able to stay away from something that aroused my curiosity, even if my good sense told me better. I wanted nothing more after that than to see what was in that sub-basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how was I to get around the lock? That was going to be an issue. Aunt Louise kept all her keys on a single ring. There weren&amp;rsquo;t that many of them, but I figured if the door to that sub-basement was anywhere, it was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just had to find a way to take it from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out not to be so simple. For one thing, it was not possible to get around the house without being heard. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sneak from my bedroom to hers in order to sneak the keys without opening and closing all doors in between us; mine, the door in the far part of the hallway, and hers. Believe me, even if I simply left all doors open, she somehow knew. I once had to go to the bathroom in the night, and I forgot to close the hallway door. I had just made it to the bathroom when I heard her yell, even while asleep, &amp;ldquo;Shut that damned door!&amp;rdquo; I hurriedly turned back and went to close the hallway door, forgetting to close the bathroom door, and I heard it again: &amp;ldquo;Shut that damned door!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that matter, Aunt Louise&amp;rsquo;s room had a squeaky door that also had a catch to it, so when she opened it, it sounded like a &lt;em&gt;choom&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;creeeeeeeeeeeeak&lt;/em&gt;. There was no opening her door without her noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I forgot about the sub-basement door for a while. I placed my curiosity on the back burner and just tried to get along with the taciturn old woman for a while. Life got a bit easier. As long as I remembered to keep all doors shut at all times, the two of us got along famously. She didn&amp;rsquo;t get in my face about things, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get in hers. It was a pretty silent house, but one that I got used to living in. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even think it strange anymore that every part of the house that one accessed through a door always had its door shut. It would have struck me as more odd if any doorway was ever left open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the day Aunt Louise fell asleep while watching &lt;em&gt;The Price is Right&lt;/em&gt;. It was a summer day, and pretty hot. Louise was slightly less worried about windows being open than doors, but she still tended to only open one at a time. Today she had just one open, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing much at all to cool down a boxed-in house that had zero room for airflow thanks to Aunt Louise&amp;rsquo;s chief eccentricity. So, naturally, she fell asleep. And I saw my chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her purse was at her feet. I was sitting in the chair directly beside hers, reading an &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; comic book and trying to ignore the repeated calls of &amp;ldquo;Come oooooooon doooooown!&amp;rdquo; from the TV. I looked over at her, and saw that she was in a deep doze. Her hearing wasn&amp;rsquo;t the greatest even when she was awake, though she was far from deaf. But I figured in her snooze, there would be little chance she would hear the tiny noise of me rifling through her purse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found her keys almost immediately and headed for the stairwell. If she woke up when I opened the door, I would just claim I was doing a load of laundry. But she was unlikely to unless I forgot to close the door, which by now I never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed down the stairs, for some reason tip-toeing even though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet at the place I had been shut out from. I felt absurdly guilty, despite the fact that Aunt Louise had never expressly forbidden me from doing what I was now doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door to the basement was closed, of course, but unlocked, as always. I ducked through and closed it, waiting a few minutes, listening for a shifting of Aunt Louise&amp;rsquo;s frame in her chair, indicating she was getting up, or perhaps her voice calling to ask why I was in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quietly, I crept for the laundry room, opened the door, and closed it just as quick, slipping inside. I felt for the chain-pull for the light and pulled it. Low, eerie light flickered through the room. I had never thought of the lighting in here as eerie before, but I did now. There was something about this entire endeavor that felt &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my curiosity overrode my sense of caution. I crept toward the door and slid the board away from it. Aunt Louise had apparently put it back in place after the last time I had done this. The question of why she had done so played in my brain for a moment, but I ignored it and brought out the key ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the right key on the third try, and heard a loud &lt;em&gt;chuck&lt;/em&gt; of the lock sliding away. I froze, heart beating in my chest, waiting to hear a cry from upstairs. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door opened silently as a ghost. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any light to illuminate the staircase beyond. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even see a chain-pull for a light on the stairs. My brain was screaming at the rest of my body to turn around and forget this little adventure, but I paid it no heed and crept down the stairs, feeling along the wall for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out there was a tiny amount of light coming through vents in the ceiling. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t much, but I could see that there was a pull-string light just a few feet from the foot of the stairs. Stupid place to put it; it should be right at the landing. But I walked down what appeared to be a fairly compact hallway and pulled the string. If possible, the light that flickered on was lower than the light from the laundry room. I could barely tell I&amp;rsquo;d turned it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around and saw that, indeed, Aunt Louise did have rows of preserves down here. I was somewhat disappointed at the mundane answer to the mystery. For a moment, it seemed that the secret sub-basement was exactly what it was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except&amp;hellip;I could feel a puff of a warmish breeze that should not be possible down in the hard-packed earthen walls and cooler, subterranean air. The sense of wrongness was still there, and still strong, and I realized that the long row of shelves holding jars ended in a doorway at the end. A doorway that &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t have a door&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crept forward, arms in front of me, stepping carefully. The room beyond the door was dark and smelled musty. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel a source of the slightly warm air that was brushing against my skin. But I was noticing that the closer I got to that room, the warmer the air became.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I was at the mouth of the tunnel (somehow, I had started thinking of this place as a tunnel by this time), the air wasn&amp;rsquo;t just warm, it was humid. Fetid. The smell went from musty to moldy, to something even worse. I was assailed by that sense of wrongness stronger than ever. I had to get out of here. Why was I walking even closer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much light, but I could see the outline of another door on the other side of the room. It was ajar. Seeing a door ajar in Aunt Louise&amp;rsquo;s house was like seeing a shattered window in anyone else&amp;rsquo;s. It was wrong. It was not meant to be. But then&amp;hellip;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t precisely &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; Aunt Louise&amp;rsquo;s house anymore, was I? This tunnel was not built for this house. I knew that in my soul. It was here before. Long before. This was a place that had only become attached to Aunt Louise&amp;rsquo;s house by short-sighted builders, unaware of what they had unearthed. What they should have left buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a moment to realize that the room beyond, the very room I was about to step into, was moving. The light was too dim to really see what was happening, but there was motion beyond it. Unceasing, slow, lazy motion. All along the walls, the floor. I could hear a slight &lt;em&gt;squelching&lt;/em&gt; noise from its every corner. Things were crawling, expanding their pulpous flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And looking at me. Daring me to cross that floor and shut the door on the far side, forever closing out what might be coming through it. I heard sucking sounds. Some formless, gelatinous presence stretched and flexed in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that moment, a sense of understanding came to me. I was not the first person to stand at this door. This door that could not be closed. Not the first person to see that other door, the one that was not meant to be, standing open on the other side, and knowing that it always would, until someone worked up the courage to cross the threshold and close it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aunt Louise had not had the courage, so she had fled, and kept every door in her house closed at all times, hoping against hope that keeping her doors closed at all times would alert her when whatever was beyond that damned door finally came for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the courage, either. I turned and fled, and never looked back. When I was sixteen, I moved out of Aunt Louise&amp;rsquo;s and into a halfway house. Once I was eighteen, I got a job upstate and moved there. I never went back to Aunt Louise&amp;rsquo;s and never called her, tried hard to not even think about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I haven&amp;rsquo;t been successful. I still think back to the day I stood at that doorway, about the squelching, wriggling things that waited in the dark. And I wonder if Aunt Louise ever found the strength to cross the room and shut that damned door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog author: &lt;strong&gt;Reed Murdock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-16th-2014&#34;&gt;October 16th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a blog about my new life. Most of you reading this are probably my friends and acquaintances, but for the rest of you, I&amp;rsquo;ll expose a little bit about myself. My name&amp;rsquo;s Reed. I just moved out of my stupid parents&amp;rsquo; basement (thank God) and now I&amp;rsquo;m pursuing my own life where no one can push me around anymore. Technically I&amp;rsquo;m the one who ditched the place, but they all but kicked me out beforehand. Nobody gives a damn about a &amp;ldquo;crackhead&amp;rdquo; like me, not even my parents. Not that I care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;rsquo;m doing my own thing now. I had to give up a few luxuries, my Mom&amp;rsquo;s hellacious cooking not worthy of being called a luxury. I&amp;rsquo;d much rather live off discount ramen noodles anyways. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll even have corn on the side when I&amp;rsquo;m feeling extra fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of fancy, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit my apartment is anything but. It&amp;rsquo;s the cheapest one I could find, in fact. I find the saying &amp;ldquo;you get what you pay for&amp;rdquo; to be especially true when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to sleep to the lulling sound of what I can only guess is some old lady getting mugged in the dark alleyway next door. My ghetto sanctuary consists of one living room, a kitchenette, a bathroom, and a closet. The walls are practically made of cardboard and the carpet is stained with God knows what, but it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with me is my poor excuse for a cat named Twig. She&amp;rsquo;s one of those weird hairless breeds, and in turn, a real conversation piece. I&amp;rsquo;m often asked why the cat&amp;rsquo;s turned inside out, or if she was the victim of some perverse taxidermy project gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shoddy as my life seems, living on the cheap has its benefits. My cost of living is next to nothing, so I can make enough money to survive by doing odd jobs on the internet without ever leaving the house. I spend half of the month writing bogus reviews for products I&amp;rsquo;ve never used and filling out surveys on political issues I know nothing about, then spend the other half surfing the web and watching pirated reruns of The X-Files. I don&amp;rsquo;t even have to pay for internet service thanks to my neighbors&amp;rsquo; complete failure to secure their Wi-Fi hotspot. I bet their data overages are through the roof now. Oh well, not my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be updating this blog every day or two if I&amp;rsquo;m up to anything interesting. Thanks for reading this boring crap; hopefully my life will get a little more exciting in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-18th-2014&#34;&gt;October 18th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do something unusual. It&amp;rsquo;s 3AM and I intend to stay up all night, caffeinated beverages at my side. Why am I doing this, you ask? Because I&amp;rsquo;m permanently switching to a nocturnal sleep schedule. In other words, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sleeping during the day instead of the night. I have a number of good reasons for doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s less people out at night, so leaving the building won&amp;rsquo;t be such a dreaded thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunlight gives you cancer, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screw social norms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internet speed seems to increase substantially after midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a free country, I don&amp;rsquo;t even need reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I ran into this cool forum called Nocturnal Underground. Naturally, it&amp;rsquo;s full of sun-loathing recluses and cynical misanthropes like me. How perfect. I registered straight away and found the forum-dwellers to be very welcoming. It&amp;rsquo;s not the most famous of internet destinations&amp;mdash;more of a tight-knit hole in the wall for a very obscure subculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all seem to share a general appreciation for societal disconnect, which is cool, because I really thought I was the only wackjob who can&amp;rsquo;t stand dealing with normal people. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s these &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; people who are telling me I don&amp;rsquo;t have the right to smoke whatever substances I damn well please, as if it&amp;rsquo;s their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let you all know how this whole nocturnal thing works for me. Peace out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-21st-2014&#34;&gt;October 21st, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m adjusting very well to my new lifestyle. I can already tell this is the way I should&amp;rsquo;ve been living all along. The internet is a far more interesting place during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything has been fairly normal lately, except for one thing. Yesternight, I received a mysterious private message on Nocturnal Underground. Here it is, copied and pasted for your reading pleasure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To: Reedman07&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;From: Revelation666&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Necrosleep.net&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Reedman07. You&amp;rsquo;ve been invited to an invitation-only website that will change your life forever. Discover what society doesn&amp;rsquo;t want you to know at Necrosleep.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your exclusive invitation code to enter: &lt;code&gt;DCLXVI&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out what you&amp;rsquo;ve been missing your entire life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necrosleep.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a total scam, but it piqued my interest. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist going to the site just to see what the hell it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went there and arrived at a completely empty black page. I noticed the text cursor blinking in the center, indicating that I could type. I presumed that this was where I was supposed to put in the invitation code, and I presumed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the home page loaded, I immediately noticed that all of the text was in Russian besides the title header, which simply said &amp;ldquo;Necrosleep.net&amp;rdquo; in English. My web browser automatically detected that the site was Russian and offered to translate it for me, so of course, I clicked yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this site was clearly on the shady side. Whoever made it was certainly not well versed in web design, as it had more in common with a notepad document than a good webpage. The background was black, the white text was written in the oh-so-generic Courier font, and under the title header was a row of red hyperlinks labeled as follows: Main, Purchase, Secret, and Credit. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from the main page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Necrosleep.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is invitation-only. Selected visitors have exclusive access to our special product that will change your life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necrosleep is a product that safely negates the biological necessity of sleep, thanks to our miraculous secret formula. With one pill a day, you will never feel the need to sleep again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it for yourself by clicking the purchase link. If Necrosleep doesn&amp;rsquo;t change your life, we will offer you a complete refund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your astonishment is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a bold claim these people are making. There&amp;rsquo;s no way this stuff actually works, otherwise everyone would be taking it. Obviously I was skeptical, and still am, but I snooped around the site a bit more, just out of curiosity. I clicked the &amp;ldquo;Secret&amp;rdquo; hyperlink, which took me to another page. Here&amp;rsquo;s the text from said page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necrosleep is comprised of special and rare ingredients, which we cannot disclose in order to ensure that our formula stays in private hands. In order to keep our product available, it can only be distributed through alternative means on an exclusive basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The active ingredient in Necrosleep has been sought after for years by doctors and scientists intending to displace sleep with wakefulness. Only we have managed to do what others could not, as permitted by the will of our master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can assure you with full confidence that our product will change your life, and you will never feel need to sleep again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to indulge in our secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative means? More like black market. Whatever&amp;rsquo;s going on here doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be&amp;hellip; legal, exactly. Not that I care about the law, I just get untrustworthy vibes from this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I continued on and clicked the &amp;ldquo;Credit&amp;rdquo; hyperlink. My heart skipped a little when I was confronted with honestly the most uncanny photo of a living person I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. It was an old black and white photo of a tall man in a doctor&amp;rsquo;s coat. If he wasn&amp;rsquo;t standing upright, I&amp;rsquo;d say the guy was dead, but my guess is that he was just cadaverously unhealthy, and probably blind from the looks of his pale, lifeless eyes. Not a trace of emotion could be found in his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a small bit of text below the photo, which read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit for the pioneering of Necrosleep goes to the brilliant Dr. Hail A. Stan, proxy of our master and founder of the Ukrainian Institute of Occult Medicine. His work lives on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy of our master? Occult medicine? Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve watched too many horror movies, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t your typical snake oil sales pitch. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;re part of some deranged religious group or something? I admit I was slightly creeped out, but more fascinated. I clicked the &amp;ldquo;Purchase&amp;rdquo; hyperlink, out of mere curiosity once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out each pill costs some absurd amount of Russian currency, which I found was equal to about 130 US dollars per pill. Ridiculous! Not that I would buy them, even if I could. I immediately left the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it&amp;rsquo;s probably a lousy foreign credit card scam or some weird cult initiative. Either way, it made my day more interesting than it normally would&amp;rsquo;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-22nd-2014&#34;&gt;October 22nd, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted a thread on Nocturnal Underground about the mystery user who sent me the strange PM. I found myself wanting to know more about this whole Necrosleep.net thing, so as a part of my investigation, I sought to find out who the user was. Here&amp;rsquo;s a transcript of the forum thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‐‐‐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hey guys, I hope I&amp;rsquo;m not disrupting the order of things by posting this in the Trolling and Harassment section, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know where else to put it. I figured this incident of mine might qualify as a spam case if other people are getting the same advertisement message I am. Basically the other day I got a PM from a user I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before called Revelation666, and the message was an advertisement for some supplement. Has anyone seen this user on the forums before? I sure haven&amp;rsquo;t. If you have any information that&amp;rsquo;d be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t recognize the username. He must be fairly new or just inactive. What were the exact contents of the message? We could probably get an admin to ban him for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here&amp;rsquo;s a screencap of the message.&lt;br&gt;
[Message.jpg]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Strange. Did you actually go to the website? I hope not, it&amp;rsquo;s probably infested with viruses. Lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B3457w4rf4r3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just tried going there. It&amp;rsquo;s just a black screen. The invite code didn&amp;rsquo;t work either, it just gave me a popup box that said invalid IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of course I went there. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thuglyfe4lyfe:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for me either. Invalid IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If it only works for Reedman07, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s bound to his IP somehow. Can you get some screenshots of the site? You&amp;rsquo;ve sparked my interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here you are. The page was initially in Russian so I had my browser translate it.&lt;br&gt;
[Main.jpg] [Purchase.jpg] [Secret.jpg] [Credit.jpg]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B3457w4rf4r3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Looks shady as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wow. Don&amp;rsquo;t even mess with it, you&amp;rsquo;re asking for trouble just by clicking the link. You&amp;rsquo;re probably being keylogged as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B3457w4rf4r3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not to mention the product they&amp;rsquo;re selling is probably laced with cyanide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If he&amp;rsquo;s stupid enough to buy it, well, the gene pool is better off without him anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B3457w4rf4r3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Never trust a Russian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thuglyfe4lyfe:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m Russian and I find that offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B3457w4rf4r3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You just said you were Asian last week, make up your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I leave this thread for 5 minutes and chaos ensues. Everybody calm the [expletive] down. Of course I&amp;rsquo;m not going to mess with it, these supposed miracle pills are $130 each anyways. Who do you think I am, Johnny Cash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thuglyfe4lyfe:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just because his name was Johnny Cash doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean he was rich or had lots of cash or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B3457w4rf4r3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Of course he was rich, you dumb [expletive], he&amp;rsquo;s Johnny [expletive] Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whose bright idea was it to equip this forum with a profanity filter anyways? It&amp;rsquo;s [expletive] stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before this thread deteriorates any further, let me just say I&amp;rsquo;ve put tape over my webcam just in case something slipped past my antivirus, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably just a credit card scam or something. I&amp;rsquo;ll do some research on it tomorrow, the sun&amp;rsquo;s been up for three hours and I&amp;rsquo;m running low on energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll contact one of the admins about this. Spam isn&amp;rsquo;t tolerated here. I ought to see if they&amp;rsquo;re willing to uninstall the profanity filter plugin as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‐‐‐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a message later on from HGWishingWells (one of the admins) saying that the user Revelation666 doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the database, and that the only way I could&amp;rsquo;ve received the message is if the mail client was bypassed somehow. In other words, somebody hacked the system just to send me a spam message. What the hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-23rd-2014&#34;&gt;October 23rd 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to Googling Necrosleep. The results were mostly irrelevant YouTube channels and defunct &amp;rsquo;90s screamo bands from the looks of it, but I noticed among the garbage results a link to a post on FastMD.com. The preview said, &amp;ldquo;Does anyone know if this Necrosleep stuff actually works?&amp;rdquo; So I clicked on it, only to be directed to a page stating &amp;ldquo;The post you&amp;rsquo;re looking for has been deleted and no longer exists.&amp;rdquo; I should have known. Nothing can ever be easy and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to the results, and had to scan over several pages of them before finally running into an old gaming forum thread where the website Necrosleep.net was mentioned. This time, the post hadn&amp;rsquo;t been deleted. In the middle of a conversation about maximizing crop production in some medieval strategy game, one of the users claimed to have taken Necrosleep in order to tend to his virtual farm 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the other forum patrons were highly skeptical. The guy posted a link to Necrosleep.net in an attempt to back up his claim, ultimately failing to convince them because&amp;mdash;you guessed it&amp;mdash;the site was bound to his IP address. He also had the same invitation code as me (DCLXVI) leading me to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s just a formality intended to make you feel special. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain why and how my IP&amp;mdash;and apparently someone else&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;got singled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bragger then claimed that there was irrefutable proof of his ceaseless wakefulness in his in-game score. In relation to the length of time his account had existed, his score was excessively high. So high, in fact, that it would be impossible for him to attain so high a score in so short a time frame, unless he was playing the game for at least 21 hours a day, which leaves practically no time for sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, they attributed his accomplishment to an automatic bot program that operated the game for him during the night. Since cheating in this way is against the game rules, his account was promptly banned, according to the moderator at the end of the thread. Sure enough, in little red letters below his forum avatar were the words &amp;ldquo;Banned for bot abuse, 8/12/2006.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any more relevant results for Necrosleep or Necrosleep.net other than what I&amp;rsquo;ve just told you about. Looks like these online dope dealers are pretty stealthy. I&amp;rsquo;m just dying to know what their real motives might be, &amp;lsquo;cause I could think of a million better ways to steal someone&amp;rsquo;s credit card number or peddle quack remedies. It could be a prank, but evidently this has been going on since 2006 at least. Perhaps some jokes just never die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-25th-2014&#34;&gt;October 25th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got another PM from Revelation666. Am I the only one who gets creeped out by that name? Knowing what I know now, it makes me uneasy to think about the great lengths this user went to contact me specifically. For some reason, they stealthily bypassed the system just to send me these messages and make me this &amp;ldquo;offer.&amp;rdquo; Here is the message I received:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To: Reedman07&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;From: Revelation666&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Necrosleep.net/backdoor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Reedman07. You&amp;rsquo;ve been selected to receive a free 30 day trial of Necrosleep. Claim your exclusive reward at Necrosleep.net/backdoor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out what you&amp;rsquo;ve been missing your entire life, risk free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necrosleep.net/backdoor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, my curiosity got the best of me. Bracing myself for whatever scam was coming my way, I clicked the link. I was taken to a page asking for my address, nothing more. I thought about it carefully, knowing full well that these people likely have malicious intentions. But if I entered my post office box, what&amp;rsquo;s the worst that could happen? Them sending me some junk mail or faulty pills? The point is that I&amp;rsquo;ll finally know what they want from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered the address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-28th-2014&#34;&gt;October 28th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go back to the thread I posted on Nocturnal Underground and let people know what&amp;rsquo;s up. Sure enough, their reactions were amusing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‐‐‐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well guys, it happened again. Look at the attachment.&lt;br&gt;
[Message2.jpg]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t tell me you clicked on this one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I did. Then it asked me for my address. But don&amp;rsquo;t worry. I only entered my PO box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Are you out of your [expletive] mind?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I take it you couldn&amp;rsquo;t persuade the admins to disable the profanity filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No [expletive] Sherlock. Apparently they get a huge kick out of watching us quarrel over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if HGWishingWells sent me these weird messages just to stir up some controversy around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HGWishingWells:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Neither would I&amp;hellip; ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mystery has been solved. Everybody go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HGWishingWells:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In all seriousness, I had nothing to do with this. I swear on my great grandmother&amp;rsquo;s life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Swearing on the life of a dead person isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the most convincing way to plead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I think the joke&amp;rsquo;s gone far enough. HG, did you do it or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HGWishingWells:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I really didn&amp;rsquo;t do it. The admins and I were genuinely perplexed when we saw where the message came from. Or should I say, where the message DIDN&amp;rsquo;T come from. It was certainly not from any registered user on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B3457w4rf4r3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If they actually send you the pills, are you going to take them? You couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay me a million bucks to try that [expletive].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic_Trashbin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I can personally guarantee you that stuff is too good to be true. Nothing can make you stay awake forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HGWishingWells:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I agree with Cosmic. Don&amp;rsquo;t take this any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedman07:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even if they do send me the pills and it&amp;rsquo;s not just junk mail, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to take it unless I find some more information on it. Do you really think I&amp;rsquo;m that stupid? Chill out, guys. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t update this thread anymore, so follow my blog if you want to know what&amp;rsquo;s up with me. The link&amp;rsquo;s on my profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‐‐‐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we pretty much ruled out the possibility that it&amp;rsquo;s a prank by the admins. I don&amp;rsquo;t think HGWishingWells would carry on a joke this long, nor would he lie so blatantly. And even if one of the other admins were to prank me, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine they would do it with some Russian supplement pitch. It&amp;rsquo;s just all too strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-30th-2014&#34;&gt;October 30th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I had a buddy of mine deliver the mail to my doorstep in exchange for some coding work on his Flash site. I&amp;rsquo;ll do just about anything to avoid leaving the building. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the point; the point is that I received an envelope with no return address. Yet I immediately knew who it was from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was old. Very old, like it&amp;rsquo;d been sitting in a dusty attic for decades. I opened the stained envelope only to find a smaller manila envelope inside, also rather old-looking. Inscribed on the small envelope was the word &amp;ldquo;Necrosleep&amp;rdquo; and a word of advice on storing the packet in a cool, dark place for maximum potency. The words appeared to have been stamped onto the envelope rather than printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened the small envelope, and sure enough, there were 30 black pills inside, more crude than what you might get from your local pharmacy. Now before you all start freaking out, I&amp;rsquo;m NOT going to take these. At least not until I can dig up some more reliable information on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know that these Russian dope dealers weren&amp;rsquo;t just trying to send me junk mail. The question is, why would they send me the pills if they don&amp;rsquo;t actually work? Surely they must want my money, which they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get after a failed 30 day trial. What if they&amp;rsquo;re trying to kill me? I never did have a good feeling about any of this. But the curiosity is killing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-31st-2014&#34;&gt;October 31st, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just occurred to me that I completely overlooked something. I never researched Dr. Hail A. Stan, the guy who apparently had something to do with Necrosleep. So I did a quick Google search and found&amp;mdash;much to my surprise&amp;mdash;that he had his own article on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article states that Dr. Stan was a Ukrainian scientist and physician. He claimed to have been directly involved in the experiments portrayed in a 1940 motion picture, which documented Soviet research into the resuscitation of clinically dead organisms. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motion picture &amp;ldquo;Experiments in the Revival of Organisms&amp;rdquo; depicts various disturbing medical experiments conducted on canines, one of which involves keeping a dog&amp;rsquo;s decapitated head alive with a primitive autojector machine that supplied it with oxygenated blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operations in the film were credited to Dr. Sergei Brukhonenko. However, Dr. Hail A. Stan incessantly claimed to be the one who really conducted the experiments and invented the autojector, and that they only credited Brukhonenko because Stan was sentenced to life in prison for illegally conducting gruesome experiments on humans. He believed that because he had consent from his test subjects (albeit through bribery) he had not committed an immoral crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lenin Prize was awarded to Brukhonenko for the autojector, while Stan remained in permanent imprisonment. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until they discovered the lost footage of his morbid human experiments that they had him executed by lethal injection. His last words, spoken in an unidentified language, died with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hail A. Stan was rumored to have pioneered a variety of cures for major conditions such as narcolepsy and epilepsy. However, the results were not published in a scientific manner, and therefore the majority of his alleged accomplishments were unverifiable, as well as seemingly occult in nature. The number of people he apparently cured of various incurable afflictions between 1930 and 1940 was in the thousands. Attempts to replicate his documented remedies ultimately failed, leading most to believe he was practicing pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed by some that Dr. Hail A. Stan has a following to this day, and that his miracle cures are still being practiced and peddled from Russia and Ukraine. Some claim to have received mysterious emails and offers pertaining to Dr. Hail A. Stan&amp;rsquo;s work; all investigations revealed no evidence to support these claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, some of this stuff unnerves me. Morbid human experiments aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly pleasant things to think about. But it seems to me this guy was just doing what was necessary to advance his research. Maybe he really was on to something? Maybe his cures couldn&amp;rsquo;t be replicated because they were so advanced? I don&amp;rsquo;t really know. All I know is that I received one of these mysterious offers that supposedly don&amp;rsquo;t exist beyond hearsay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something to this. Maybe I really was selected to receive a gift too great for the masses. Maybe they were dead serious when they said this would change my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-1st-2014&#34;&gt;November 1st, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m holding the pill in my hand, ready to take it at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking hard about this. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not the safest thing to do, but I&amp;rsquo;m a risk-taker. If this turns out badly, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to live for anyways. Life is nothing without danger, and I want to know the motives of these people more than anything. I need to know what they want from me. I need to know what I&amp;rsquo;m missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-3rd-2014&#34;&gt;November 3rd, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it. It&amp;rsquo;s actually working. I haven&amp;rsquo;t slept in 3 days and I don&amp;rsquo;t even feel remotely tired. Holy hell! I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt so focused and stimulated in my life. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s in this stuff, but it WORKS. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it&amp;rsquo;s going to work exactly, so I&amp;rsquo;m not getting my hopes up. But the claim is that I&amp;rsquo;ll never need to sleep again. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-4th-2014&#34;&gt;November 4th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still works like a charm after 4 days. But lately, the light has been really bothering me, so I duct taped a piece of cardboard over the window. I never liked that window anyways. At night, I get this feeling that I&amp;rsquo;m being watched from outside, and it&amp;rsquo;s been making me anxious more than usual. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to think you&amp;rsquo;re seeing something uncanny out the window, until you realize it&amp;rsquo;s just your own reflection distorted by the cheap glass pane. Anyways, that issue has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found something interesting when I was taking my nightly pill. Until recently, I failed to notice a symbol stamped on the inside of the small manila envelope. Yes, the inside. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the symbol before, but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember where exactly. It&amp;rsquo;s a downward-pointing pentagram with what I think is a goat&amp;rsquo;s head inscribed within it. Maybe they just re-used an old envelope and turned it inside out or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-5th-2014&#34;&gt;November 5th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to one of my followers for pointing out something I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize; the emblem inside the envelope was actually Satanic symbol&amp;hellip; Yeah, needless to say I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not taking this crap anymore. This sort of thing really creeps me out. I&amp;rsquo;m done. I wish I would have read that message before I took it tonight. I&amp;rsquo;ll just quit tomorrow. I mean, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t harmed me thus far, and I feel great, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just being paranoid. It&amp;rsquo;s just a symbol, probably a printing mistake or something. But screw that. I&amp;rsquo;m not messing around with demonic affairs. No way in Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking one of these pills at exactly 10:00 PM each night. I planned on stopping the pills tonight, but around 10:30, I started getting this horrible headache, and it got progressively worse. I was thinking maybe it was just me adjusting to suddenly going off Necrosleep, so I waited another hour, and I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t take it anymore. I took another pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I could quit if I wanted to, but I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to. I mean, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to sleep anymore. I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling energized. I should just man up and stop being irrational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-9th-2014&#34;&gt;November 9th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a killing with all this free time and newfound focus. I made five grand in a single day of trading virtual property; that&amp;rsquo;s not including my online poker proceeds over the last week, which are through the goddamn roof. Suddenly I have this intuitive grasp of numbers that I never had before. I&amp;rsquo;ve been living my life in a daze until now&amp;hellip; they were right. This really is changing my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-11th-2014&#34;&gt;November 11th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a rather peculiar story for you guys. I was sitting on the couch, minding my own business, when I noticed a couple of gleaming eyes staring at me from the dark corner. I thought nothing of it, knowing it must&amp;rsquo;ve been Twig skulking about. Cats have reflective eyes, who else would it be? I looked away, and at that very same moment, I felt it. Twig&amp;rsquo;s wrinkly little self curling up next to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked back toward the corner, those beady eyes still fixed upon me with Twig clearly at my side. I blinked, and the eyes were gone. Man, my brain&amp;rsquo;s really trying to screw with me. It had to have been mental. Yet I remember it with such lucidity. Come to think of it, I should&amp;rsquo;ve known it wasn&amp;rsquo;t Twig from the start. Cat&amp;rsquo;s eyes don&amp;rsquo;t glow red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, let&amp;rsquo;s hope it was just a freak brain malfunction. After all, what else could it possibly be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-12th-2014&#34;&gt;November 12th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to run out of food eventually. Obviously I COULD go to the store and restock myself, but&amp;hellip; the thought scares me. The thought of leaving the safety of my apartment&amp;mdash;the thought of social interaction&amp;mdash;I now dread it more than I ever have. I never have preferred going out to staying in, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never dreaded it this much. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t always so terribly afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of my instant messenger friends have been online lately, and they stopped upvoting my blog posts. Who&amp;rsquo;s going to get my groceries? What if I have to go out there? I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be panicking like this, honestly. I&amp;rsquo;m being stupid. Stop panicking, you idiot. Stop panicking, you idiot. Stop panicking you idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-13th-2014&#34;&gt;November 13th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Jake came online. It was a temporary relief that lasted about as long as it took him to say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not dropping off the food until you agree to get out of the house.&amp;rdquo; That was his offer, entailing that I leave the house and go clubbing with the guys in exchange for help. I declined out of pure fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was worried for my health, apparently. I can&amp;rsquo;t blame him for thinking I&amp;rsquo;m becoming a feral hermit doomed to die alone in this pathetic slum, but he just doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand. Nobody understands me. At least I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I got enough food to last till Thanksgiving, if I stretch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-15th-2014&#34;&gt;November 15th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to tell you all about another strange experience I had yesterday. I&amp;rsquo;ve been leaving my TV on lately so that the silence doesn&amp;rsquo;t irritate me. That children&amp;rsquo;s show Bucko&amp;rsquo;s Garden was on. You know, the one we all watched as kids, until we were mature enough to realize how mindless and nonsensical it was. Yeah, that show. It was playing in the background on my boxy old TV in the corner. Eventually it distracted me, and I found myself zoning out into it for lack of better things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must&amp;rsquo;ve been a Thanksgiving episode, considering Bucko (a guy dressed like a deer with a human face) was in the kitchen preparing sweet potatoes and cranberries. This is about as intelligible as the show gets. Things got a bit weird when he decided to let the anthropomorphic cranberries go into his garden at the last minute, as if they were captive insects. The sweet potatoes weren&amp;rsquo;t so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bucko sent his bird friends to retrieve a pumpkin pie from the pie tree, and his squirrel friends to collect gravy from the gravy cow, who coincidentally regurgitates mashed potatoes to boot. I told you this show was weird, but that&amp;rsquo;s not even the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize something was off until Bucko pulled out a knife — a full fledged razor-sharp knife that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect to see in such a benign show. With his other hand, he opened the oven, and pulled it out. Not a ham, not a turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A roasted human fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even believe what I was seeing. How on Earth could this be allowed on television? Were my eyes deceiving me? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I turned it off as soon as he started cutting into it. The gore was too much, even for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still having a hard time believing what my own eyes clearly saw. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been dreaming; I haven&amp;rsquo;t had so much as a nap in 15 days. I just&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t even know. Maybe something&amp;rsquo;s wrong with me. I&amp;rsquo;ve been forgetting my PC login password, even after I changed it to something else and wrote it down I forgot where I wrote it down where I wrote it forgot it down. I can&amp;rsquo;t even think properly right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-18th-2014&#34;&gt;November 18th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie. I&amp;rsquo;m scared out of my mind right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked into the bathroom, planning to take my first shower in weeks. I never imagined I&amp;rsquo;d open the door and see anything more than my own reflection in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I saw it. Standing behind me. Staring. Completely motionless. I froze and panicked more than I ever have in my entire life, I swear. You don&amp;rsquo;t know true fear. You don&amp;rsquo;t even have a clue. I can still see it, engraved in my mind. The face. It was&amp;hellip; demonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was gone as soon as it came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d say I was just imagining things, but it felt all too real. I&amp;rsquo;m not going into that bathroom ever again. I&amp;rsquo;ll just go in the kitchen sink or something. I can&amp;rsquo;t handle this. I wonder if these pills are screwing with my head. I need to stop. I need to stop now. I don&amp;rsquo;t even feel safe in my own apartment anymore. I feel like the shadows are watching me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-20th-2014&#34;&gt;November 20th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to stop the pills again, but I had a change of heart at the last minute. Something told me not to, like a voice in my head. I just feel like it would be wrong, and somehow my life would fall apart if I stopped. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is normal, the way I&amp;rsquo;m living, but I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine it any other way. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine stepping out into the light, or even the moonlight for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my instant messenger contacts have been offline since Jake talked to me last, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if my food will last another week. Twig&amp;rsquo;s getting pretty skinny since I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating her cat food to stretch my supplies a bit, but she&amp;rsquo;ll be okay as long as someone comes online by Thanksgiving. Speaking of which, nobody invited me over for Thanksgiving dinner, not even my family. But that&amp;rsquo;s okay, I hate my parents anyways. Screw them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-24th-2014&#34;&gt;November 24th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knock knock. I yelled through the drafty door, asking who it was. It was my &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; Jake and Douglas. Apparently they wanted to help me after seeing my blog posts of distress. But sure enough, it was only under the condition that I open the door and come out. Very suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I really know I can trust them? I know I&amp;rsquo;ve trusted them for years, but what if they were just earning my trust so they could pull something more sinister later on? What if they give me drugged food? What if they stab me when I open the door? It just occurred to me that I have no real proof that I can trust them; I can&amp;rsquo;t even trust myself anymore. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know who I am. Maybe my whole life I&amp;rsquo;ve been a sadistic freak and didn&amp;rsquo;t even know it. Maybe my true self is just now coming out. Maybe everyone is evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-25th-2014&#34;&gt;November 25th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices won&amp;rsquo;t stop. I used to think they were malevolent, but now I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure. Sometimes it feels like they&amp;rsquo;re trying to liberate me. They want me to listen to them desperately. They show me things, horrible things, and yet these things don&amp;rsquo;t seem horrible to me anymore. I&amp;rsquo;m numb. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I can do to make me feel again. Part of me says it&amp;rsquo;s terribly wrong. But the voices tell me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices are my friends now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demons are my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;november-26th-2014&#34;&gt;November 26th, 2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twig is in heaven now. I had to do it. I had to know what it tasted like. It was satisfying, but I need more. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d never leave this room again, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a choice anymore. I need more of it. The face is getting angry. The voices are getting angry. My head hurts so bad. I need more. It hurts so much. I need more. They&amp;rsquo;re hurting me. I need to feed them more. They need more. I need more. I have to make it stop. I need more I NEED MORE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAKE IT STOP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;police-report-pt-1--thanksgiving--11272014&#34;&gt;Police Report Pt. 1 – Thanksgiving – 11/27/2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victim: &lt;strong&gt;Paul Murdock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressor: &lt;strong&gt;Reed Murdock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police arrived on the scene after a frantic 911 call from Margaret Murdock (confirmed to be the aggressor&amp;rsquo;s mother). The victim, Paul Murdock (the aggressor&amp;rsquo;s father) was found in the process of being mauled and cannibalized by the aggressor, Reed Murdock, whose face and mouth was covered in blood and brain matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reed was shot dead after refusing to stop eating his own father, whose skull was torn open entirely. Drug use is suspected to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;police-report-pt-2--11292014&#34;&gt;Police Report Pt. 2 – 11/29/2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reed Murdock&amp;rsquo;s residence was inspected thoroughly by investigators. A hairless, headless, and disemboweled cat carcass was found on the kitchen counter. The cat&amp;rsquo;s blood and bodily fluids were spilled throughout the house, while the head was found crushed, the brain having been completely removed and nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apartment was clearly inhabited by an utterly insane individual, given the foul and uncleanly nature of the place. An old TV rested in the corner, turned on, displaying only static and white noise. It had no antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suspicious packet of unidentified pills was recovered. The resident&amp;rsquo;s computer and other personal effects were confiscated and await further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;autopsy-report--1242014&#34;&gt;Autopsy Report – 12/4/2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject: &lt;strong&gt;Reed Murdock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of Reed Murdock&amp;rsquo;s digestive tract were a disturbing mixture of human tissue, mostly brain matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Examination of his own brain, however, was even more disturbing and perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clearly and visibly deteriorating; the tissue was black and red rather than the usual pinkish gray, and riddled with holes throughout. Closer examination revealed thousands small black parasites to be consuming the brain. This was undoubtedly the cause of the man&amp;rsquo;s insidious psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing on the parasites was inconclusive, as they didn&amp;rsquo;t match any known species. Further testing is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unknown pills recovered from Murdock&amp;rsquo;s apartment have been tested and confirmed to contain a vile plethora of uncommon substances, including obscure, highly addictive euphoric drugs, human hormones, and parasitic eggs, presumably meant to remain dormant in a cool place until introduced into the body, allowing them to hatch and eventually invade the brain. It is unclear how Murdock acquired the pills and where they came from, although whoever concocted them surely had malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;police-report-pt-3--1262014&#34;&gt;Police Report Pt. 3 – 12/6/2014&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two friends of Reed Murdock&amp;mdash;Jake Fairfax and Douglas Lopez&amp;mdash;were questioned at the police station. Immediately, they referred to his online blog, where he allegedly recorded his path to eventual insanity. It was found that the blog had mysteriously disappeared off the face of the internet for reasons unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were aware of the unknown pills Reed was taking, claiming they originated from the website Necrosleep.net. Investigators later confirmed the website does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;august-16th-2014&#34;&gt;August 16th, 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into this, I need to make something clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t happening right now. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to beg for advice or help, because I&amp;rsquo;m beyond any of your help. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to give up everything in my life that ever mattered. This happened more than 9 years ago, and I&amp;rsquo;m finally taking the risk to share it. World events are seriously scaring me, and I have more&amp;hellip;personal reasons that I can get into later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To post this, I&amp;rsquo;ve driven around town for forty minutes before I found an unsecured internet connection. I&amp;rsquo;m not risking posting this from my own. I made a throwaway account, which has no ties to anything related to my life. I&amp;rsquo;m well and truly fucked, and it&amp;rsquo;s all because of an email that I should never have received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2005 I thought I had everything I ever needed from life. I had just finished grad school and begun teaching English at a local community college, had married the love of my life that January in an awesome and geeky ceremony, we had moved into a fix-it-up bungalow on three acres of land, and we had just rescued an Elkhound puppy from a local shelter. Life was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I wish I had enjoyed those days more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife (I&amp;rsquo;ll call her Fay, not her real name) and I had just finished working outside one night in July, and we were relaxing with a beer on the porch. Fireflies were doing their little &amp;ldquo;I glow, you glow, we all fuck like rabbits” dance, and our puppy was gnawing on a pair of my socks I had tied into a knot for him. I asked Fay if she would mind if I checked my email before we went to bed; I was expecting a notification about the classes I was going to teach in the fall, and was looking forward to actually using my degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fay went up to bed, and I logged into my work email account. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t an email from my department chair, but there was a new email entitled &amp;ldquo;Progress of EBOV-7x.” I figured it was spam, but I impulsively clicked on it anyway. The email&amp;rsquo;s intended address was literally two letters off from mine, and it came with an attachment named &amp;ldquo;E-7x results and suggestions.” It was addressed to a man named Mark, and it read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Mark,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attached are the prelim results from the last batch of tests on EBOV-7. The x-generation seems to be holding up much better to the modifications. Remember this is EYES ONLY, so don&amp;rsquo;t print this out or anything. You&amp;rsquo;re new here, and we all think your help is really what&amp;rsquo;s gotten us off the ground on this. If you have anything to add, let me know ASAP.&lt;/em&gt; Provided this gen holds up, we&amp;rsquo;ll have a much better quarterly report for the bigwigs than we did last time. Don&amp;rsquo;t wear the tie with the mustard stain on it, OK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Reagan&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no clue who either of these people were, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize the domain name of the email address. The only part I could make out was &amp;ldquo;Detrick.” Just as I finished reading it, Fay called and asked if I was ready to head to bed. I told her I would only be a minute, the cursor hovering over the download link for the PDF file. Every reasonable part of me said to just delete the email, to pretend I never saw it&amp;hellip;but, as you can probably tell, I was youthful and impulsive. I clicked the download link, and after a few seconds, the downloaded file popped up in my downloads. I opened it, fully expecting it to be password locked&amp;mdash;I mean, from the tone of the email, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Fuck, I wish it had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it opened, I was bombarded with sentences so thick with scientific lingo that I had difficulty even parsing them out. I was a Liberal Arts major, for fuck&amp;rsquo;s sake. There was one diagram I recognized, though, from having a friend in undergrad who majored in epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looked like the picture below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/email/DLcrT80.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Ebola&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, that&amp;rsquo;s Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skimmed down, until I finally found a paragraph that summarized what I had been struggling to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With the iteration of EBOV-7x and the hiring of new personnel, we believe we have finally addressed the main desires of the client. EBOV-7x contains the following alterations from the base EBOV-0:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A) Increased incubation time of 12 to 40 days as opposed to EBOV-0 incubation of 2 to 12 days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B) Suppressed the lack-of-appetite common in EBOV-0, thus removing one of the major diagnosable tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C) Increased durability of the virus, allowing it to remain hot for up to 8 hours outside the human body (See Test 100BA for applicable data).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;D) Decreased rate of fever increase by 20%, allowing for upwards of 35% more time before patient becomes immobilized.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pushed my chair away from the computer and simply stared for a minute. I rubbed my eyes, and reread the paragraph over and over again. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe what I was reading&amp;mdash;what would be the point to this? Who would want these changes to an already deadly virus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a deep breath, I forced myself to relax. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t an expert on anything related to Ebola, but one of my strengths had always been an ability to think outside the box and move past my own internal assumptions. I asked myself, what purpose would these changes have? What would be the goal behind it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I asked myself that, the answer came to me quickly. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t about making a vaccine, or wanting to remove the danger from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone was altering Ebola to make it less noticeable, to make it less easily diagnosable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone was making a version of Ebola that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t burn itself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A version of Ebola that COULD be a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Shit. Holy. Fucking. Shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On pure autopilot, I copied the file onto a USB stick and put it in my messenger bag I used for work. I marked the email as unread and deleted it, then went upstairs to bed. As Fay snored beside me and the puppy curled himself into the crook of my neck, sleep did not find me. I had no clue what to do. Should I go to the police? The news? Should I just forget it ever happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I fell asleep, and got up the next morning. I debated telling Fay about the email&amp;mdash;I had never kept anything from her for the four years we had dated&amp;mdash;but I decided against it. For all I knew it was nothing, and there was no reason to worry her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drove to work, and tried to forget about it. I worked on getting my office situated to my liking, and was about to call Fay to meet me for lunch when two men in dark suits knocked on the open door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dr. George?” they asked. (No, that&amp;rsquo;s not my real name. You won&amp;rsquo;t find my real name.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes?” I repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is Mr. Rein, and I&amp;rsquo;m Mr. Frol,” one of them said. If you asked me now, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to tell you which was which. They were both middle aged white men, brown hair, clean shaven, and wearing dark sunglasses. &amp;ldquo;You may have received an email from our company server by mistake last night. Did you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to cut it off here. The family whose WiFi I&amp;rsquo;m ripping off have looked out the window four times at my car, and now someone has a phone in their hand. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to be more careful next time. I&amp;rsquo;ll be back as soon as I can. Stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;august-16th-2014-1&#34;&gt;August 16th, 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, back everybody. I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit more careful this time; I&amp;rsquo;m still hijacking this family&amp;rsquo;s WiFi to post this and browse reddit a little, but I&amp;rsquo;m here in the middle of the day now. The only one home (from what I can see) is the wife/mom, and she hasn&amp;rsquo;t noticed me yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you are probably wondering why I even bother to drive 40 minutes to do this&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m not comfortable even writing this out on my home network, let alone posting it from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in 60 different cities since this happened, and I like where I am now. I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to move again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when I had to cut out last time, I had just been approached by two men in suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I had never been so appreciative of my grandparents teaching me to play poker. I frowned and looked upward to the left, acting like I was trying to remember. (In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering, the idea that looking up &amp;amp; to the left suggests telling the truth while the opposite suggests lying is a myth. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop people from believing it, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told them I had gotten it, but that I had marked it as spam and deleted it. &amp;ldquo;Would you mind showing us?” one of them asked. He smiled and took his sunglasses off, probably in an attempt to appear more cordial. The second kept his glasses on, which made it impossible to see where he was looking. &amp;ldquo;If we don&amp;rsquo;t ask, our bosses are guaranteed to give us hell for it,” No-Sunglasses said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agreed, and logged on to my university email. I pulled up the trash folder, and showed them the (apparently) unread email. &amp;ldquo;We really do apologize for this,” the first man said. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve been installing new internal servers and we&amp;rsquo;ve been having trouble with stored addresses and queuing emails. The new system is meant to automatically find the correct email address, but it&amp;rsquo;s been attaching wrong domain names to IDs that are close.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They watched as I deleted it totally, and seemed content. Each of them shook my hand, reminded me that the email was under corporate nondisclosure, and walked out. As soon as they were gone, I shut the door and collapsed into the chair at the computer. What kind of company was this? How in the world did they find me, find where I worked, and send people in less than 24 hours? I looked at the USB stick in my bag, but didn&amp;rsquo;t touch it. In some weird way I worried I had damned myself with it, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t shake the feeling that it would end up being more important than not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished up my workday, and headed home. The next day was Saturday, and we needed to mow. While some of you might think &amp;ldquo;Why would mowing take a whole day?” I can only respond by saying that one of the downsides of having land is taking care of it. We had two tractors so that Fay and I could mow at the same time and finish in as little time as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I explain what happened that Saturday, you need to understand something: without fail, I serviced those tractors every time after we used them. I cleaned the mower decks, sharpened the blades when they needed it, and double checked the engine. I checked oil and gas before AND after using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m a little OCD. It&amp;rsquo;s been of more help than harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fay and I each typically used the same tractor, but she had told me that her tractor had felt like it was pulling to the left instead of going straight ahead. I told her to use mine, and that I would check it out. She started the tractor, and began to mow our field. The tractor worked fine for about 15 minutes, then the engine began to splutter and cough. I noticed it, and waved for Fay to stop. She did, shutting the tractor off and starting to walk towards me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several things happened all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood up, walking to meet my wife halfway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fay walked towards me smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a dark maroon sedan slow down as it drove past our house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tractor exploded behind my wife into a fireball. Pieces of metal and rubber flew in every direction, and the shockwave knocked Fay forward onto the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blast of heat hit me full in the face, and felt like I had dropped face-first into a bonfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran to her, scared shitless. She was fine, though the wind had been knocked out of her. I moved her to the garage, told her to call 911, and ran back to the burning husk of my tractor with a fire extinguisher. I used the entire extinguisher, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the blaze to totally stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few hours were a blur. The fire department showed up, followed by police. The neighbors gawked from their front porches, and we were asked the same questions again and again. The cops asked if either of us had any reason to suspect foul play&amp;mdash;God help me, I should have mentioned the meeting with the two men at work and the email, but I kept my mouth shut. What would I have said, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well gee Officer, I received an email last night from a company making a biological weapon out of Ebola and today two men in dark suits showed up at work to ask me about it in a vaguely threatening manner?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have laughed at that myself, had someone else said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time everyone had left, we were exhausted and starving. We loaded up the puppy into my car and went to Fay&amp;rsquo;s parents&amp;rsquo; place, where her dad cooked on the grill and I got lectured on the importance of taking care of my tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, I did. Still do. There was NO reason for that tractor to explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we went back to our home. There was a huge circle of blackened dirt and burnt grass in the field where the tractor had exploded, but otherwise there was no sign of the circus that had filled our lives only a few hours earlier. Fay was exhausted, and she went straight to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep. I kept running over every check to the tractor that I had done, trying to see where I could have gone wrong. The fuel lines weren&amp;rsquo;t loose, no matter what my father-in-law insinuated. There had been NO reason for it to explode. Now properly feeling my paranoia, I needed to double-check the other major property that I gave my OCD an outlet on: the guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I owned guns. I grew up around them, and they&amp;rsquo;re only tools. Treat it with the proper respect, and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a shotgun in the living room, on top of the television stand. There was a handgun in the kitchen, a holster screwed into the bottom of the cupboards behind the fluorescent light for the counter, and a revolver my wife kept on her nightstand. Lastly, I kept a Mare&amp;rsquo;s Leg in the basement, hidden in the pantry behind rows of mason jars filled with pears and peaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cleaned these every Sunday, disassembling them and making sure they were in order. As I walked through the house checking each gun, the firing pins were missing. Let me repeat that&amp;mdash;the firing pins, from the guns I cleaned every Sunday like clockwork, were missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only gun that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with was the Mare&amp;rsquo;s Leg downstairs; the lines of dust hadn&amp;rsquo;t even been disrupted, and the gun was still able to fire without complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back upstairs and sat in the living room, trying to let my wife rest while I had a panicked breakdown. In the span of less than 24 hours, I had learned a company was apparently making a biological Ebola weapon, been confronted by men in suits who claimed to represent said company, had one of my tractors explode nearly killing my wife, and had come home to find someone had tampered with my belongings in an attempt to make me unable to defend myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the fuck was going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first concern was for Fay: was someone targeting both of us? Just her? How would I be able to protect her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought back over the day, and remembered the maroon sedan that had been driving past when the tractor exploded. There was nothing noteworthy about it, but an instinct told me to watch for it again. I added &amp;ldquo;gun shop” to the errand list on the fridge and went to sleep, resolving to keep an eye out for the sedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next weeks, I recognized a pattern of three distinct cars following my wife and I around town. There was a black Honda, the maroon sedan, and a dark blue motorcycle. When I would take the puppy outside, one would inevitably drive down the road while I was outside. When we would go to the movies, one would be parked within five spaces of our car. I even started to notice them at family gatherings, driving past when one of my cousin&amp;rsquo;s had a birthday party or when we visited Fay&amp;rsquo;s grandmother at the nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, more accidents began to occur around our home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat would miraculously go out, only for a repairman to say that we lucked out &amp;ldquo;because if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t come when I did, you&amp;rsquo;d have a pretty serious buildup of carbon monoxide here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The springs on the garage doors suddenly began failing, almost crushing the puppy when I was working outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power brakes went out in my car, forcing me to cruise down the breakdown lane on the highway until I eased to a stop and put the emergency brake on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did they know, somehow, that I had downloaded that information and kept it? Were these really accidents, or attempts on my life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three weeks of this, I got out of bed in the middle of the night and checked the guns again. No missing pieces, and I sat in the dark to think. Deleting the information wouldn&amp;rsquo;t help; if they knew I had it, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know I deleted it. If push came to shove, it was the only leverage I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email had come to me by mistake, so it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be logical to assume Fay had read it. She had been on the tractor I usually used when it exploded&amp;mdash;it was clear to me that I had been meant to be on it, not her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;accidents” had only started around the house since the visit by the two men, Rein and Frol. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen them again in person, but the trio of vehicles were ever-present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real part of me wanted to take my guns and go hunting, but this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the Wild West. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to risk someone getting shot in crossfire, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if the police would accept my story. If this company had the capacity to find me in less than twenty-four hours, how could I be sure they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fabricate evidence against me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I tell Fay about all of this? She was my wife, my partner; I knew she&amp;rsquo;d be in my corner one hundred percent, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t risk her safety. Looking back, I know this sounds chauvinist. I&amp;rsquo;m not&amp;mdash;Fay was more talented than I was in a lot of areas &amp;ndash; but I was raised to believe that a man protects his family, no matter what. Discounting the problems with the ventilation systems, everything that had happened was directed at me. If I told her, she&amp;rsquo;d become as legitimate a target as I apparently was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as these people kept trying to&amp;hellip;proactively silence a leak, I suppose would be their way of saying it, my wife was in danger of being collateral damage. Her remaining that way was not an option, and I had to think of a way to ensure her safety permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was out of options, at least the ones that left me in a position I wanted to be in&amp;mdash;namely with my wife, safe, in the life we had built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only option I had left that would keep me alive and keep my wife and family safe was one I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do: I had to disappear. Vanish, out of the clear blue sky, and make it as close to impossible as I could to follow me. Once I was off the grid, I could find a way to either expose the company or make some kind of deal with them. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t expect Fay to follow me, nor would I want to expose her to that level of danger. I would have to abandon the love of my life, every accomplishment I had earned, in order to survive this&amp;mdash;at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so fucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;august-16th-2014-2&#34;&gt;August 16th, 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back again&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s just because I miss everything that made life familiar, but this family has really made me smile. Just knowing normal life continues, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt anyone is monitoring r/nosleep, and having some human interaction where I can be honest is refreshing. I never thought anybody would honestly care, so thank you to everyone who has commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in 60 cities, which sounds like a lot. Some were as short as a week, others were a few months&amp;hellip;but once you start moving, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you decide to disappear, it isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as easy as it sounds. Everyone tends to assume that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to drop off the grid totally, to just walk away from the life you&amp;rsquo;ve lived up to that point and choose a new path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;at least, not if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to eventually be found again. It isn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as &amp;ldquo;take the money out of the bank, stop going to work, go to new town.” To give myself a head start, and to make sure it was clear that Fay wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved, I had to do the legwork to provide misinformation to the people chasing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into a whole breakdown of how I managed to vanish. If you really want to plan it for yourself, there are plenty of materials available. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to give an overview, to make it clear how I approached the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I gave business cards and cash to friends who worked overseas. I told them they would be doing me a huge favor, and nobody suspected anything (or if they did, they never voiced their concerns). One went to China, another to Western Europe. Every time they left a card, it was a marker that someone would have to investigate at a cursory level, at least, which would buy time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of our friends had just gotten married, and had went to South America on their honeymoon. When we went to their home for a dinner party, I excused myself and quickly photoshopped tiny photos of my face into the mulling crowds behind the couple&amp;rsquo;s smiling selfies. When the photos were posted on facebook, any kind of facial recognition would (hopefully) find me in the background and again demand some level of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I randomly picked four towns off a map. I bought a prepaid cellphone and, when I should have been working, I looked up apartments for rent in those locations. I called and made appointments to look&amp;mdash;appointments I never intended to keep. I called water services, cable and internet providers, magazine companies&amp;mdash;all to set up subscriptions or knowingly false installation dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the people reading this who recoil and think to themselves, &amp;ldquo;What a jackass,” you can bottle your displeasure. When a company like that comes to a place to make an installation and there isn&amp;rsquo;t anyone there, they simply don&amp;rsquo;t do the installation. It&amp;rsquo;s no skin off their nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the callback numbers on all those appointments, I made sure to give the number to the nearest police or federal authority station. I doubted the people who sent the email would be worried, but I fully intended to make it clear that I was meeting them step for step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every sales plan or rewards program I belonged to, I called and changed my information slightly. I purposefully misspelled my name, or had them &amp;ldquo;fix” my address to one of the four towns I had picked or to a PO box I had prepaid just for this. Everything was done with one reason: to make it as time consuming as possible to hunt down every lead I could place, in order to give me time to find a way out of this mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose the information I had saved on the USB drive from the email, I printed everything out from it twice and sent each set of copies to a different PO box owned by private companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a how-to, but this is an easy way to break it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BOX A (fake everything) &amp;ndash; town I never planned on visiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BOX B (fake everything) &amp;ndash; town I never planned on visiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BOX C (real, sent one copy here) &amp;ndash; town adjacent to a place I was familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BOX D (real, sent one copy here) &amp;ndash; town where I planned on disappearing to, to start with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole time, I had to keep Fay in the dark. It killed me to see her smiling, or playing with the dog, or to hear her murmur &amp;ldquo;I love you” as she fell asleep next to me. If I had been able, I would have rewound until just before I had opened that damn email and continued to sit with her for as long as I was able. I managed to keep my misinformation-building efforts away from her, but the &amp;ldquo;accidents” kept happening. Our oven broke, and the heating element didn&amp;rsquo;t stop getting hotter. I had to shut the power off for the whole house in order to avert a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way to work, the stoplight glitched just as it turned green for me, staying green for the opposing lanes as well. I almost got T-boned by an old man driving a mid-life-crisis-mobile, and had to grip the steering wheel extra tight to keep from yelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One afternoon, Fay took Sigmund (we had finally named our little rescue) out for a walk in the backyard. I heard her scream, and ran outside with the shotgun; I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect, but I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to go down without making a fight of it. She was holding the puppy and shaking, and pointed out to the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even from that distance, I could make out the timber rattler moving through the grass. She told me the puppy had noticed it before she did, and she had barely had time to yank back on the leash and move away before the snake had coiled up onto itself and began rattling. I walked out, aimed, and suddenly there was cooling snake blood all over a five foot circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fay was shaken, and asked me if I had ever seen one before. I answered her no, and while we were technically in the range for one, I had never seen a snake like that in a populated area like where we lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &amp;ldquo;accidents” were getting more and more desperate. I have no doubt that if they had simply wanted me dead, they could have shot me. From my own perspective, it seemed apparent that the desired outcome was to silence me permanently without any foul play being suspected AT ALL. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any time left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disappeared on an early Tuesday morning. I had seen a lawyer previously, and drawn up divorce papers. I gave Fay everything short of a few hundred dollars. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to divorce her, but I had to keep propping up the fact that she didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about E-7x or plans to weaponize Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kissed her on the cheek as she slept, and quietly got dressed. I had slowly been packing for a few days&amp;mdash;a bar of soap here, a shirt there&amp;mdash;and was ready to go without more packing. As I got up, Sigmund yawned and looked up at me, his tail wagging. I had to bite my tongue to keep from crying as I scratched behind his ears and kissed him, trying to commit to memory his smell and the feel of Fay&amp;rsquo;s skin under my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed the divorce papers and left them on the kitchen counter. I tried to write a note, to give SOME kind of explanation&amp;hellip;but nothing came, at least nothing that would keep her safely ignorant of what I had to leave. I ended up writing &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I&amp;rsquo;ll always love you” and left it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left behind everything I had loved, in a last-ditch effort to keep them all safe. It was lonely, and terrifying. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the run ever since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine years. Nine long fucking lonely years. I never stopped moving in the first two years, staying in one place for no more than two months before packing up and moving. I worked odd jobs, always got paid under the table in cash, and lied with a smile every time someone asked where I was from or about the ring I wore around my neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried three times, over the years, to get the evidence I have to people who might be able to help me. Two were politicians, and one was a newsperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect you&amp;rsquo;ll recognize their names: Larry Craig, Anthony Weiner, and Tim Russert. I picked the politicians not because they were tough on bioweapons or the &amp;ldquo;vast military-industrial complex,” but because they represented states far from my home state. When I reached out to Craig on August 23rd, his staff seemed remote but interested. Four days after, I turned on the radio and heard that Roll Call was reporting that he had been arrested for lewd conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went underground again after that for the better part of a year, moving and always keeping an eye over my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Russert next, contacting his staff and explaining that I had a story that I would only trust to Russert himself. I was a fan of &amp;ldquo;Meet the Press” for a number of years, and always appreciated that he never seemed to play favorites. In the back of my mind, I daydreamed about my life turning out like something from &amp;ldquo;The Pelican Brief;” reuniting with Fay, seeing my parents again, my old employers offering my job back out of pride for my accomplishments. I heard back from them on June 10th of 2008, where his chief of staff explained that Tim would be contacting me personally to set up a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 13th, Russert died of an apparent heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cleared out my meager apartment and was on the next Greyhound bus out of town the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I left the US for several years. It was easier to hide in more populated areas, and while my facility with other languages was never fantastic, I knew enough to pass by. I crossed back into the country in late 2010, and decided to attempt to go public again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted a junior congressman from New York this time, someone on the opposing side of the political aisle from my first attempt. I actually spoke with Weiner myself, and he offered me protection and his full support in exchange for the information I had. We verbally agreed, and I even travelled to NYC to meet him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had agreed to meet in a nondescript corner restaurant, but he never showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited for an hour, but nothing. My off-the-grid instincts were screaming, and I vanished into a dive bar. On the TV, I saw the story&amp;mdash;a sex scandal, where Weiner had been having online affairs. His credibility was totally shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished my beer, and disappeared out of the city again. I&amp;rsquo;ve been underground ever since, and this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve used any kind of &amp;ldquo;social media” since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve come to my secondary reason for posting this. I know Fay got remarried. I know my mother still holds a ceremony for me every year on my birthday, and my father died without knowing what happened to his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Fay was into reddit from the start of the site, and this subreddit is exactly the kind of thing she would be into. It&amp;rsquo;s remote, a one-in-a-million chance, but there&amp;rsquo;s a possibility that she could read this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fay, if you are, please know I love you. I&amp;rsquo;ve never stopped loving you. I never wanted to hurt you, and everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done has been to keep you safe. I know you haven&amp;rsquo;t sold the house yet&amp;mdash;I lurk online using proxies and public internet access. There&amp;rsquo;s a lockbox buried under the third fence post away from the road. It has the first book we ever read to each other, and a handwritten copy of my wedding vows. I had hoped to give it to you on our thirtieth wedding anniversary, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t looking likely. Do what you want with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;august-22nd-2014&#34;&gt;August 22nd, 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I can&amp;rsquo;t stay here long. I wanted to address a few things in a longer post, but events have happened that make that no longer an option. This will be my last update in a very, very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up this morning, I turned on the radio and realized I fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fucked up badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family I had been skipping internet off of suffered a home invasion last night. The news is reporting that a team of four masked men stormed into their house at three in the morning. The invaders shot the family&amp;rsquo;s dog, killing it instantly. They proceeded to torture the family, shooting the husband/father in the stomach and forcing the wife/mom and two kids to watch him bleed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time police were able to arrive, the invaders were gone. They murdered him, and cut off three of the eldest child&amp;rsquo;s fingers. Police reports are saying the intruders are asking about a man with my description, though the family didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because I stole their internet and posted this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m waiting at a bus station now. I need to disappear again, though hopefully I can manage to do something for the family whose lives I managed to totally fuck up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of your comments about going to wikileaks, of &amp;ldquo;being a hero.” Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing&amp;mdash;I never wanted to be a hero, and you can call me a coward if you want. All I wanted was a normal life with my wife and a dog and 2.5 kids. I need to find a way back to that, if at all possible. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a video game or an action movie&amp;mdash;I can&amp;rsquo;t just walk into a building with a gun and automatically assume everyone will recognize me as &amp;ldquo;the protagonist,&amp;rdquo; nor can I just walk into a newspaper or TV station and have my life be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted wikileaks once, to assuage my fears after what happened with Russert. In the 24 hours it took them to contact me, there were men in the town I was in at the time already asking around about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t worth my life, and that&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t contacted Fay. Her new husband is old money, and she seems fine. I saw some of you suspect that he&amp;rsquo;s in on this somehow, but I doubt it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to find a way to slip some kind of message to her, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the person who claimed to be the company and said my trip to Europe didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything&amp;mdash;if you&amp;rsquo;re real, thanks for proving it did. I never went to Europe, you idiots. Facial recognition will never outpace the human element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, to the people claiming to be companies hired by my wife to &amp;ldquo;indulge my paranoid delusions,” I congratulate you on your imagination. That&amp;rsquo;s it. I wish I could laugh it off as easily as you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think they would chase any of you, but watch your back for a few days just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, reddit. Thanks for listening, and for giving me some solid human contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, Fay. Forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the 25th March, at 14:57GMT, the world stopped for 27 minutes and 54 seconds. No one noticed at first. Those that eventually did were ordered to keep quiet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no sudden jolt, no collapsing into unconsciousness, no transition into utter darkness and back again. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone, time had appeared to pass as normal, one second moving uneventfully into the next. Birds flew, people talked, the wind and the rain blew and fell respectively - nothing had occurred to indicate that anything untoward or unexpected had happened to the inhabitants of the Earth. Only those who looked beyond our planet and its ring of constantly chattering satellites now found that the rest of the universe told a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA and related space agencies noticed first. Signals to ongoing missions beyond those in orbit around the Earth were all off by almost 30 minutes. Frantic investigation revealed that the same time discrepancy was occurring for all incoming signals. Naturally they came to the conclusion that the problem must therefore lay not with these external elements, but with the computers on Earth. But this led to a bigger question - one computer glitch was possible, but all of the various space agency&amp;rsquo;s computers across the globe showing the same failure at exactly the same time? Naturally, a virus or a sophisticated global hacking attack was the next obvious answer. An international team to investigate such a large, well-coordinated cyber-attack was being discussed when the first calls of alarm came in from confused and concerned astronomers, and the true significance of what had actually happened became known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data retrieved from telescopic arrays at Jodrell Bank, Palo Alto, Mount Pleasant and others across the world, confirmed against existing stellar records and computational models of the local galaxy and beyond, it became apparent that for twenty seven minutes and fifty four seconds the Earth had somehow been out of sync with the rest of known time and space. In essence, the world as we knew it had winked out of existence during this period, and then returned as if nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all intents and purposes during that short window of time, we had ceased to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international investigation team was repurposed, a blank cheque written, giving it its pick of resources and the best minds in their fields, all to investigate this one event and all sworn to the utmost secrecy. None of them needed to be told the panic that would ensue if this information became public before a suitable, and hopefully reassuring, reason could be given for the event. Those that couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep silent were quickly and quietly silenced themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the various project names assigned to the sub teams, those involved began referring to the event in a half joking manner as ‘&amp;hellip;the day God blinked.&amp;rsquo; In casual conversation between project members this was eventually shortened even further to just ‘the blink.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six rings, Ben finally answered the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mark! What are you doing here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You invited me, remember?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did I?! How odd! Well, I probably had a reason at the time. It&amp;rsquo;s still good to see you anyway. Come on in!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d known Ben since childhood. We attended the same schools for a while, before his crazily high IQ led him onto a fast track of higher education and beyond. We kept in touch though; his parents were sensible enough to realize he needed some grounding in the real world, and encouraged our friendship with the usual sleepovers and camping trips. Their smarts lay in forcing Ben not to let his social skills atrophy completely like a lot of very intelligent kids were wont to do. As a result, whilst he was frequently side tracked and forgetful, he still functioned in normal society with a degree of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our respective schooling had finished we both moved into the IT industry, although at vastly different levels. For myself, I now worked in tech support, mostly maintaining insurance systems for a range of small independent companies. Boring, but it paid well and allowed me to travel. He, on the other hand, was self-employed and preferred working from his &amp;lsquo;Apartment of Solitude&amp;rsquo; as he called it, referring to himself as a ‘Consulting Technician&amp;rsquo; (he&amp;rsquo;d gotten the idea from watching re-runs of ‘Sherlock&amp;rsquo;). His work was a lot more varied and advanced, and whilst he never openly admitted to hacking, he certainly had enough technical knowledge and experience to have been employed in the past by such names as Google, Microsoft and IBM when they needed someone to test the all new, unshakable security they&amp;rsquo;d just put in place, or track down those that had subsequently been able to breach their all new, unshakable security. He preferred the latter work he told me; it added the ‘thrill of the chase&amp;rsquo;, plus it usually paid better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was less well known was the work he occasionally did ‘off the books&amp;rsquo; for such groups as the Department of Defense and the NSA. He admitted his working for them was twofold: one, they wanted his expertise and brilliance, and two, it allowed them to keep tabs on his expertise and brilliance. He didn&amp;rsquo;t mind this as he explained once:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, it keeps them happy knowing where I am and what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. Or at least what they THINK I&amp;rsquo;m doing,&amp;rdquo; and then he&amp;rsquo;d grin and pass me the latest decoded email he&amp;rsquo;d intercepted. He didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything with the stuff he found, he just enjoyed the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, sometimes it was hard to pin down just who Ben was and what his motivations were from one moment to the next. I&amp;rsquo;d just grown up accepting him and his eccentricities, quickly coming to the conclusion his life was a complex pattern of impulses and ideas, woven together from threads that were as much madness as genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was his belief that every time someone said ‘Abracadabra&amp;rsquo;, an angel lost its wings, or that the common cold existed as a vast, hive mentality that avoided detection by its elements constantly hopping from body to body. Mad, crazy shit like that. Half the time I thought he was joking; for the rest I just hoped he had enough common sense to rein it in when in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there were the times he did and said things that ended up on the opposite end of that, when what he said made absolute, unnerving sense. On those occasions he spoke with a lucidity that seemed to cut through all the crap humankind had built around its certainties and beliefs, as if he&amp;rsquo;d touched on some universal truth we should all by rights know. All I could do at those times was marvel at how someone with such a kaleidoscope for a brain, entertaining such a maelstrom of contradictory thoughts constantly, could suddenly bring all those elements together to produce those single blindingly white lights of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he&amp;rsquo;d suddenly go off on a tangent, accusing his neighbours of being CIA agents trialling neurotoxins on the local cats and we&amp;rsquo;d be back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I came at his summons. Despite the crazed theories and odd habits, it was definitely the most entertaining conversation around, plus his library of illegally downloaded films was truly a wonder to behold. That, and he was my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during a piece of work for NASA, idling through their secure systems looking for proof of Area 51 during his off time, that led him to first discover and then piece together all the facts concerning March 25th and the ‘blink&amp;rsquo; found by the international team so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being his only close friend, he&amp;rsquo;d decided to fill me in on this ongoing conspiracy, mainly so he could show off his talents once more, hence the invitation. As he spoke he appeared completely oblivious to how my face was gradually growing more and more incredulous. He described what the world&amp;rsquo;s space agencies and astronomers had discovered, and how a secret scientific think tank was now investigating what had happened. Physicists, Quantum theorists, Mathematicians&amp;hellip; the whole spectrum of sciences, all focused on this one problem and the questions associated with it: what had happened, why it had happened, and most importantly, was it likely to happen again, and if so, what was the risk of it being permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me of the total news blackout and how any amateur astronomers or similar who now came to the same conclusions were to be either brought on board, treated as cranks, or disappeared with extreme prejudice. Their biggest fear was a mass panic he said, or the world&amp;rsquo;s religions taking credit on behalf of their respective Gods and several genocidal wars kicking off as a result. As he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more disconcerting I guess then not being able to trust your own reality. We&amp;rsquo;ve been raised in a world where it&amp;rsquo;s fine to distrust your government, your employers, even your family, but your own entire existence?! Definitely a recipe for chaos.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Places like CERN have been placed on almost permanent hiatus. The governments of the world have no proof experiments like the ones they were doing there are the cause, but then I suppose they had to point the finger somewhere until more evidence showed up. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of theoretical work being done now, but pretty much zero practical. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before they get the scriptwriters in from Doctor Who to brainstorm a possible cause.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighed at this, sat back in his swivel chair and spun round, gazing at the ceiling seemingly lost in thought, then he slowly came to a stop and returned his gaze to me, a mischievous twinkle in his eyes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then on the other side, you have all the religions&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this he paused again, looked around his cluttered desk, and then started building what looked like a tower of various bits and pieces. As it slowly grew in height, he continued speaking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Remember our bible classes? I liked the stories, if not the morality. I especially liked the story of Babel&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising structure of books, hard drives, chocolate bars, magazines and other random items his hands could find in reach had risen to a height just below his chin. He added a few more items, adding to the precarious sway it already had. Pausing again, his hands not touching it but spread wide on either side ready to stop any imminent collapse; he attempted the voice of an old English vicar delivering a sermon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Man in his hubris decided to build a tower to God, so he may converse with his creator! God though, in his glorious wisdom, decided man should not be allowed to do this and took steps to rectify the situation. So he cursed mankind with the gift of many tongues!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smirked at this, his eyes never leaving his tower, and returned to his normal voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, many a project, plan or peace has been ruined by the inability of people to understand each other. It might be that humanity is over reaching itself again. With the final proof of the existence of the Higgs-Boson, maybe God&amp;rsquo;s decided we&amp;rsquo;re getting too close again, and he&amp;rsquo;s selfish about his tricks. Time for another lesson perhaps?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this he slowly closed his hands into fists on either side of the precarious edifice he had created, then with a single finger gingerly pushed it near the top. With a crash, his metaphorical tower scattered across the table and the floor. He waited until the sound of the books and rubbish falling had died away before speaking again, this time in a thoughtful voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maybe the ‘blink&amp;rsquo; as they call it was God giving us a heads up, a warning to stop encroaching on his intellectual property, else risk the consequences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he grinned, his tried and true atheism once more reasserting itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personally, looking at all the facts so far accumulated, I believe the answer lies even further afield,&amp;rdquo; he said, a knowing smile on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a comfort break at this point, shaking my head at this new conspiracy theory. When I got back, he&amp;rsquo;d moved on already, his head now buried in the side of a PC tower case now perched on a different desk he reserved for ‘mechanical endeavours.&amp;rsquo; It was quiet for a while, broken only by his humming as he fiddled inside the case whilst I looked for somewhere reasonably clean to sit. Then abruptly he spoke again, his voice oddly masked by the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As I was saying, I believe the answers they seek lie further afield. I have statistical proof in fact.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Statistics?! You?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;d often laughed at statistics in the past, and blamed them for 63.75% of the world&amp;rsquo;s ills (in his mad pedantry, he had indeed worked out a formula that he said proved this figure). That being said, he told me once he could destroy the world with a single spreadsheet, and in my more fatalistic moments I honestly believed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I accept, statistics in all their perceived infallibility, are the most fallible things in the world,&amp;rdquo; he mumbled from inside the case, reaching aimlessly for a screwdriver on the desk next to him with a hand coloured orange and black from a mix of grease and Cheetos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take a work of fiction and add numbers to it, and suddenly it becomes non-fiction. Add a pie chart and a graph and it becomes an inviolate truth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bollocks,&amp;rdquo; said I, only half listening as I lounged on a large dirty bean bag littered with wrappers and the odd wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;d then retracted his head from the case, looked me in the eyes and said with a devilish glint in his own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pass it to the right people in the right places at the right time, and it becomes law.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hmmm,&amp;rdquo; I replied, deciding not to entertain his paranoid fantasies further in favor of a magazine I&amp;rsquo;d just found on the floor amongst all the other junk haphazardly discarded as part of his less than ordered, less than sanitary, lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grunted at my lack of enthusiasm for continuing one of his favorite topics, and buried his head back in the tower case once more before continuing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;However, in those cases I am referring to your basic, biased statistics. Marketing, pressure group, political&amp;hellip; that kind of unreliable crap. Now pattern recognition, that element within the field of otherwise exploitable statistics, THAT I do have time for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting his head again, he looked around the desk the case was on, shifting papers this way and that as he continued, partially lost in thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve heard of SETI of course&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hold on&amp;hellip; if we&amp;rsquo;re heading into alien territory, you can kiss my ass right here and now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fixed me with a glare, and I threw my hands up in the air in resignation, muttering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, please continue oh knowledgeable one!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you. SETI, the search for extraterrestrial life, one of their jobs being the analysis of signals bouncing in and around our local galaxy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of which they have never found any conclusive proof of intelligent life,&amp;rdquo; I reminded him pointedly. He ignored me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if the patterns they&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for are wrong? What if you could analyze these seemingly random signals another way. What if there is a pattern, but it&amp;rsquo;s spread over a longer period so you don&amp;rsquo;t even see it as a pattern. Ah ha!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triumphantly his hand came out of a pile of books clutching a pad of post-it notes, scattering the books across the desk in doing so. Fishing a pen from his trouser pocket, I saw him scribble ‘To Do&amp;rsquo; on the top note and slap it on the side of the tower&amp;rsquo;s case, before turning around to face me with an excited grin on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you been watching the Discovery Channel again? Is there a UFO special on this week?&amp;rdquo; I asked pointedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at me indignantly, though I noticed he quickly closed a TV guide that had been open on his desk amongst the mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if I told you I had written my own pattern recognition algorithm? What if I told you that I had found a message in those signals?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bullshit,&amp;rdquo; I said quietly, suddenly less sure of myself, now more than a little shaken by what this meant if he had indeed succeeded in discovering a message from an alien race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy,&amp;rdquo; he continued, feigning an air of false modesty, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;and I do have the NSA to thank. Although if they discover I&amp;rsquo;ve been running this algorithm in the background on their decryption supercomputer, then I may have to leave abruptly, or apologize. You never can tell what mood they&amp;rsquo;ll be in one day to the next&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ben. What about the message?&amp;rdquo; I said firmly, cutting him short, standing to face him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh. That.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went quiet, looking around evasively. My doubts quickly returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What was the message Ben?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, it was short, and it is really rather impressive decoding anything like this obviously&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ben!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused, and then said abjectly: &amp;ldquo;Hello. Are you content?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a few seconds silence, before I started laughing uncontrollably, mostly out of relief. Ben looked indignant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very poignant message. Better than ‘Prepare to be annihilated&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh god&amp;hellip; hold on a sec&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t breathe! You had me shitting myself for a moment there!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I take it then you don&amp;rsquo;t believe what I&amp;rsquo;ve found is a message from an alien race? Would you PLEASE stop laughing!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. Ahhhhhhh&amp;hellip; Ben, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to admit, if you were to imagine contact from another species, I think I&amp;rsquo;d be looking for something a little more, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, profound? I mean, we&amp;rsquo;ve sent out a gold disk giving a snapshot of the human race and our knowledge. Music, mathematics, you name it. And what do the hyper-intelligent aliens send back? The equivalent of ‘Have a Nice Day!&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s from outer space then?&amp;rdquo; he reiterated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at his pained expression and answered in a more reasonable voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look Ben, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. I think your algorithm found a pattern that wasn&amp;rsquo;t there, and extrapolated meaning from it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning, I returned to the bean bag and my perusal of the magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood there a few moments, and then he turned and flopped down in a large, comfortable swivel chair behind another desk, this one littered with laptops in various states of construction and destruction, connected by an array of cables in what appeared like haphazard fashion. Pressing the on switches of three of them, his face was illuminated in the telltale glow of their screens. His focus flitting between the screens and his fingers dancing across the keyboard in front of him, he had nevertheless decided to continue, and began outlining his newest theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I disagree. I&amp;rsquo;ll go even further and state that this is an alien species with an interest in the human race. A species directly involved in the evolution of mankind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here we go. Are we really back on the ‘Engineers&amp;rsquo; theory once more? Has Ridley Scott been sending you secret messages in his films again?&amp;rdquo; I muttered, not looking up from the page I was now reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ignored this and continued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Think about it. The human body is an amazing machine. It regulates itself, heals itself, and has the ability to create more of itself through reproduction&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I thought you only believed in things you had experienced for yourself?&amp;rdquo; I asked; peering over the top of the magazine at him, my voice now openly amused. I saw him scowl before he continued with his monologue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, the human body is an amazing machine. And that is exactly what it is. A piece of technology, built using biological parts rather than mechanical ones. It is not however, a perfect machine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo; I asked despite myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;Well, think about it. It has its own defensive capabilities in the form of white blood cells to ward off illness, the ability to heal wounds, etc, etc. Occasionally though, this excellent piece of machinery goes wrong; it functions incorrectly. It has a faulty piece of code if you will. The immune system could start overreacting, attacking normal healthy cells, or maybe it fails in it&amp;rsquo;s job in attacking the defective ones it should be dealing with, letting them grow and expand unchecked.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;Such as?&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;Why, cancer of course!&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;What?!&amp;rdquo; I asked, shocked despite myself. It was only another crazy conversation with Ben, but the word ‘cancer&amp;rsquo; always sent an involuntary shiver down my spine. I&amp;rsquo;d seen enough of its effects on friends and family to be adverse to even its mentioning. Ben though, oblivious to my discomfort, had continued: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;Cancer is just one example of the body failing to perform it&amp;rsquo;s defined function, an internal failure of a biological system. A mistake, nothing more.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;We have in essence, a design flaw, and if our God or Gods are supposedly infallible, then logic dictates we were not built by a benign omnipotent being, but rather are constructs of more fallible ones. Action should have been taken to rectify these errors. To complain if you will.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Despite myself, I took another look over the magazine at him; nervous now for a reason I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite put my finger on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What. Did. You. Do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why, I sent a message back telling them this of course!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen Ben in six months. Work had kept me busy in London, and he wasn&amp;rsquo;t one for texting or casual telephone conversations to catch up. Then one day he called me up suddenly to come visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, snippets of information about ‘the blink&amp;rsquo; had begun to leak out onto the internet, on even some of the more respected sites and journals. Most normal people saw it as just another mad conspiracy theory. Having spoken to Ben before though when he&amp;rsquo;d outlined all the data, the fact that other sources were now relaying the same information sent chills through me. It was one thing for it being just another of his crazy theories, but quite another when a growing number of external bodies were now seeming to confirm the event&amp;rsquo;s existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time when I rang his doorbell he answered on the first ring, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for the sight when he opened the door. He was haggard and tired, like he hadn&amp;rsquo;t slept in days, and his clothes were rumpled and dirty, even more so than normal. As I stood there I caught a look in his eyes. They were bloodshot and there were large, dark circles under them, but there was a calm I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before, which was echoed in his voice as he welcomed me in. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite put my finger on it at first, but then it dawned on me; I had seen and heard this kind of response before in those who were in the final stages of terminal illness: Acceptance. I felt my body prickle with unease; that chill that ripples across your skin when you stop thinking in the past or the future and all your attention is suddenly focused on the NOW because you know the world you&amp;rsquo;re used to is about to change in some fundamental way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paused in the doorway, and looked him in the eyes. Then without thinking I drew him into a massive bear hug. Ben had never been one for physical contact in all the time I&amp;rsquo;d know him, but he accepted the hug without question, and I felt some of the tension release from him. We parted after a short while and I asked him sincerely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you okay? Nothing wrong with you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No&amp;hellip; No&amp;hellip; Nothing physically at least.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good. Good, because you look like shit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laughed weakly at that, and then quieted. We stood there silently for a few moments, before the thought that had been nagging at my mind since he&amp;rsquo;d invited me forced itself out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed on the web there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of noise about this ‘blink&amp;rsquo; thing you mentioned last time. I was wondering&amp;hellip; did you get an answer?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smiled weakly, ignoring my question, inviting me in and simply pointing me to the large bean bag for me to sit, as I had done so many times before. If anything, his apartment was even messier than the last time, but somehow the impression of organized chaos was gone. This was just mess that had been left to accumulate, like the owner no longer cared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sat down, he went over to a desk and fiddled with a laptop, moved some random items on the desk, almost like he was stalling. Then turning to face me, resting himself against the desk, he asked me in a vague voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you remember what I was talking about the last time you visited?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You mean the alien thing?&amp;rdquo; I answered, trying to make my voice sound light, the smirk on my face forced and obviously fake. I&amp;rsquo;d given in to his suspicions and he knew it. Before he would&amp;rsquo;ve rubbed this fact in my face, but today he didn&amp;rsquo;t. Such things didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter to him anymore, which made my voiceless fears even greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not just humanity, but all life on Earth, has been engineered. An external source created it, and maintained it. It is my belief&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; at this he laughed a dry mocking laugh at his use of a word he had previously despised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is my belief now that the Earth has experienced various ‘stages&amp;rsquo; of life. There have probably been several of these stages, back from when Earth was first formed, up to and including today. Of these earlier ‘versions&amp;rsquo; we have no substantial evidence of. The last one before us though, we do have several indicators lying around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left it hanging, waiting for my mind to catch up. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long, although I was surprised at how easily I was accepting what was possibly another one of his eccentric theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You mean the dinosaurs don&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo; I said quietly; his restraint somehow infecting me as well now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small smile arranged itself on his lips again, though the sadness never left his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Indeed. Those big stumbling sods before us. For the sake of clarity, I&amp;rsquo;ve classed them as Version 5.0 of life on Earth. We are Version 6.0 I now have reason to believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What about your message, did you get an answer?&amp;rdquo; I asked again, a bit more impatiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not just my message. The Earth&amp;rsquo;s been sending radio signals and more out for quite a few years now. If we can find their signals as I&amp;rsquo;ve proven, they can certainly pick up ours, even the unintended ones.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you trying to say Ben?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That they got our messages, and they took action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to swallow now in a dry throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What action?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You work in technical support. What is usually your first recommendation when something stops working correctly?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; usually turning it off and back on again does the trick in the majority of cases&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this my voice trailed off as I realized what he was implying, what this said about March 25th and the lost 27 minutes and 54 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben started laughing, trailing off into a sad cough as he saw what he&amp;rsquo;d said take hold in my mind. Then he suddenly went off at a tangent, just like the old days, and I listened despite the sick feeling in the pit of my stomach at what I was now thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chariots of the Gods! Chariots of the frigging Gods! Imagine that. Aliens coming down to teach ancient civilizations new tricks. Or maybe they didn&amp;rsquo;t. Maybe Version 6.0 was still under warranty at the time and part of that warranty included on-site maintenance. Hell, my money&amp;rsquo;s on the Greek gods actually being extraterrestrial consultants sent down to fix bug problems. Makes you wonder which fucked up piece of code triggered Pompeii!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;SHUT UP!&amp;rdquo; I suddenly raged. Maybe he was in one of his mad phases again, but I knew that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t. The sane, logical part of me didn&amp;rsquo;t want any more truth; knew I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up, and Ben was staring at me, not in anger, but in sympathy. He settled down next to me on the bean bag, passing me a beer he had obviously just fished out of the small fridge he kept behind his desk. I took a long swig, let my breathing settle, and then passed it back. Taking that as a cue to continue, he did, but quieter this time, less tinged with the hysterical note that had appeared to be emerging in his speech earlier, like he&amp;rsquo;d reached the peak of his madness and was now trailing off the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It would explain why so many people believed in pantheons of Gods back in the day. Alien engineers popping down to fix ‘the system&amp;rsquo; whilst we were still covered. Just like Microsoft ending support for older versions of Windows though, maybe we just passed the date where Version 6.0 of life on Earth was covered, so they stopped coming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took a swig and passed it back, his voice now wistful, his eyes unfocused, trying to look across the unfathomable void to where he imagined our progenitors resided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And now, in this age of radio and microwave signals, the people of Earth are finally sending messages and emails that can be picked up by their &amp;lsquo;Gods&amp;rsquo;, bemoaning this and that failure with their bodies, their families and the world around them, demanding answers, and these messages tumble out across the ether of space, picked up by some backwater tech support desk in some forgotten nebula. The number of messages reaches a critical mass, a statistical point where action must be taken, and some alien equivalent of a high school dropout named Gary checks a scrap of paper on his desk for the instructions to an age old piece of software&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He downed the rest of his beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;and then turns it off and on again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence reigned for a few minutes, during which he stood up and made another trip to the fridge, this time bringing back several more bottles. He settled back down on the bean bag and passed me one before he spoke again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I got a message back you know,&amp;rdquo; he said simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at him incredulously, and then demanded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus Ben! What did it say?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes were dark, pausing a long while before reaching into his back pocket and slowly unfolding a piece of paper, mumbling something about ‘decryption software&amp;rsquo;, ‘language analysis&amp;rsquo; and ‘Word auto-formatting&amp;rsquo; before passing it to me. It read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear EARTH,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for replying in regard our recent query as to your ongoing happiness with your software. We passed on your multiple concerns to the relevant technical support helpdesk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately ongoing support for your current version of LIFE 6.0 has ended. The initial reboot of your hardware/software attempted previously appears to have not resolved your issue(s). Therefore we will be refreshing your system to previous stable release LIFE 5.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your contract does not include backup/restoration of existing data, so all current data will be wiped post version LIFE 5.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for using LIFE and please contact us if further issues occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Regards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Refresh?&amp;rdquo; was all I could mutter, confusion and dread dulling my senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using the version numbering as a guide, my guess is that would be resetting the Earth back to the late Jurassic period,&amp;rdquo; he murmured thoughtfully, taking another swig of beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I sent a message back of course, asking them not to do anything. I even couched it in the proper terms: ‘We have decided to continue with our current installation, please do not reboot nor refresh the system. Please ignore all other bug reports unless forwarded by me. Ben Glover, Sysadmin of Earth.&amp;rsquo; Hopefully they got it in time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bug reports?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Prayers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I looked at him again, the look of disbelief obvious in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sysadmin of Earth??&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my gaze, but rather sheepishly kept his eyes locked to his beer bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, I had to sound like I was in charge didn&amp;rsquo;t I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you think they got your message?&amp;rdquo; I asked hopefully after a pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know. We can hope though. By my calculations we&amp;rsquo;ll know in the next couple of hours or so. It&amp;rsquo;s why I invited you over I guess. So we can watch the end together. Then again, we might just wink out of existence&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; his voice trailed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence reigned again, broken only by our occasional sips. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t, in all truth, very much else to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while he finished his beer, rested it gently down next to him, and then yawned expansively, leaning back on the bean bag with his hands clasped behind his head and said matter-of-factly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well to be perfectly honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t think the dinosaurs were given a fair enough crack of the whip the first time round. Only right they should be given another go.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned in disbelief to argue with him at this irresponsible attitude, and then saw the barely suppressed laughter in his eyes. When all was said and done, what was there left to do but wait and see what happened, and laugh at the absurdity of it all? He started, and I joined in, till the tears were rolling down our cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there we sat, laughing and drinking beer until our world ended&amp;hellip; maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To: Breeiceq@&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Subject: BREE PLEASE READ THIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BREE, DON&amp;rsquo;T DELETE THIS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you hate me, but we were best friends once and I need you to read this. I think I&amp;rsquo;m in serious trouble and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing you can do, but I need you to read this so that you understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we haven&amp;rsquo;t talked since sectionals. It&amp;rsquo;s been forever, but what happened to you wasn&amp;rsquo;t my fault. At least, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely my fault. I know everyone thinks it was, but I would never do anything to hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to sound crazy, but I need to tell you so that someone knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started when we were in the 8th grade. It was the night before the Crystal Classic competition. I was at home and couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep because I was so nervous about competing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I got on the computer, just sorta surfing the web and stuff, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t concentrate on anything. I was just sitting there. So I googled myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never should have done that, Bree. At first, it was just all the usual stuff you find when you Google yourself; then I found a link to a Wikipedia page about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought our club or my dad made it or something. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much there - just some basic facts about skating and what city I lived in, but the thing that got me was that it said I had won that year&amp;rsquo;s Crystal Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed. I thought for sure someone had only made it to encourage me. I confronted my dad about it, but he denied it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I won the competition the next day, I was so happy. That was the first competition I had ever won and it felt so good. Remember how hard I worked after that? That was when my parents hired Sergei to coach me. You know how much that must have cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I would check my page before every competition, and it would always say where I placed. It said I would win the regionals at 15 and that came true. Afterwards, Sergei convinced my mom and dad that I had a real shot at the Olympics. That was when they pulled me from school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skated every day, but I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t progressing the way Sergei said I needed to if I wanted a shot at the Championship. I was working so hard and skating well, but still Sergei said it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sectionals came, all I could think about was winning, so I did something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. Everyone was saying that you were the favorite and I felt like I had already lost the competition, so I made a Wikipedia account and tried to update my page to say that I was the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is that after I tried to update the page, I checked it, and all it said was: &amp;ldquo;Annora Petrova is a selfish little bitch who is going to get what she deserves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke down. That&amp;rsquo;s why I looked so awful the next day. I was in a daze. I remember watching your routine and seeing your blade snap. The next thing I knew, I was on the ground and my face was covered in blood from where the tip flew off and sliced my forehead. Then they told me it was my fault because I had your skates in my possession earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bree, I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything to your skates. I wanted to win, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything to hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they told me I was banned from any further competitions, everyone said that I got what I deserved. Nobody even asked for my side of the story. I guess you heard that Sergei dropped me after that, too. He said that I ruined him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one would talk to me. Do you know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be ostracized by everyone? I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get ice time. And then the page got worse. Anytime I&amp;rsquo;d check it, it would say all these horrible things about me. I can&amp;rsquo;t even tell you half of them, the language was so vile. I&amp;rsquo;d cry every time I read it, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop checking it. I knew I had to do something, so I made a complaint to Wikipedia. I even tried calling them, but no one there claimed to know anything about the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was home alone that Friday night when I decided to check it to see if it had been taken down. The page was still there, only this time it said: &amp;ldquo;Annora Petrova is a pathetic little orphan.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I freaked. I kept calling my parents to warn them, but every time I did, all I would hear was this horrible laughter on the other end. I must have called them a hundred times until I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take the sound of the laughing anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the accident, the police gave me their phones, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any record of my calls that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was devastated. Before that, I was so busy training all day and doing home school, I never realized just how alone I had been the whole time. I know you tried to reach out, but I was so depressed and angry that I just shut everything out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I turned 18 and got the settlement money from the court, I came to Switzerland. I got to reinvent myself. My skating really took off. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t even been a year and I still feel like everything that happened was so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done it, Bree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing you now from an old hotel outside of Prague. I&amp;rsquo;m auditioning for the Ice Circus tomorrow. I know it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing we used to make fun of, but I really want this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was feeling really nervous, so out of an old habit, I checked my page. It&amp;rsquo;s so hard to say this, but when I read it to see if I&amp;rsquo;d get the job tomorrow, all it said was, &amp;ldquo;Annora Petrova died friendless and alone&amp;rdquo;, and it has today&amp;rsquo;s date listed as the date of my death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sobbing so hard, I can barely type this. But I wanted you to know the truth. Please believe me, Bree. I attached a screenshot of the page. It&amp;rsquo;s all there, just as I told you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone here and nobody speaks English. I keep refreshing the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, it&amp;rsquo;s been forever, I keep refreshing but it still hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed, I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for midnight. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do, so I locked myself in my room. There&amp;rsquo;s only a few minutes to midnight now. All I can do is refresh the page. I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted, but I can&amp;rsquo;t stop. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid to leave the computer until I know what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend Emily died on August 7th of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just received another message, and it&amp;rsquo;s worse than the others. She was involved in a three car crash driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She was dead within minutes at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would&amp;rsquo;ve married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was always happy when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, she wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, &amp;ldquo;If I kark it first, don&amp;rsquo;t just say good things about me. I&amp;rsquo;ve never liked that. If you don&amp;rsquo;t pay me out, you&amp;rsquo;re doing me a disservice. I&amp;rsquo;ve got so many flaws, and that&amp;rsquo;s just another part of me.&amp;rdquo; So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, that&amp;rsquo;s tangential, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel right without you having an idea of what she was like. Em had been dead for approaching 13 months when she first messaged me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 4, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/my-dead-girlfriend-keeps-messaging-me-on-facebook/Message-1.png&#34;  alt=&#34;The first message I got from &amp;lsquo;Emily&amp;rsquo;&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is when it began. I had left Emily&amp;rsquo;s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her pictures. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialize it. I &amp;lsquo;share&amp;rsquo; access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of three minutes on the account (or total on a computer). After a little confusion, I thought it was her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 6, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/my-dead-girlfriend-keeps-messaging-me-on-facebook/Message-2.png&#34;  alt=&#34;The second message I received.&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had received conformation from Susan that she hadn&amp;rsquo;t been on Em&amp;rsquo;s profile since the week of her death. Em knew a lot of people, so I thought it was one of her tech savvy friends fucking with me in the worst possible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/my-dead-girlfriend-keeps-messaging-me-on-facebook/The-Photos.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/my-dead-girlfriend-keeps-messaging-me-on-facebook/The-Photos.png&#34;  alt=&#34;The pictures &amp;lsquo;she&amp;rsquo; tagged herself in.&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around February 2014, Emily started tagging herself in my photos. I would get notifications for them, but they&amp;rsquo;d normally be removed by the time I got to the picture. The first time I actually caught one, it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. &amp;lsquo;She&amp;rsquo; would tag herself in spaces where it was plausible for her to be, or where she&amp;rsquo;d usually hang out. I&amp;rsquo;ve got screenshots of two (from April and June; these are the only ones I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to catch, so they&amp;rsquo;re a little out of the timeline I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, I began to lose sleep. I was too angry to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She would tag herself in random photos every couple of weeks. The friends who noticed it thought it was some fucked up bug; I found out recently that there have been friends who have noticed and didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about it. Some of them even removed me from their Facebook friends list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may be wondering &amp;lsquo;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you just kill your Facebook profile?&amp;rsquo; I almost wish I did. I did for a little while. On days when I can&amp;rsquo;t get out there, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have friends to chat with. It&amp;rsquo;s nice visiting Em&amp;rsquo;s page when the little green dot isn&amp;rsquo;t next to her name. I was already socially reclusive when Em was alive; her death turned me into something pretty close to a hermit, and Facebook and MMOs were (are) my only real social outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 15, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent what I assumed was Em&amp;rsquo;s hacker a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 25th, I got an &amp;lsquo;answer&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until a few months after going through these chats that I discovered that she was recycling my own words as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response seems kinda lackluster here. I was intentionally providing her/him with emotional &amp;lsquo;bait&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;This is actually devastating&amp;rsquo;) to keep them interested in their game; I was working off the assumption that the kind of person who would do this is the kind of person that thrives of off the distress of others. I was posting in tech forums, trying to find a way to find this person, contacting Facebook. I needed to keep them around to gather &amp;rsquo;evidence&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had even changed the password and security details several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 16, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 29, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t discovered any leads. Facebook had told me the locations her page had been accessed from, but since her death, they&amp;rsquo;re all places I can account for (my house, my work, her mum&amp;rsquo;s house, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response here wasn&amp;rsquo;t bait. &amp;ldquo;yo ask Nathan&amp;rdquo; was an inside joke that&amp;rsquo;s too lame worth explaining, but seeing &amp;lsquo;her&amp;rsquo; say it again was absolutely fucking crippling. My reaction in real life was much less prettier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her last few messages have started to scare me, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t admit until this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 8, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t even have words for this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;FRE EZIN G&amp;rsquo; is the first original word she&amp;rsquo;s(?) said. This has given me nightmares that just won&amp;rsquo;t end. I keep dreaming that she&amp;rsquo;s in an ice cold car, frozen, blue and grey. I&amp;rsquo;m standing outside the car door in the warmth screaming for her to come out. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t even realize I&amp;rsquo;m there. Sometimes her legs are outside with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 24, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really drunk. Em wasn&amp;rsquo;t an affectionate girl, and it always embarrassed her to exchange &amp;lsquo;I love you&amp;rsquo;s, cuddle, talk about how much we meant to each other. She was more comfortable with it when I was drunk. I pretended to be drunk a LOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her reply is what prompted me to finally memorialize her page, thinking it might put an end to this. It might seem innocuous to her previous message - it&amp;rsquo;s from an old conversation where I was trying to convince her to let me drive her home from a friend&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the collision, the dashboard crushed her. She was severed in a diagonal line from her right hip to midway down her left thigh. One of her legs was found tucked under the backseat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7, 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back in time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the messages I sent her the day she died. She was usually home by 4:30. This, alongside a couple voicemails, is the last time I talked to her under the assumption that she was still alive. You&amp;rsquo;ll see why I&amp;rsquo;m showing you these soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 1, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got these messages yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I memorialized her page a few days after the message about walking. Until today, she&amp;rsquo;d been quiet; she hadn&amp;rsquo;t even been tagging herself in my photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do anymore. Do I kill her profile? What if it is her? I feel like I wanna puke. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got a notification, I heard the alert sound. I&amp;rsquo;m just too afraid to swap windows and check it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the alert. I heard it as I was compiling all this together. This was the message..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s my door&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s my computer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the message three hours ago, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to check it until now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m legitimately scared. I have no idea who took this photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on my tablet in my garage. Zen for now. Going to drive to friend&amp;rsquo;s. Forgot to open the garage door in my panic so building up the nerve to get out to do that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved horrifying images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictures that could make one feel uneasy or even utterly terrified fascinated and delighted me. Yet for all of my appreciation and exposure, they worked their charms exceptionally well on me. I had trouble falling asleep most nights with the visions of these nightmarish things invading my mind and leaving it a smoldering wreck. From horror games to Internet screamers to the illustrations of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, I had a host of things in my head to keep me up at night. I was enthralled and terrified by nearly all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exceptions were the images I&amp;rsquo;d created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the March of my junior year in high school. I loved working with the copy of Photoshop installed on our school-issued laptops, and I made photo manipulations relatively often. The only thing they had in common was a complete lack of terror. One day, I set out to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d wanted for a long time to test my ability to frighten with imagery. I had already established a reputation as a teller of terrible tales; if anyone ever wanted a good scare, they knew to seek me out. As happy as I was with spreading scary stories, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t content with stopping there. I wished to expand my horizons as a fright-man. I found a song on my iPod that I&amp;rsquo;d acquired on a whim months prior, set it to loop, and searched Google for the perfect picture to make my monster. I found it in an image of George Marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar to me; but the picture, with George&amp;rsquo;s gaping smile and his wide eyes, was exactly what I&amp;rsquo;d been searching before. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long, perhaps forty minutes at the most. I stretched out his mouth, covered his eyes, and put a filter over it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A habit began to form. Like a drug, I became addicted to creating these abominations in Photoshop. I relished the horror of the images I&amp;rsquo;d made; I showed them around and received similar, aghast reactions from every last soul to gaze upon them. I relished the ease of which I could make the pictures. Most of all, I relished my absence of fear. I simply had to make more. One image every few months grew to one or two every month. From there, I began making one every week. Before I knew it, I was making one of these images almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time wore on, I began referring to these images as my children. I had a folder filled with dozens of my children named MIRTH. I loved them dearly. They were macabre, Hellish, and all mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was barely twenty. I&amp;rsquo;d left the house and set out from my hometown to live in a larger city a few dozen miles away. I was in school, I had a few good friends, and life was pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only exceptions were the images I&amp;rsquo;d created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My infatuation with them began to grow to unsettling heights. Not only did I need to create more of my children, I felt a need to be around them. There was a burning emptiness I felt when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in their presence. I heard faint, incessant whispers in my head while I was away from them. I had to quench this miserable emptiness. The whispers needed to cease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I printed out several of my children and hung them up in my room, pox of a terrible disease on an otherwise average room. I made more, cut them out and made casings for my personal affects: my iPod, my wallet, even my laptop was covered with them. For a small price, I would do the same for others&amp;rsquo; devices. They became somewhat popular around my university. They thought nothing of my eagerness to perform this service. The consensus was that I was attempting to make a name for myself, and since I was quite skilled at designing and applying these cases, they also liked the appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t remember when I began muttering. My children had crept further into the recesses of my mind and spoke with my voice. I would ask empty rooms why they weren&amp;rsquo;t laughing. I would ask for the people around me to laugh. Sometimes these mutterings would escalate further, leading me to speak or even scream these messages of mirth. Thankfully, I only muttered when I was out and about. People knew I&amp;rsquo;d talked to myself for years; For as long as I (or anyone else) could remember, I muttered and spoke quotes and conversations from movies, television shows, and games. At that point, no one ever bothered to listen to what I was saying. The screaming only occurred on two occasions. One went without incident in the middle of the day while everyone else was at work or running errands. One earned me a noise complaint, but I explained to the landlord that I&amp;rsquo;d had a nightmare. The apartment walls were thick, and all they heard was the noise, no words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one unfortunate incident, however. Several of my friends came to my apartment one night to socialize and make merry. We were all having a great time, clanking glasses, having quiet or loud conversations, spilling drinks, tearing through levels of cartridge-era video games, the sort of thing my friends and I customarily did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was two-thirty in the morning. The celebration had died down, and a few of my friends were passed out on my couch or in corners of the room. I had none of my children around me, yet I felt at ease. Kevin, one of my friends and the only one who hadn&amp;rsquo;t been drinking, was on the Super Nintendo. He&amp;rsquo;d finished destroying a town he built on SimCity, and decided to play Yoshi&amp;rsquo;s Island. As he played, I began to fade in and out of consciousness; I was rather intoxicated, and the night was aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he got to the first of the Piranha Plants, however, I was slightly stirred. Its gaping mouth and its eyeless head reminded me of George. George was waiting for me, as were all of my other children. A single whisper passed my ear before Kevin destroyed the plant. Still, as they entered the screen, my head swam more and more with thoughts of my children. I could hear them in my head, begging me to return to them. I was able to keep them at bay for almost an hour before the mumbling began again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blacked out after they started. When I awoke, all of my friends were still in the apartment. I was in my room. They were all on my bed, looking at me. The children that were on the walls were torn down and heaped in an ugly pile in a corner of the room. Kevin had a bruise on his neck. I asked what the hell happened, and Kevin explained everything. We had been the only ones awake, and he could understand every word I was saying while I was muttering. He was concerned, but assumed I was talking in my sleep; I was out of his peripheral vision, and he was focused on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I began to vocalize my wishes of laughter, he put the game on pause to stare at me. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be silenced, in spite of his requests to cease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Laugh,&amp;rdquo; I begged him. &amp;ldquo;Why aren&amp;rsquo;t you laughing, child?&amp;rdquo; After a moment of silence, I grabbed him by his throat, and at the top of my lungs I demanded he laugh. Being stronger than me, he broke free of my grip and restrained me. I shook and thrashed in the chair for twenty minutes before blacking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends were indeed concerned. They asked if I remembered what I was talking about. I told them about my children. I told them about our mutual need of one another. Of course, they issued forth more concern. While I was restrained, they turned on my computer. They demanded my login information for it, and I begrudgingly divulged, knowing exactly what they were about to do. They recoiled from my screen as they were greeted by George, who was now my desktop background. They quickly reset George and had him replaced by the default background. I watched as they deleted MIRTH, first sending it into the Recycle Bin and deleting it permanently from the green hills and blue sky that was my background. I feigned tears, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t truly concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they had finished destroying my children, they begged me to see a psychiatrist. They said if there was another outburst similar to the previous night, they&amp;rsquo;d see me into a mental hospital. On that note, they freed me from my bonds and bade me farewell before leaving. Upholding my friends&amp;rsquo; wishes, I looked up a local psychiatrist&amp;rsquo;s office and set up an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never felt at rest in a psychiatrist&amp;rsquo;s office. I was used to being the quiet, observant one, and a psychiatrist is quiet and observant for a living. If nothing else I felt like my mind was being invaded when they would ask me questions. Between the threat on my identity and the feeling of intrusion, I endlessly debated with myself on whether or not to show up to my appointment. Half an hour before the appointment was scheduled, my sense of duty won out. I climbed into my car and made my way to the psych.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the psychiatrist&amp;rsquo;s office, I sat in the reclined chair. Dr. Ridley (or Pauline, if I so desired) began our arduous session by asking me about any previous incidents. I could remember only one. In eighth grade I was tormented by visions of a small girl in a pink dress. Her straw-like hair dangled in front of her face, and the bits of flesh that clung to her face were completely absent about her mouth. She would chase me, her exposed teeth chomping at me ceaselessly as I ran myself down and collapsed. She would laugh and stab me to death with a large, bloody kitchen knife. I simply would not die; it always took dozens of stabs to finish me off. Her laughter was terrible. I went to counseling, and after a short time the visions stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making some scribbles on her clipboard, she smiled and calmly asked me to explain everything about what was going on in my head now. I weaved for her the riveting yarn about my ordeal with my children, and she did exactly as I&amp;rsquo;d expected; she sat, nodded, scribbled something down on her clipboard, studied my face, scribbled, nodded, and studied all the way through my story in a methodical and agonizingly monotonous way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost hoped she&amp;rsquo;d stop me in the middle of my story and ask other questions, offer explanations, hell, give me a hug, something! She said that she would research what I&amp;rsquo;ve told her and cross-reference any existing previous cases to determine a course of treatment. Almost pleasantly surprised, I smiled and nodded, thanked her, got the hell out of that clinic, and drove home. However close to being pleasantly surprised I was, I was still bitterly disappointed. I knew I had a problem, and I almost wished she had a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still in love with my children. I sorted out the pile of them on the floor and taped them up again. Their blank eyes and their big smiles made me feel so welcome. I opened my computer to be greeted by the hills again. I smiled and produced a small USB drive from my desk drawer. I plugged it in to my computer and opened it. There it was: MIRTH. I would never trust my computer to hold all of my children! What if it crashed? I would have lost them! The folder they deleted had only a fraction of the children I had in this folder. I opened up the folder and felt oh, so at ease. As I flipped through the dozens of horrors I&amp;rsquo;d made, I felt more at home than I ever had anytime else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet tonight, something felt wrong. Perhaps it was my acknowledgement of my obsession that began warping my view. Their smiles seemed colder, their black-and-white faces glowed unnaturally and their blank eyes stared into me somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began feeling uneasy as I made my way through the folder. Every so often, my eyes picked up on text that would appear in the middle of the photos. The one phrase that kept repeating was, &amp;ldquo;WHY FATHER.&amp;rdquo; The more I scrolled and browsed my children, the more my blood began to chill and my skin began to crawl. Other text began to appear: &amp;ldquo;WE LOVED YOU,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;WE TRUSTED YOU,&amp;rdquo; and, &amp;ldquo;FATHER LOVE US,&amp;rdquo; popped up with increasing frequency. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I kept scrolling. I felt like I was tumbling down a spiral staircase and I could only stop when I–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I reached the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last photo was of me. It was amazing: it was in full color, my eyes were sewn shut, and my jaw stretched far below my neck. My lips were peeled back in mirth to expose long, discolored teeth. It was beautiful, brilliantly executed, and it made me scream. I didn&amp;rsquo;t make this. I didn&amp;rsquo;t–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what actually happened after that. The line between reality and delusion blurred. My mind completely derailed. The photo on the screen twisted and contorted at grotesque angles and in inhuman fashions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Love us again!!&amp;rdquo; it shouted in a tremulous, inhuman voice. I fell out of my chair, wailing. I landed on my back and stared up at my walls, from where all of my children stared down and laughed. In unison, they all began to chant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We do not love you anymore, Father!! Why aren&amp;rsquo;t you laughing?!!!&amp;rdquo; they bellowed. They laughed and screamed and their blank eyes ripped open to drip blood onto my face. Their faces drew closer and closer to mine. I knew it had to be a psychotic delusion but was it? How could I be so sure? The first of my children took to the front of the horde, and its gaping maw enveloped my head. My screams were muffled by the void, my vision went black&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I woke up on my bed. There were no screams now, only whispers. I could still hear my children whispering to me. Their voices slipped into my ears ever so gently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t love you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You should be laughing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Laugh, Father.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed. I laughed for what felt like hours until I passed out from exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life since has been uneventful. I eventually found work in a small graphic design firm, and my life has been quiet. Still, some nights, I hear my children calling to me from the darkness of my room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Laugh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Channel ∞</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a legend circulating around the television industry about Channel ∞.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel ∞ is hard to get to, and reports vary as to what it actually is. I will tell you how to get there and then what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquire a television, preferably analogue for the best experience, and the older the better. Acquire a remote control. It does not have to go with the television you&amp;rsquo;re using. Turn on the TV and set it to a channel that is static, or just a plain black screen if you are using a digital TV. Basically any channel you do not receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave the room for about three hours. If you have a significant other in the house, have them with you. It is also best to call over a few friends. During those three hours, you should acquire a few items. I will list them in order from the most important to the least. Note that none of these are mandatory, but they help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An item that you hold dear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two handheld mirrors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A firearm or other weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A favorite book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mobile communications device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sledgehammer or pickaxe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After roughly three hours have passed, re-enter the room. Have everyone else wait outside the door and close it. Stare at the static or blank screen or whatever you set the TV to until you feel disoriented or freaked out, then call the others into the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give the item that you hold dear to the person that you care about the most in the room, then instruct them to leave. If you did not grab an item that you hold dear, hug that person and whisper a secret in their ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send them back out and command them to not come back in no matter what until you open the door again. This will be harder for them if there are more people, but it will be safer for you. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold the mirrors so that one is reflecting the television screen into the other and the second is reflecting you, so it looks as if the television is behind you. Stay like this until a question appears on the screen. If you did not grab the mirrors, then sit in a chair facing away from the TV until you hear a noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab the remote. There will be a question on the screen. Press channel up to answer yes, channel down to answer no. There will be anywhere from three to 26 questions, if reports are to be trusted. The questions will be anywhere from trivial to deep philosophic personal questions. Answer truthfully, or you will not succeed in reaching Channel ∞.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the questions, one of three things will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your favorite show of all time will come on, but in the episode, all of the characters will be heart-wrenchingly killed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will see a picture of your least favorite person or thing ever. This is where you use the firearm or other weapon. Break the TV screen with the weapon. It will then fix itself. This is obviously the easiest of the three things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strange shimmery vortex will surround you, and you will be pulled into an alternate dimension. If you find yourself here, here&amp;rsquo;s what to do: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be in a twisted replica of your house. Go to your room, where you will find the four items listed that you will need for this part. Take them. Exit your house. Outside will be a more evil-looking version of our world, with a red sky, grey sun, dark orange plants, and an ever-present thin vermilion mist. You must go to the nearest public building (i.e. a school, mall, gas station, etc.). Use the key on the door and enter. It will fit the lock. If you did not get a key, climb in through a window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon entering, find a room with only one entrance. Sit down and begin reading the book. If you did not get a book, just sit down and be bored/scared. You will hear footsteps outside of the door some time within the next hour. Don’t look up from the book. After you can no longer hear the footsteps, count to 250 out loud. Every 10 numbers, you will hear another footstep closer and closer to the door. Upon reaching 250, you will hear a knock on the door. If there are three knocks, open the door. If there are four, say “I forbid you,” twice, and then open the door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see a stone statue of someone you love deeply outside of the door. It could be a family member, best friend, romantic partner, or even a fictional character. Smash its head to bits with the sledgehammer or pickaxe. If it is a female, also destroy the left hand. If you did not get the hammer or pick, push the statue over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exit the building from the entrance you came in through. It will be night. Look at the moon. It will be either pink or green, and either full or half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink and half: pull out the phone and call your third most recent contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink and full: pull out the phone and dial a random number. Before they pick up, bite through your tongue. If you did not get the device, pretend to do the things above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green and half: strip off all your clothing and sprint back to your house. Don’t look behind you no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green and full: to put it bluntly, you’re screwed. You’ll be dead within half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is one of the first three, you will wake up in front of the television and you can continue the ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, you will have reached Channel ∞. What you do now is up to you. If you go to the guide function, you will see shows listed such as &amp;ldquo;The Meaning of Life&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;How to Acquire True Love&amp;rdquo;. Choose one. The amount of people you have outside the door with you determines the revelations in the shows. The more people, the better chance you have of seeing shows with life-changing results. Or, if you keep watching the static, without going to the guide or breaking eye contact with the television, you will see a series of images that will, if deciphered, reveal the answer to your greatest question. There are, at this point, many options, too many to write here. Just do what you feel like you must, and something will happen. The overwhelming majority of things will be good, but some will be bad. You may leave the room at any point. However, there are two catches. You may never speak of what you learned after accessing Channel ∞, and you may only reach Channel ∞ four times in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you find the experience enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Happy Sun Daycare</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/happy-sun-daycare/ingen-lek.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/happy-sun-daycare/ingen-lek.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Ingen Lek&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few miles outside of my town stood an old country house. It had been converted into a daycare, where parents would drop off their kids in the morning and pick them up in the evening. However, said daycare had been out of business for a few years now. There was a sign posted in the front yard just a few feet from the house that read &amp;ldquo;Happy Sun Daycare&amp;rdquo;, with a cute-looking cartoony sun painted on it. Within the fenced-off backyard stood playground equipment that had fallen into disrepair and began to rust. A slide, a couple of swing-sets, some monkey-bars, and a merry-go-round were once covered by swarms of children as they ran and played in the outdoors. They had since become perches for the local birds and squirrels, and were swarmed by ants rather than children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had decided to write a report on the Happy Sun Daycare for the news blog I worked for. For one thing, several people around today had gone to that daycare. I figured it might make for an interesting story to read about their experiences there and if it affected their later life in any way. The other reason wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite so innocent. There had always been concerned parents who would fret over leaving their child in someone else&amp;rsquo;s care. It was about that constant worry over how safe their sons and daughters were, especially with all the horror stories posted online about various daycare-related tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my report, I decided I would interview both employees and people who had gone to the daycare as children. I wanted to get as many different points of view as possible so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t seem too terribly biased. Of course, I agreed to not use real names, for the sake of their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person I interviewed was a middle-aged woman who looked after the infants at the daycare. For the sake of her privacy, we&amp;rsquo;ll just call her &amp;ldquo;Margaret&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What was it like working at the daycare?&amp;rdquo; I asked her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She replied, &amp;ldquo;Oh, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything too spectacular. Just your typical day of working with children, or babies in my case.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I see,&amp;rdquo; I said before I asked, &amp;ldquo;have you had any problems while working there?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret shook her head, &amp;ldquo;With the babies? Of course not. They could be fussy, but they weren&amp;rsquo;t any trouble at all. The children were another story.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piqued my interest. Were the children that attended Happy Sun Daycare too much for the employees to handle? Or, could it be that there were cases of abuse going on that had been kept secret until now? I had to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why might that be?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; Margaret paused for a second, as though she was apprehensive about speaking to me, &amp;ldquo;there were times when I heard muffled squealing. No, not squealing. Screaming. At first, I thought it was just the children pretending to be scared. But the more I heard it, the more I realized those screams were real. That something was terrifying or possibly even hurting them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did you ever see any children get hurt?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret nodded, &amp;ldquo;Yes. Most of them were just the usual scrapes and bruises you&amp;rsquo;d expect to find on a child who fell while playing or bumped his head trying to show off to his or her friends. Some of them, though, seemed off to me. Every so often I would see a child walk past on the way to the nurse&amp;rsquo;s office. And each time, the child looked like he had been scratched or even bitten.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children scratched or bitten? That would be cause for alarm for anyone. Perhaps some wild animal had decided to make its home near the daycare and curious children had gotten too close. Maybe a stray dog had wandered into the playground and some poor unknowing kid wanted to pet it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Were there any animals in the area?&amp;rdquo; I decided to ask, &amp;ldquo;Stray dogs? Raccoons? Perhaps a possum nest?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I doubt it. Pets weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed at the daycare, and traps were set up at night to keep any wildlife away. There might&amp;rsquo;ve been a dog roaming around the area.&amp;rdquo; Margaret shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pointed out, &amp;ldquo;Perhaps it was the dog that had bitten those children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, I only heard the dog.&amp;rdquo; she told me, &amp;ldquo;I had never actually seen it. All I&amp;rsquo;d ever experienced was the occasional growl, snarl, or howl.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Margaret had only heard what sounded like a dog. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t rule out the possibility that perhaps she had mistaken some noise she&amp;rsquo;d heard for that of a dog. Maybe she&amp;rsquo;d heard some children that were only pretending to be dogs and mistook them for a real one. Maybe she&amp;rsquo;d heard the wind and thought it was a howl. If that were the case, it would explain the scratches and bites she&amp;rsquo;d seen on some of the children. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too out of the realm of possibility that a child could&amp;rsquo;ve simply scratched their arm on a branch or part of the fence by accident. With what sounded like a dog&amp;rsquo;s growl to her, Margaret could&amp;rsquo;ve reached the conclusion that the children were being attacked by some sort of stray canine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I had to learn more about the daycare. With the possibility of a cover-up regarding a series of dog attacks, I figured the next person to interview would be a former attendee. Perhaps one of them would have childhood memories that could potentially shed some light on what Margaret had mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some background checks, I managed to find a young man who went to Happy Sun Daycare when he was around five or six. Let&amp;rsquo;s just call him &amp;ldquo;Scott&amp;rdquo;. I found Scott working at a local butcher&amp;rsquo;s shop. I had to wait until his shift was over before I could start the interview. Luckily, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too long of a wait, and it gave me some time to consider what to ask him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do you remember anything about Happy Sun Daycare?&amp;rdquo; I asked, &amp;ldquo;I know it was a long time ago. But perhaps you can recall something?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott thought for a moment before replying, &amp;ldquo;Not much. I was only five, maybe six, when I went. I can remember just doin&amp;rsquo; what kids do at that age. Playing, finger-painting, watching cartoons. That kind of stuff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nodded, &amp;ldquo;Were you a good kid?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the most part.&amp;rdquo; he admitted, &amp;ldquo;Occasionally I&amp;rsquo;d get into some trouble. Nothing too serious, though. Just your typical kid fussiness. Ya know, not wanting to take naps, refusing to eat veggies, that sort of thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I see.&amp;rdquo; I replied as I wrote down what he told me in a notepad, &amp;ldquo;And was the daycare fair in how they disciplined you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eh, somewhat. All I ever got was a scolding and the occasional &amp;rsquo;time out&amp;rsquo;. They made you sit in a corner for a few minutes until they felt you were ready to join the other kids. Though, you were lucky if that was all you got.&amp;rdquo; Scott pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Scott said baffled me a bit. They were lucky? How? I began to wonder if perhaps there had been more severe punishments for the more unruly children that attended the daycare. Could there have been some sort of more controversial form of discipline that the employees at Happy Sun Daycare used that they didn&amp;rsquo;t want known to the public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to know, &amp;ldquo;What exactly do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief moment, Scott gave a shudder. He seemed to have recalled something from his childhood that potentially frightened him and affected his adulthood as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The kids who got into real trouble were sent into &amp;lsquo;The Gray Door&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; Scott heaved a heavy sigh, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been in there myself. I knew a few kids that had. Ones that would get into fights or throw huge tantrums. They&amp;rsquo;d end up going into that room. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what happened in there. But they&amp;rsquo;d always come out shaking, with wide eyes. A few would break down crying, some would scream; one kid even threw up before passing out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frowned slightly. What sort of horrors had been conducted in the room that had been nicknamed &amp;ldquo;The Gray Door&amp;rdquo;? I then remembered what Margaret had told me and decided to check for a connection with her story and Scott&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did the children have any scratches or bites on them?&amp;rdquo; I asked, &amp;ldquo;And did you hear any strange noises?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He nodded, &amp;ldquo;A few kids had scratches on them after they left the Gray Door. But I thought they got them before, and I just didn&amp;rsquo;t notice them at first. They could&amp;rsquo;ve tripped or something. I did hear some heavy breathing. That could&amp;rsquo;ve just been some kid panting from running around. Hard to say for sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Margaret said she thought she heard a dog snarling, and now Scott was saying he had heard heavy breathing. With the strange noises, mysterious scratches on misbehaving children, and the mystery of the Gray Door room, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder what it was that Happy Sun Daycare had been hiding all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thanked Scott for taking the time to speak to me before moving onto the next person to interview. With my curiosity regarding the Gray Door still heightened, I figured the next person to speak to should be one of the more trouble-making attendees of the daycare. I had to know more about what went on inside that room, and perhaps one of them could tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing more background checks, I managed to track down a young woman whom we&amp;rsquo;ll refer to as &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;rdquo;. She had been arrested two weeks ago for spraying graffiti, and was charged with vandalism. Rather than spend time in jail, she agreed to do four months of community service. From what I read about her records, it seemed this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time she had gotten in trouble with the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Were you always this much trouble?&amp;rdquo; I asked her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice shrugged, &amp;ldquo;Maybe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how easy it would be to get the answers I wanted from her. She seemed like the type who would only cooperate if she&amp;rsquo;d get something out of it, like less time behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I need to know about Happy Sun Daycare.&amp;rdquo; I asked her, &amp;ldquo;Do you remember anything about the Gray Door?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief second, a hint of fear flashed in her eyes. Her face became pale as a few beads of sweat trickled down her forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Th-that was a long time ago.&amp;rdquo; Alice pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied, &amp;ldquo;Surely you must remember something? Records show you were ten when you attended. Are you sure you can&amp;rsquo;t recall anything?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice took a few deep breaths and began to regain her composure. If the mere mention of the Gray Door room was enough to put fear into her after all those years, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but dread what horrors she could&amp;rsquo;ve experienced. Here was someone who had run-ins with the law. Someone who had been arrested for various crimes, primarily theft, vandalism, and trespassing. And, yet, it was something from her childhood that caused the most fear of being punished. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you. But you gotta promise never to say that I told you anything. Got it?&amp;rdquo; Alice sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reassured her, &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t reveal any names. That will be strictly confidential.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You see, I was playing outside in the playground.&amp;rdquo; she began to explain, &amp;ldquo;I remember wanting to play on the swings. Another kid claimed he had already gotten first dibs to play on them. Before I knew it, we were having a big argument. I lost control. Next thing I knew, he was on the ground crying. I must&amp;rsquo;ve pushed him when we were arguing. One of the teachers came up and grabbed me by the arm and dragged me inside. She told me that I would be taken into what the other kids called the Gray Door room as punishment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What was inside the room?&amp;rdquo; I asked in anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice took another deep breath and let out a shudder and a sigh, &amp;ldquo;The room was mostly empty. I remember the floor was nothing but dirt ground, and the only light was a dingy old bulb that barely lit anything up. The teacher just shoved me in and slammed the door shut. At first, I tried pounding on the door and screaming. I cried out for anyone to open it. It was so dark and cold, and I was so scared. And I-I heard something. Something was behind me. I turned around, and I remember screaming louder than I had ever screamed in my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frowned in concern, &amp;ldquo;What did you see?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was a dog. Or, at least, I think it was a dog.&amp;rdquo; she choked back a few tears, &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a good look at it since it was so dark. All I remember was that it was the biggest and ugliest dog I had ever seen. That thing had glowing yellow eyes, huge sharp teeth, and was covered in black shaggy fur. And, before I knew it, it snarled and lunged at me. I ran around as fast as I could, screaming and begging for anyone to come and save me. It grabbed onto my skirt with its teeth and tried to pull me towards it. I tripped and fell, but I managed to kick it in the face a couple of times to get it to let go. Then it lunged at me again. But luckily for me, the door finally opened, and one of the teachers pulled me out of the room and slammed the door shut before the dog could get me again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there was a dog after all. The stories were all starting to come together. Margaret&amp;rsquo;s story about hearing screams and growling. Scott&amp;rsquo;s story about horrified kids who had been sent to the Gray Door room. And now, there was Alice&amp;rsquo;s story about being sent to that room and attacked by some sort of large vicious dog. Still, I had to know more. Why did they use a dog? Why did they cover it up? Perhaps the people working at Happy Sun Daycare were afraid that such a punishment would be too extreme to use on children. Or maybe they feared being sued by some animal rights group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thanked Alice for her time and set forth to find the next person to talk to. Maybe it would be another one of the employees. If I was lucky, I might be able to get one of them to reveal the truth about what was going on in the Gray Door room. Once again, I began searching through the records of anyone who ever worked at Happy Sun Daycare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took some time to find someone who was willing to talk to me. Most former employees I asked were either too busy or simply didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give an interview. A few of them directed various profanities at me as well. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell if they were angry that I had learned about what was going on all those years ago, or if they were afraid of what might happen if they revealed any more secrets to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I managed to track down at least one person who was willing to tell me his experiences working at Happy Sun Daycare. &amp;ldquo;Mr. Smith&amp;rdquo;, as we&amp;rsquo;ll call him, worked as a janitor at the daycare back when it was still running. He had managed to get the job only because his aunt was in charge of one of the head offices there as well. However, Mr. Smith had moved to another town since the daycare closed years ago. This meant I couldn&amp;rsquo;t interview him in person, so we sent each other e-mails instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Smith explained that he had been dealing some form of Narcolepsy since he was a teenager, and a history of sleepwalking as well. Doctors couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what was causing his condition, but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any other adverse health effects linked to it, either. This still made it difficult for him to find work, though. He told me that he was grateful that his aunt managed to get him a job at Happy Sun Daycare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had so many questions. And, well, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure which one to ask first. After I got his first response, I wrote back to him. I wanted to know how he was able to hold his job despite his condition. Was he on medication for it? How did the other employees and the children treat him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days passed before I got any response from him. I quickly opened the latest e-mail response from Mr. Smith and began to read. He replied that his aunt would mix him a special herbal tea for him that would help keep his Narcolepsy in check. She apparently strongly believed in herbal medicine and said that it was the better than any standard medicine on the market. Mr. Smith wrote about how the tea was quite bitter and how he hated drinking it, but that he had to drink it if he wanted to keep his job. Though, on occasion, his aunt would run out of the leaves needed for the tea and he&amp;rsquo;d end up falling asleep. This prompted another employee to go and make sure he didn&amp;rsquo;t accidentally hurt himself or others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;float-right&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/happy-sun-daycare/happysunwerewolf.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Happysunwerewolf&#34;   title=&#34;The alleged &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34; that attacked various children at Happy Sun Daycare.&#34;  loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The alleged &amp;ldquo;dog&amp;rdquo; that attacked various children at Happy Sun Daycare.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for how others treated him, Mr. Smith explained in his letter that the children were generally very nice to him. Most of them were quite curious and would ask him a lot of questions while he worked. A few would act as a nuisance, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t recall any of them being too much trouble. On the other hand, the other employees seemed to have a sense of uneasiness around him. He explained how he felt that they seemed extremely cautious around him. Also, he pointed out that his aunt always kept a close eye on him. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if this was due to his condition or for some other reason, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That just caused more questions to form in my mind. Why were the other employees uneasy around him? Was it because he was the nephew of one of the higher-ups? Or was there another reason? And there was the matter of his aunt keeping a close eye on him. Maybe they were trying to keep the whole issue regarding the Gray Door room a secret from him. Perhaps they were afraid that he would find out about the dog and would contact the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to know if he knew anything about the room. I quickly wrote a reply and asked if he knew anything about a large, empty room and children being attacked by some sort of dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another couple days passed before I got another response from Mr. Smith. I opened the reply and began to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that he didn&amp;rsquo;t remember any kind of dog at the daycare. In fact, he pointed out that animals weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed on the property and that he would set traps to keep the squirrels and mice out. His aunt was very strict about no pets being allowed as well. Most likely, it was due to any potential allergies kids might have. Mr. Smith explained in his reply that perhaps the dog that Alice claimed had attacked her was just someone in a cheap-looking dog costume, that the room had perhaps been kept barely lit so the kids in there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t realize it was fake, and that the scratches and bites were just the result of them tripping and accidentally scratching themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, he had been in the Gray Door room himself several times as well. Strangely, he pointed out that it was always when he hadn&amp;rsquo;t any tea to drink. He would wake up in the room. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if anyone had moved him there so he could sleep without being in anyone&amp;rsquo;s way, or if he had been sleepwalking again and just stumbled in there by mistake. Mr. Smith explained that the room was originally going to be a large storage closet for various arts-and-crafts related supplies, but was never finished due to budget cuts. He wrote in his reply that his aunt didn&amp;rsquo;t want the area to go to waste, so they decided to use it as a means to punish misbehaving children. In his opinion, someone probably bought a dog costume and would wear it while terrorizing any children sent into the room, as a means of instilling the fear of punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent one last e-mail to Mr. Smith thanking him for taking the time to reply to my messages. The whole thing about Happy Sun Daycare was starting to come together. From what I had gathered via the various interviews from both students and employees, children who misbehaved were sent to a large empty space called the &amp;ldquo;Gray Door&amp;rdquo; room. There was a dog, or possibly just someone in a dog costume, that would chase any child sent in there. Finally, said child would be pulled to safety before the dog could cause any serious harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was only one thing left to do. I was going to head inside Happy Sun Daycare and investigate the infamous Gray Door room for myself. I had to see for myself if there was anything that could solve this strange cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several minutes passed as I drove out into the countryside and towards the abandoned building. I parked the car in the front driveway and took a few deep breaths. The front door was unlocked, which was lucky for me. I gently pushed it open and began to look inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interior was dingy and covered in a layer of dust. Cobwebs spread over various desks and chairs that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been used in quite some time. A musty smell filled the house and mixed with the odor of feces and urine from the rats that now made the place their home. It was nauseating, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I explored several different areas, I soon found the foreboding gray door that was said to lead to the dreaded room. The door was quite heavy, and it took me several tries before I managed to force it open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like how Alice had described, the room was dark and empty, with a dirt floor and a dingy bulb. Said bulb had burned out long ago, so I used an old desk to prop the door open in order to see anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see faint bloodstains on the ground and on the wall, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell who or what the blood belonged to. There were strange markings on the wall, as well. I took a closer look and could&amp;rsquo;ve sworn they resembled claw marks of some sort. As I continued to examine the room, I noticed various footprints in the dirt. Many were faded, or had been trampled over one another. But I could still make out a few. Most of them were the footprints of children. They looked like their makers had been running away from something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one other distinct set of footprints that caught my attention. I examined them closely. I could definitely make out the distinctive foot pads, claws, and individual toes on at least one of the prints. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t some person in a cheap costume. Happy Sun Daycare had been using a dog to terrorize children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to let people know what they had been hiding for all those years. However, as I made my way out the daycare and to my car, there was one aspect about those footprints that made me uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since when do dogs walk on two legs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d never been too fond of anyone at my local school. They were all a little rude and boring for me. You see, I grew up in a small area with not many people interested in art like I am, so I had to venture off from home. I found myself attending a pretty rural art college. It&amp;rsquo;s sorta like a normal university, except it&amp;rsquo;s full of big-headed people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason I&amp;rsquo;m here is because I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to be an illustrator, a kid&amp;rsquo;s book designer of sorts. I&amp;rsquo;d had a keen interest in children&amp;rsquo;s media and classic books such as the &lt;em&gt;Arthur&lt;/em&gt; series, so when I was sent to live at this college, I was taken aback when I realised a lot of the other students here were all &amp;ldquo;fine artists&amp;rdquo;. You know the kind; the ones who like to splatter paint onto a canvas and claim it&amp;rsquo;s art. I&amp;rsquo;m not really big on that sorta thing, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t question it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I settled into the new place pretty quickly. I was sharing a dorm with a few other students. There was myself, a graphic designer named Josh, a director and animator called Lilly, and one more guy called Daniel. Daniel was one of those &amp;ldquo;fine artists&amp;rdquo; I just described to you. His room was decorated with photographs of distorted women, and he always had weird music playing, too. It was sorta like trippy 60s stuff. He also liked to smoke, so his room smelt like an old ashtray. It was pretty gross, but he was a nice enough guy, and we all got along well. We soon became a tightly-packed group of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the start of a new term for us, having all came back from home after spending the summer there. We unpacked our things and began talking about what we&amp;rsquo;d done over the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I went hiking with my stepdad. We did one of those summer camps,&amp;rdquo; said Josh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I spent most of my time with my girlfriend. We watched films and went to see some plays, too,&amp;rdquo; Lilly said. She did a lot of whining about missing her sporty partner, so we were happy they&amp;rsquo;d had some time together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really done much worth mentioning. Just the usual stuff; parties and trips with my family. Nothing that special. I was just about to pipe up and speak when I got interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was at the dentist,&amp;rdquo; we heard Daniel say. &amp;ldquo;My father is a doctor of sorts, so he let me come with him and explore the hospital. My favourite place was the dentistry. I got to touch and feel teeth. It was cool.&amp;rdquo; We all stared at him, a bit confused. Were you allowed to have random strangers go into hospital rooms? Let alone play with the equipment? We didn&amp;rsquo;t really care. We knew Daniel was that sort of guy anyway. He was known for getting into trouble for &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;the sake of art.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; That was always his excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all spent our first couple of days getting to grips with our assignments, finding out what we had to do. Naturally, my task was to study some illustrators and mimic their styles. Josh spent some money on a new Mac for design tests, and Lilly had to start playing about with claymation. It was a pretty nice vibe when we we were all at at our dorms, talking and swapping ideas. At least, it was nice until Daniel started insulting us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;d never been the same since he came back from summer break. He seemed more cold and distant. He never told us anything about his projects, not even what the subject was. It was pretty normal for him to be reserved, but never this much. At nights, he&amp;rsquo;d make himself dinner, shut himself in his room, crank up the music, and not be seen until the next morning. The rest of us would go out places, like bowling or down to a local gig. Daniel used to happily tag along, but not anymore. We assumed that something must have happened to him, so we decided not to press him on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, myself and Josh had gone out. Lilly didn&amp;rsquo;t come with us; she said she wanted to see if Daniel was okay, since he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been talking to us for a few days now. We could see her point and complied. She spent the evening knocking on his door, trying to get him to speak with her. Just before we left, we saw it open and Lilly step inside before it was locked again. Brushing it off, we headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d gone to see a movie and then for a few innocent drinks. It was fun, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t get home &amp;rsquo;til around 2:00am. When we arrived back, Josh said goodnight and went straight to sleep. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to bed yet; I was pretty damn hungry. Drinking always made me hungry, so I raided our fridge and found some cold pizza from the night before. I was going to go back to my room when I realised something I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice before. Daniel wasn&amp;rsquo;t in his room, and Lilly wasn&amp;rsquo;t in hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to Daniel&amp;rsquo;s strange new behaviour of locking himself in his room until early hours, and the fact that Lilly never went anywhere without texting us, this was pretty weird. I went over to his door and gave it a knock, and it opened right up. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t locked or anything. I assumed he and her had gone out with some of his poncy art friends, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like Daniel to leave his door open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a nosy son of a bitch, so I stepped inside to see if there were any signs that he had gone somewhere. His keys and jacket were missing, but he&amp;rsquo;d left his wallet on his desk. The other thing that was odd was that his laptop was on his bed, and still on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity got the better of me. Perhaps this could&amp;rsquo;ve been my chance to find out about the art project he&amp;rsquo;d been hiding. I mean, Daniel was a &amp;ldquo;fine artist&amp;rdquo;, remember, so it could have been anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that he had a USB plugged in and two files on the screen. One was called &amp;ldquo;Dentist Photos&amp;rdquo; and the other file was a singular image named: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;teeth.jpg&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clicked on the &amp;ldquo;Dentist Photos&amp;rdquo; file. It was just pictures of people&amp;rsquo;s teeth, as well as plastic models of teeth. Nothing interesting. I clicked back off the file and decided to check out &amp;ldquo;teeth.jpg&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/teeth-jpg/teeth.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/teeth-jpg/teeth.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;teeth.jpg&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The image would be forever burned into my brain. It startled me so bad that I slammed the laptop shut, shaking as I sat back. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I wanted to lift the screen again, but I knew I had to, or Daniel would know someone touched his laptop. I raised it, staring at the image for a brief moment before clicking away from it nervously. I then made a decision. I needed to show this to Josh and Lilly in the morning. This was seriously messed up. I mean, I knew that Daniel was an artistic kind of guy, but this was insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly bolted back to my own room and scoured for my USB drive. Eventually, I found it and darted back to Daniel&amp;rsquo;s laptop, where I copied the image onto my USB. I stared at it for a little while longer. I was trying to dismiss it as mere photo manipulation, but there was just something so wrong about it. Perhaps it was the black, soulless eyes, or the fact that whoever or whatever this creature was, it was pulling up its mouth in such as weird and disturbing way. It almost looked forced. Like this thing had been made to pose in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook it off as mere paranoia and fixed up the laptop so that it didn&amp;rsquo;t look tampered with before I went back to my own room. Soon enough, I heard our front door open, then the sound of footsteps, then Daniel&amp;rsquo;s door locking. Daniel was back home&amp;hellip;but there were no signs of Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I waited until Daniel had gone out for one of his lectures. Since it was a Friday, Josh and I had the morning off. I decided now would be a good time to show him the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him if he wanted to see what Daniel had been hiding from us. He was confused, but also eagerly said yes. I brought my laptop into the living room, loaded up my USB, and opened the image for us both to see. Josh&amp;rsquo;s expression fell into shock before he started spluttering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wh&amp;hellip;What the fuck is that thing?!&amp;rdquo; I could tell by his reaction that both of us were on the same page. This couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been an art project image. There was no way that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; would pass as fine art, would it? I mean sure, art can be creepy at times, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine Daniel&amp;rsquo;s teachers appreciating such a disgusting picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know that Daniel can be a creepy son of a bitch, but&amp;hellip;that isn&amp;rsquo;t right. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to show Lilly thi-&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both cut off one another, then paused briefly before looking at each other in confusion. &lt;em&gt;Where was Lilly?&lt;/em&gt; I realized that she hadn&amp;rsquo;t come back with Daniel last night, and that neither of us had seen her that morning. When I explained to Josh, he began to worry. Lilly was never the kind to just sneak off and not tell anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up my phone and began to ring her mobile. For a while, there was silence. Then, from Lilly&amp;rsquo;s room, we heard a faint buzzing sound. Josh got up and walked inside rather quickly (he&amp;rsquo;d never been one to go into girls&amp;rsquo; rooms). He came back out holding Lilly&amp;rsquo;s phone in his hand with a worried look on his face. She was gone, and we had no way to get a hold of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;M&amp;hellip;Maybe she&amp;rsquo;s just gone to a lecture and forgot her phone&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I stuttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh shook his head, chewing on his lip from nerves. &amp;ldquo;No, Lilly doesn&amp;rsquo;t have lectures on a Friday, remember? She&amp;rsquo;d at least say hello to us and take her phone! She lives on that thing; she never stops texting her girlfriend.&amp;rdquo; He was right. Lilly&amp;rsquo;s life revolved around her phone. We knew there was no way she&amp;rsquo;d leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, it lit up. Someone was calling her. We both looked at it, then back at one another before Josh passed it to me. I brought it up to my ear before speaking. &amp;ldquo;Hello?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the line was her girlfriend. I recognized her husky voice. &amp;ldquo;Ah! Lilly, there you are. Thank God you&amp;rsquo;re okay&amp;hellip;you didn&amp;rsquo;t text me at all last night or this morning&amp;hellip;I thought something was wrong!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cringed a little bit, realising I had to break it to her that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t Lilly. As I spoke, I heard the girl begin to get upset. She was breathing quite heavily, and I could hear that sniffling sound someone makes when they cry. I felt so bad for her, but perhaps she was a chance to find out anything I could about Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;W&amp;hellip;Where is Lilly? She hasn&amp;rsquo;t spoken to me since last night. I thought she was just playing a joke on me, but now I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo; I looked at Josh with a confused stare as he began to pace around a little bit. I put the phone on loudspeaker and asked her: &amp;ldquo;Why do you think Lilly was playing a joke on you? Did she say anything odd?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; her girlfriend replied. &amp;ldquo;She sent me one message at around 1:30am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glanced at Josh, baffled, before I asked again. &amp;ldquo;What did the message say?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Help me.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and Josh had wide and worried eyes. Lilly would never pull this kind of prank on anyone, let alone her own girlfriend. She always told us how worried she was about her getting paranoid, so we knew she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t send a message like that unless she had a good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to speak to the girl, but I was getting nowhere. I reassured her that we knew where Lilly was and that she&amp;rsquo;d be calling her back tonight. Her girlfriend seemed suspicious, but agreed and put the phone down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myself and Josh paced back and forth. We had no idea what this could mean. Why would Lilly send a message like that? We continued to think for a while, deciding that, until we knew where she was, we were going to skip our lectures. We spent a long time thinking over things, and began to write down the connections we could make. Afterwards, Josh read out the list to me so I could think it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;First, Lilly goes into Daniel&amp;rsquo;s room at around 10:00pm. She&amp;rsquo;s locked in. Then we return home at 2:00am. During that time, at around 1:30am, we know that Lilly asked her girlfriend for help. You discover that neither Lilly or Daniel are home yet. Daniel&amp;rsquo;s door is unlocked and his laptop has been left on. You find the image and then leave. You then return to your room and heard Daniel come home, but not Lilly. Lilly is still not back home yet, but Daniel is&amp;hellip;what the hell could this all mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought over it for a while, then came to a conclusion. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to make this connection, but it was the only one I could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Daniel did something to Lilly. We have to confront him tonight if Lilly doesn&amp;rsquo;t come home between now and then, okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh looked shocked, but he agreed. Daniel would be our only chance of finding out what happened to Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that night, there were still no signs of her. We knew that her girlfriend would be calling soon, so we decided to turn the phone off. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to reassure her with false information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 6:00pm before Daniel finally came home. He looked rather startled to see us both standing there in the living room. He lightly placed his art folder and satchel down against the sofa as we both stood up. Josh spoke first, and I could tell he was trying to keep his composure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Daniel, we&amp;rsquo;d like to have a talk&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s about Lilly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;rsquo;s eyes seemed to widen ever so slightly, but it was nothing I considered worth thinking over. He tilted his head at us, looking confused as he asked, &amp;ldquo;Why? Is&amp;hellip;something wrong?&amp;rdquo; I shook my head. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want him to think we were accusing him of anything; we would never get any answers out of him that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did look a little on edge, though, glancing away from us as he itched his wrist under his baggy grey jumper. He pushed his rather dark black bangs out of his face as he spoke. &amp;ldquo;Then what is it? Is she okay? I mean, I know she left her phone here last night, so I suppose there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any way to get ahold of her&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything. We weren&amp;rsquo;t too sure about how to proceed. How were we supposed to ask him if he did anything to Lilly without him taking offense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then realised something. It took me a moment to process before I spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;You just said she left her phone here last night, right? How the hell did you know that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh&amp;rsquo;s eyes lit up. He&amp;rsquo;d just realised, too. How did Daniel know she&amp;rsquo;d left her phone behind unless they went somewhere? We already acknowledged the fact that Lilly never left her phone anywhere, so how on earth was he aware of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel didn&amp;rsquo;t answer. He was silent for a while before he pushed past us and walked into his room, slamming the door shut. We walked over to his door, banging on it harshly before he started shouting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Leave me alone! I have coursework to do! I&amp;rsquo;m sure Lilly will show up tonight, just&amp;hellip;stop being so paranoid!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. Daniel clearly knew a lot more than he lead on, but there was no way we were going to get it out of him. We walked back into the living room and slumped down. I ran a hand through my hair. What the hell was going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then realised that Daniel had left his bags on the sofa. He must have been too flustered to pick them up when he stormed into his room. I peered around to his door. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t left yet, but I knew soon enough, he would be coming out to get his bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a moment of madness, I picked up the satchel and emptied its contents onto the coffee table. I could see Josh&amp;rsquo;s eyes widen before he whispered to me frantically. &amp;ldquo;W-What the hell are you doing? What if he sees you?!&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t care. I needed to know anything I could about Lilly. She was a roommate, but also a best friend. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just leave this to solve itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pushed through documents and came across what looked like a ticket. I crumpled it up and pushed it into my pocket, then found a zipped-up document bag. I pushed it into Josh&amp;rsquo;s hands and told him to go hide it. He complied and put it in his room. I then quickly placed all the other stuff back into Daniel&amp;rsquo;s bag and rested it up just how it looked before, before walking into Josh&amp;rsquo;s room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched Daniel go back to the living room and pick up his bags before entering his room again Josh grabbed the zip-up file from under his pillow as we both sat down on his bed. We didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything. We just read the front cover of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Teeth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sent chills up my spine. I knew that whatever was inside would have a connection to the image I found on the computer&amp;hellip;but otherwise, what we saw was nothing like we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/teeth-jpg/floor.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/teeth-jpg/floor.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;floor.jpg&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a series of photographs. The first was of what looked like an abandoned room of sorts. The walls were covered in old floral wallpaper, and the floor was just damp wood. It looked like it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been used in years. The next pictures were of plastic tools. We noticed that they were linked to dentistry. You know, like needles and drills. It was pretty creepy, but what came after made us both drain of colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were photos of Lilly smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flipped through every single one of her. In each, she had her big toothy grin on display. Such a sweet smile. One of its most distinct features was a large front tooth. The left one. We always found it cute&amp;hellip;but now it was no laughing matter. We noticed labels on the back of the photographs, and that each tooth on each photo was marked. There were notes attached that said things like &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;remove&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;replace&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. It knocked Josh sick, and I was more terrified now than ever. We knew we couldn&amp;rsquo;t confront Daniel about these photos. It would get us nowhere. We just sat in silence for a long time, staring at them in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then remembered the ticket I&amp;rsquo;d found and stuffed in my pocket. I pulled it out with a shaky hand, bringing it to my vision. It read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group Ticket: 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location: Station Road&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date/Time: 28/09/2011, 11:34pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both looked at each other with firm gazes. That was just yesterday evening. We knew exactly what we had to do now. We had to find where Lilly was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t see Daniel for the rest of the evening. Josh had become incredibly paranoid. He asked if he could sleep in my room tonight; I thought it was a bit awkward, but didn&amp;rsquo;t mind. I mean, he was scared real bad, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave him alone. While Josh was sleeping, I printed off the disturbing image for referencing, then spent most of the night planning for the next day. I had already emailed our lecturers letting them know we weren&amp;rsquo;t going to show up, because we &amp;ldquo;felt sick&amp;rdquo;. I also checked how far Station Road was. To my surprise, it was only an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive away, so I figured we could take Josh&amp;rsquo;s car up there and look around for where Daniel and Lilly had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole time, I kept staring at the teeth.jpg image. A horrible thought crept into my mind. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to think about it, but it could have been a possibility. &lt;em&gt;Was the person in the picture Lilly?&lt;/em&gt; Every time I thought about it, I&amp;rsquo;d shake it off, telling myself I was just being paranoid&amp;hellip;but it all added up. The timing, the photographs&amp;hellip;it would make sense. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to believe it, and I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to until we found Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, myself and Josh got ready at around 6:00am. We wanted to be out of the dorm before Daniel woke up, and we made sure to lock our own doors. We also decided to take Lilly&amp;rsquo;s phone with us. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave anything behind that would indicate we were being suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we left the dorm and got into Josh&amp;rsquo;s car. I had brought along a small bag full of different things, such as the photographs, a flashlight, a camera, and a notepad with a pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We loaded ourselves into the car and made our way towards Station Road, able to pinpoint it with my mobile GPS. When we got there, we found that it was in a rather abandoned-looking area of town. The place was practically deserted. All we could see were tall, crumbling buildings and little, empty houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took out the photo of the room and began to walk up to each house. We pressed our faces to their windows to see if we could make out the floral wallpaper like the room in the photograph. We spent a good few hours doing this, but for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were getting pretty angry at this point. We just wanted Lilly back. Josh got so mad that he walked up to one of the house walls and started kicking it harshly, shouting from the top of his lungs, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Daniel, you sick bastard!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/teeth-jpg/w-basement-door.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/teeth-jpg/w-basement-door.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;W Basement door&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as he kicked the wall one last time, we noticed it begin to tear. Josh looked down at his foot and realised he had ripped what appeared to be a piece of painted paper away from it. He quickly tore down the remaining pieces to reveal what looked like an outdoor basement. The doors were rusty and scratched, but we noticed that the metallic handle was clean&amp;hellip;as if it had been tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh looked over his shoulder to me. I gave him a nod and quickly took a photo of the layout of this basement-like thing. Josh then walked down to the doors and gave them a push. To both of our surprises, they were blocked by a plank of wood, which Josh was thankfully able to remove fairly easily. We then opened the doors slowly and cautiously. Who knew what could&amp;rsquo;ve been kept in there? It was obviously hidden for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only we knew what was was coming. Perhaps it would have saved us both from throwing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stepped inside, we were met with a rancid odour. Neither of us knew what the smell was, but it made us both feel instantly sick. Josh gagged and coughed, covering his face with his shirt. I swallowed back vomit as I walked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my flashlight and shined it across the pitch-black stone room. We heard nothing, but as we walked further inside, the smell only thickened. It was getting so bad that Josh threw up behind me. He quickly composed himself and stumbled back upright before we continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I looked around the space, my eyes met with something on the floor that made my heart race and the flashlight drop from my grasp. It was Lilly&amp;rsquo;s knitted sweater. The one she always wore when we went out for pizza or bowling, with the same little torn threads on her sleeves where she&amp;rsquo;d chew on it. I could see Josh from my peripheral; his eyes were just as wide as mine, the last bit of colour drained from his face. I picked up the sweater, holding it up in front of me when I noticed there was a large, thick bloodstain soaked all the way through it. It started from the collar and became thinner as it went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was now the one to throw up. I collapsed onto my knees, puking heavily. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what to think. I soon composed myself and stood up again, gripping the flashlight as I put the sweater in my bag. Through blurred, teary eyes, I pressed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From where I was standing, there was nothing left to see. Then, there was the flicker of a small switch from behind me, red light filling the corner of the room. Josh screamed louder than anything I had ever heard before. My stomach was in knots as I shined my light where he was standing. He was beside a large, black table, just standing there in complete terror, blocking my view of it. I could only imagine what he was looking at, and I truly wish I left it to my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked over to his side. There, I laid my eyes on the sight before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Lilly. She was strapped down onto a table, wearing nothing but her jeans. Her body was covered in thick layers of tape, keeping her strapped down. One of her arms dangled down to her side; the other was nowhere to be seen. Its replacement was a taped-up stub covered in bloodstains. I could hardly breathe. My stomach was so knotted and my breathing so tight that all I could do was stare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up at Lilly&amp;rsquo;s face. Her head had been forced back, and we could see that her innocent blue eyes had been violently gouged out. They&amp;rsquo;d been replaced with thick, black wax that filled the holes. Her nose had been contorted and broken, snapped in many places&amp;hellip;but the worst part of it all was her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her jaw had been forced open, her maw filled with the same black wax. Her teeth had been ripped out and misplaced in all different directions, and her lips had been stretched upright, tearing her cheek to reveal more teeth that had been pulled from her mouth. It gave her a contorted, horrible smile. Her face was covered in streams of her own dried-up blood. I stared at the hand that was holding the mouth open. It was her own. &lt;em&gt;Her&lt;/em&gt; hand had been stitched to the ripped cheek. The flesh was torn and falling apart under her nails, which were cracked and chipped, staples and little threads holding them in place. The red fluorescent light created horrific shadows, and highlighted every grotesque feature now visible on Lilly&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I silently and numbly pulled out the picture of &amp;ldquo;teeth.jpg&amp;rdquo;, stared at it, then looked back at the real thing. They were identical. Josh brought a shaky hand over Lilly&amp;rsquo;s cheek before he collapsed by the side of the table. I could hear him sobbing horrendously by her side before he passed out next to me. I too felt like I was on the brink of collapsing, but something caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could feel the presence of someone else entering the room&amp;hellip;but I already knew who it was. I knew now there was nothing we could do. I heard the doors slam shut, the plank of wood being placed over them. I heard the sound of footsteps, inching closer and closer, until I could feel their presence behind me. I knew he was there, and I knew there was no way out. I heard his voice speak very faintly behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry you had to find out this way&amp;hellip;but it&amp;rsquo;s okay. It&amp;rsquo;s all for the sake of art.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t what made me collapse. I knew well enough that my fate was sealed. After he finished speaking, though, I heard one more tiny sound that made my heart ache and my tears stream further down my numb cheeks, before my vision faded away and my hands slipped from the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear Lilly choking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>The Harbinger Experiment</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world we live in is full of things we don&amp;rsquo;t understand. Being the curious humans that we are, we naturally try and seek these things out. Doing so has led us to remarkable discoveries and inventions that we never could have imagined a hundred years ago. We have defeated disease, built to the sky itself and even created machines that could take us beyond the clouds and into the stars. If our ancestors could see us and what we have created, I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of them would see us as gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our innate curiosity and lust for knowledge has not always led us to greatness, however. True evil and darkness have also been uncovered in humanity&amp;rsquo;s conquest of knowledge. And in the end, I fear this evil will be our doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not say this from the standpoint of a great philosopher who has sat and simply pondered things either, no, I say this because I have seen it; experienced it. I was a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event I am about to relay to you is true in its entirety, this I swear. I feel certain that this will fall on deaf ears and many of you will believe this to be just another spooky story meant to give you cheap thrills, but I promise you that this is neither my intent nor my purpose. The purpose of this story is to simply warn you of what lurks beyond the veil of what we can see and understand; to show you what awaits us in the darkness. Even if I myself don&amp;rsquo;t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am about to tell you has happened, and I feel certain it will happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971 a not-so-well-known scientist began preparations for an extremely secretive project known simply as &amp;ldquo;The Harbinger Experiment&amp;rdquo;. I would like to keep the identity of the scientist a secret for personal reasons, so throughout this recounting I will refer to him as &amp;ldquo;Zimmerman&amp;rdquo;. Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s background is unclear at best beyond 1971. All that is known about him before that time is that he had grown up somewhere in Maryland with a strange fascination of the occult and supernatural. This later made him an outcast among his fellow scientists due to how scoffed upon the metaphysical was (and still is) at the time. Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s opinions concerning the &amp;ldquo;other worldly&amp;rdquo; were not the sole cause for him being an outcast though; it was his methods that made him widely unaccepted among his peers. Zimmerman was well known during his time for being ruthless and cold beyond measure. He never cared about the means; all that mattered to him was results, and if he predicted the results to be valuable enough, anything would be worth obtaining them. It was this insatiable and brutal lust for the truth that made him feared among those that knew of him. And the few that knew of him and did not fear him believed in him and followed him and his work closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word harbinger itself has such a mysterious and intimidating taste to it. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the way it rolls from our tongues or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s simply due to its association with the project, but the word always seems to carry a certain amount of doom with it. Which would make sense, the word itself means to warn or forebode. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s reason for giving the experiment this title, but in retrospect, it fits perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman came to a select few (me being one of them), he told us he was working on &amp;ldquo;something big&amp;rdquo; and that he needed people who could keep confidentiality and not spread idle gossip of his work. While he did not fully trust some of us, he did know that we were professionals and that for some reason or another, we were all in dire need of employment. I had worked at the local clinic as a doctor, but I was caught stealing medication and was promptly fired. This left a very dark mark on my resume, so work was hard to find. I was also a native to Alaska and lived near where the experiment would take place, so I guess you could say I was a convenient choice. As you can imagine, I jumped at the opportunity. It was hard not to when I saw the payout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen of us were hired in total. Some were colleagues of his that has been working with him for a while, some were maintenance workers and a few were hired as &amp;ldquo;private security&amp;rdquo;. I was the only medical professional to be hired. It is still a wonder to me how he even attained the funds necessary for the experiment, I would not be wholly surprised if his financing was not entirely legal. But legal or not, I needed the money and he was paying. Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s a decision I have come to regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Zimmerman obtained his money, he used it to buy a relatively large plot of land deep in the frozen wilderness of Alaska. And upon that piece of land Zimmerman built a concrete structure, not dissimilar to a bunker in fact. The sole difference being that its goal was to keep any potential damage contained within the structure rather than keeping it out, as he put it. Most of the structure dug underneath the earth which had the effect of making the underground complex seem so much smaller than it really was from the outside, as would be expected. There was only one way of entering and leaving the underground structure, and it was via a ladder that led from a small unassuming concrete building on the surface (which I will refer to from now on as the entrance building for convenience) to the network below. After everyone had gone to bed at night, the hatch that contained the ladder would be sealed off with a very large and thick metal lid. Zimmerman was very strict about this. Located not too far away from the entrance building was a series of wooden cabins that would serve as the sleeping quarters for the staff Zimmerman had hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the entrance building standing on the surface, the underground system was massive. At the center of the complex was the control room. This is where all the facility&amp;rsquo;s electronics and such were linked to, this included security cameras, lights and door controls. Consoles, monitors and computers lined the walls of this large central chamber. This is also where the ladder in the entrance building connected to in the underground complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connected to the control room were three doors; one led to a smaller room that served as the infirmary, another door led to a break room and the last door led into the hallways. The hallways are where the complex began to feel extremely eerie. They were for some reason laid out in an extremely confusing scheme that led in circles and to complete dead ends. These hallways made up a vast majority of the complex and it would be very easy to get lost in the maze if you were unfamiliar with the complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you knew where you were going you would find yourself standing before one of three eight by eight foot rooms before long. Each room had a camera hooked up to one of the corners of the room and all three of those cameras were connected to a corresponding monitor in the control room. Cameras were also scattered throughout the hallways so that whoever was watching their corresponding monitor could see anywhere they wanted to when they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thick metal doors stood at the entrance to each of the three eight by eight foot rooms and in order to open them you would have to enter a four digit code into a panel located near the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first arrived at the complex how badly the hallways frightened me. I have always been claustrophobic you see, and those hallways were so very narrow. The noise (or, more accurately, the lack of noise) was also a tremendous source of fear for me in those bleak, narrow hallways. It was always so unnaturally silent, as if the entire world had stopped moving. It really made you feel like you were trapped down there. Thankfully though, I only rarely ventured into those hallways for I was the only medical professional in the facility and I had virtually no reason to go into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning I found it so peculiar that Zimmerman would ask for a medical professional like me on a project like this but by the time it was all over, I understood why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official purpose of the Harbinger experiment was to test and observe the effects of extended isolation on the human mind. This is what was listed on reports being sent out at least. But unbeknownst to all those who were not participating in the project, excluding the subjects, the true purpose was much darker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said before, Zimmerman had always had an obsession with the occult and supernatural. He sought to prove himself to those who did not believe in him. He wanted physical proof that the supernatural was a real phenomenon, and he wanted to be the first one to attain said proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true purpose of the Harbinger experiment was to find proof of the metaphysical; a world we could not see. The thought of doing this was naturally a tad bit daunting and even scary, but it was Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s method of doing so that was truly terrifying. Zimmerman believed that he would be able to open a portal between worlds momentarily, allowing three random &amp;ldquo;entities&amp;rdquo; to cross over to our world, and each one these beings would be trapped within one of the three rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman had the theory that any &amp;ldquo;entity&amp;rdquo; would try and latch onto the nearest living thing that had the capacity for it. He wanted to use this &amp;ldquo;technique&amp;rdquo; to trap a spirit in a physical form by allowing it to enter a living being that had been injected with compound mixture of Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, this compound would keep the entity from simply leaving whatever it was attached to; the only way it would be able to leave a host who had been injected with the compound was through death. According to Zimmerman, the host would have to be something living, with a will strong enough to survive the possession. And there is only one known species that possess the amount of will required for this; humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman had also done something to ensure that the entities would only enter the three rooms and that there would only be one entity in each room, though I cannot say I know what exactly he did. In fact, I know next to nothing when it comes to how Zimmerman managed to do what he did. He liked to keep his methodology a secret to his most trusted colleagues, most likely due to his paranoia that someone would steal his ideas and take credit for the success of said ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had known that this was the true purpose before I signed up, I may have reconsidered. But Zimmerman decided not to tell us until we were all gathered at his &amp;ldquo;fortress&amp;rdquo;. Even if any of us wanted to leave, I doubt we would have been allowed to do so. The security team Zimmerman had hired was loyal to him and the payout; it is not likely that Zimmerman had given them the order to now allow anyone to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three different subjects included in the experiment, all were native to Alaska and each one was lured into the project under the belief that they would be participating in a harmless study of the effect of isolation on the human mind, as I mentioned before. Which is why none of the subjects objected when they realized that they would be confined to one of the three rooms that I mentioned earlier. The first subject was a young man; he was apparently out of work and desperately needed the money that had been offered for participating in the study. The second was a woman; by looking at her, I could tell she was an addict of some sort. The third and final subject was an older man, a drifter if I had to guess. One thing that they all had in common was that none of them had any family or friends left. In short, no one would miss them, which is why they were chosen for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry, I wish I could supply more information about the subjects, but all of this has been drawn from memory and I was given little information on the three to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment did not officially begin until 1987, 16 years after its original announcement. I was eager to begin, so I packed up and headed out to the complex as soon as I could. I arrived at the compound a week before the subjects had even signed up, and a whole month before the project even began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not the first to arrive by any means. When I got there, Zimmerman, his colleagues and the security team had already arrived. I suppose you could say I was among the people Zimmerman did not trust to arrive first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone had arrived about a week before the experiment began. There was a noticeable rift between those who were there simply for the money (like me) and those who were followers of Zimmerman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 15th, 1987, all the preparations were in place. The subjects had been sealed in their rooms, the cameras, lights and speakers were fully operational and all the staff members had settled in; the time had come for the experiment to officially begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman asked everyone to report to the control room around 9 PM to witness the beginning of the experiment, he wanted everyone to be present when he proved that all his theories had been correct and that he was not just a madman; he wanted us all to see the fruits of his labor. When everyone had finally gathered in the large control room, Zimmerman turned to us and simply said, &amp;ldquo;Observe.&amp;rdquo; He then turned his back to us, leaned into the microphone that would project his voice through the three rooms and then he began chanting in a strange language that I feel certain no one but Zimmerman could understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all observed the three large monitors on the wall, silently waiting for something to happen. The subjects all stood in their room, dumbstruck by Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s chanting, staring at the monitors with confused expressions on their faces. After about five minutes, I felt something&amp;hellip; Awful. I cannot explain what exactly it was, but a horrible feeling of dread washed over me, riddling me with fear. It was then that the ground actually began to shake subtly and the lights began to flicker. Zimmerman continued chanting into the microphone as if nothing was off or wrong while the subjects began dashing around their rooms, screaming for help. Then suddenly the ground stopped shaking and the monitor&amp;rsquo;s image turned into static.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The air began to become very heavy as we all stared at the monitors, waiting for them to regain their image and show us what was happening or had happened in those three rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while all was silent, but then there was screaming. The screams of a woman going through unbearable pain and terror began to echo through the compound. The similar screams of men began to coincide with the woman&amp;rsquo;s terrified screams and together they mixed into an awful symphony of pain and fear that beat mercilessly into our ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who were here for the money began to give each other scared looks while those loyal to Zimmerman seemed completely unfazed. We wanted to leave and never come back to this awful place but we all knew deep down that Zimmerman would never allow that to happen. We were here for the long haul, there was no escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 10:13 PM when the screaming finally stopped; the monitors had yet to reveal to us what had occurred in those three rooms. As soon as the screaming ended, Zimmerman stood and dismissed us all for the night, adding that we were all forbidden to come back into the compound until 10:00 AM tomorrow morning, not like any of us wanted to. We all solemnly made our way out of the compound and towards the cabins and settled in for the night. I feel it is safe to say that not all of us slept well that night, and I was not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning all of the staff had arrived at the entrance building. We all stood inside exchanging tired or nervous looks as we waited for Zimmerman to arrive and open the hatch that concealed the ladder. I could see palpable fear in the eyes of some of us, while others did not seem to have been even remotely affected by what happened last night. Zimmerman showed up five minutes after 10:00, apologizing for his tardiness as he came through the door of the entrance building. He opened the hatch and, without any hesitation, began descending the ladder downwards into the black abyss. He almost seemed enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the first to follow behind Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s dark descent into the facility. It seemed that the farther I climbed down, the more the darkness closed in on me, as if it was trying to swallow me whole. And as I climbed deeper I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that this place was&amp;hellip; different somehow. While before there was only the unsettling concrete hallways and rooms, now there was something else&amp;hellip; Something made the eeriness feel so real and personified. I felt like a horrible and gruesome scene awaited us down there, but I continued climbing downward, despite my fear and my hesitation. This was no longer just a spooky bunker, there was darkness and malevolence in the air, a true evil now lived here, and I could feel it. We all could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally felt my foot touch ground and let out a silent sigh of relief to be on solid ground. Almost as if on cue, the light bulbs came alive, dousing the room in their warm and welcome light. Zimmerman must have turned on the power, I thought. I allowed myself to take a couple seconds to examine the control room. It was exactly as we had left it last night, for which I gave a silent and thankful prayer. It was almost as if nothing unusual had ever happened. I shook myself from my thoughts as I remembered the static filled monitors from the night before. I let my eyes slowly make their way towards the monitors on the wall, anticipating the grim and fearful scenes that would be on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My attention was first grabbed by monitor one and three, which were still pure static. It would have been a small relief, but then the motionless image on monitor two caught my eye. Room two was entirely still and everything seemed entirely untouched. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but gasp as I noticed the only thing that was different; the woman lay in the center of the small concrete room, an expression of fear and terror was frozen into her gaunt face as she lay silent and lifeless on her back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s expression turned angry when he saw this, he ordered that second monitor be turned off, and it was. We didn&amp;rsquo;t ask why, it&amp;rsquo;s not like any of us wanted to see the dreadful scene any longer. He also ordered that if the images in monitors one and three did not return within the next two hours, the security team would be sent to investigate the rooms. The security team nodded at hearing this. They made it seem as if they had no fear, but I could see it in their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subtly loud tick tock of the clock was the only sound that echoed through the control room while I stared at the monitors. An hour and fifty minutes had gone by, and static was still all that occupied monitor one and three. All of the other staff members were working except me, this was due to the fact that the project had been completely injury free thus far, so I essentially had nothing to do but wait for someone to hurt themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman, a couple of his colleagues and I were the only ones that occupied the room. They quietly chatted amongst each other on the other side of the room while I spent my time reading and pondering the situation I currently found myself in. I had clearly made a mistake coming here, the corpse lying in room two was evidence enough of this. And God only knew what awaited us in rooms one and three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts were soon interrupted as monitor three&amp;rsquo;s image returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clear image now displayed on the screen made everyone&amp;rsquo;s eyes noticeably widen. What was displayed on the monitor was&amp;hellip; horrifying. A humanoid&amp;hellip; thing stood in the center of the room staring directly at the camera, unmoving. It was wearing the jumpsuit that subject three had been issued, but this clearly was not the same man that had entered the room. What caught my attention first was its eyes. They were solid black and twice the size of normal human eyes; they seemed so&amp;hellip; so endless and so cold. Its head had also grown with the eyes in such a symmetrical and unsettling manner. The being had also shed all of the hair it once had and even from the monitor I could see how unnaturally smooth and clear its skin was. It had also seemingly grown in height and stature, which could be seen in the fact that the jumpsuit was now obviously far too small for its wearer. Its limbs had grown especially long; its arms hung almost as low as the creature&amp;rsquo;s knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we were looking at was in no way the same man we had sent inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear; fear was all I felt as I continued to stare into the monitor at the thing in the room. And my fear seemed to be shared by those around me, which made me feel kind of good. It may sound awful, but it was a bit satisfying to see that Zimmerman and his colleagues could feel fear too. But at the same time it was worrying because this showed that this was not part of Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;plan&amp;rdquo;. Something had gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all stared into the monitor at the thing despite our fear; it was almost as if we were in a trance. My already present fear began to grow and spread rapidly through my body as I became lost in the creature&amp;rsquo;s eyes, trapped in its terrifyingly hypnotic gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what felt like forever, I managed to break eye contact with the creature and divert my attention from the monitor, and when I did so, I felt my fear levels drop considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short while, Zimmerman ordered his security team to make their way to subject one&amp;rsquo;s door just as he said he would do. The security team left without question, armed only with batons and pistols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I focused my attention on watching the men progress through the hallways towards subject one&amp;rsquo;s room via the cameras. Even through the not-so-high-quality cameras, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard to tell that these men were afraid of what awaited them. Their heads were downcast as they walked; they did not possess the same confidence within them that they did when this project began. They looked like scared boys being sent off to a terrible war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, they made it to the door. We had perfect vision of them and the door via the hallway camera. One of them said something through one of their walkie-talkies and made a motion towards the camera, in response one of Zimmerman&amp;rsquo;s colleagues buzzed the door open. The men already had their pistols out by the time the button was pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, the door began to open. We all watched eagerly as the men began to approach the door, guns aimed inside. Suddenly and without warning, there was a loud shriek. And as something bounded out of the room at the men, the monitor turned into static. Immediately, we could hear screaming echoing down the hallways followed shortly after by the distinct sound of gunshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could do nothing but wait. After a couple minutes, the screaming and gunshots stopped. We all waited and prayed, hoping that whatever bounded at them from the room would not be the one to return to the control room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple more minutes, three of the men came back, carrying with them the corpse of the fourth. He had massive cuts covering his chest, and his face was shredded; you couldn&amp;rsquo;t even tell who he was anymore or even that he was human. I was used to gore, being a doctor and all, so I felt somewhat unfazed by the mass of shredded flesh and bloodied meat they carried with them. But many of the others went pale and vomited. The security team all wore emotionless expressions and eyes filled with terror. One of the men finally looked up at us; he stared at us for a while with those wide eyes of his. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s dead,&amp;rdquo; he finally managed to mutter in a shaken and scared voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple hours went by. The dead man&amp;rsquo;s name was Frank; he was buried outside in the cold, Alaskan ground. Two of the men were unharmed, physically at least. The third was alive, but only barely. His body was covered in bloody slashes and one of his eyes had been gouged out. I managed to stabilize him, but only just. The other two men vaguely explained what happened. Apparently, subject one leaped out at Frank after the door had opened; only it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really subject one anymore. According to them, it had a hideously contorted face and long sharp claws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim to have shot it over a dozen times before it fell dead, and then they emptied another dozen bullets into it just to be sure it was really dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only once it was dead did they come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tending to the wounded man, I went to investigate the monitors. As afraid as I was of seeing what those monitors may have held, I needed to see. Subject three was the only one left now and I needed to see it and make sure the creature was still in his room. It seemed to be more like a jail cell than an ordinary room at this point though, which was probably a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cameras displaying subject one&amp;rsquo;s room and the hallway outside it still displayed a static filled screen. No one was sent to repair them or investigate; we just had to hope that subject one was well and truly dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitor three&amp;rsquo;s image was exactly the same as I had left it; subject three was still staring directly into the camera at us. He was still in the exact same position and if it were not for the small fan in the corner of the room, I would think I was looking at a still image. In a way, I felt relief at seeing this; relief that he was still in his room and had not escaped while no one was looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After everything quieted down, I noticed something especially unusual. There was a&amp;hellip; strange sound emanating from somewhere. At first, it was barely noticeable. The only reason I heard it was because of how extremely quiet it was in the infirmary. But as time went by, it slowly began to increase in volume. After about an hour, it was loud enough that everyone else could hear it too. And after a couple more hours its volume had increased so much that we could determine what the noise was. It was a song; one of the staff members identified it as &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Living in the Sunlight&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Tiny Tim. Apparently, his father loved the song and listened to it frequently. The song seemed to be on a loop and kept replaying itself. Although we were able to identify the noise, we remained unable to identify its source. We knew that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t coming from the speakers because we had turned them off, it seemed to be emitting from the walls themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More time ticked by as we all began to become increasingly agitated by the song; I spent most of my time in the infirmary attending to Frank or in the control room. Fear hung in the air and the presence of unmistakable darkness and evil was no doubt its source. Subject three still had not moved; he had kept his unblinking gaze fixed on the camera the entire time. It always felt like he was staring directly at me, no matter where I was in the room. I think this effect was also felt by others due to the fact that they seemed to move around the room a lot and for seemingly no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours, the song was so loud that people almost had to shout in order to communicate. We had been trying to find its source so that we could turn the song off, but it was to no avail; the source was completely unidentifiable. This added a level of extreme irritation to our already very present fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around 8:30 that the ground itself began to shake once again; just as it had done the previous night. Panic began to spread among my fellow employees and me as the shaking grew in intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this, I had the sudden instinctual feeling to look over at subject three&amp;rsquo;s monitor. It was gone. Almost as if on cue, the power went out. And thankfully, the song did as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the security team came back, panic had been slowly building up among the staff, and Zimmerman was powerless to stop it. When those lights went out, the calm projections that everyone had been trying to maintain left us and the fear in all our hearts took over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergency backup lights kicked on shortly after the power went out, which I gave a silent thankful prayer for. The lights were dim, but they still allowed me to see a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total panic seized us as many of my fellow staff members began screaming and rushing to the ladder in an attempt to escape. But too many were trying to use it at once and no one was able to get very far on the ladder without someone else pulling them to the floor and taking their place. Zimmerman was shouting for everyone to calm down, but his dominating and intimidating personality had no effect here, and his demands fell upon deaf ears. It was total chaos. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long until people actually started hurting each other in their desperate attempts to get up that ladder and out of this place; I could only stand against the wall and wait for my opportunity to escape up the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the screams were soon silenced as the familiar hum of that unsettling song began to rise in volume again, only much quicker this time. And this time, it was clear that the noise was coming directly from the maze-like corridors. People stopped fighting and shouting as all our attention shifted to the door that led into the hallways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song quickly got louder than it had ever been before which forced many of us to cup our ears with our hands in an attempt to silence the noise. Then, suddenly, the song just completely stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence. That was all that filled the room as we all stared at the thick metal door in anticipation for what was coming. It felt like ages had gone by, but in reality it was probably only seconds before the silence was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door suddenly and violently burst open and the music started again, louder than it had ever been before. The suddenness and the volume of this caused many of us to recoil by falling to the ground and grabbing our ears in an attempt to block out the noise. I glanced up for just a second and in the doorway stood a tall, smooth skinned figure with long limbs and eyes so dark and malevolent that you could clearly see them in the dim lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got my bearings, I looked upwards at the creature once again just in time to see the thing pick up and rip Zimmerman in half in one fluid movement, dousing the room and everyone in it with his blood, intestines and organs. I was no stranger to gore, but the sight of that was too much for me to bear: I hunched over immediately after seeing this and vomited all over the cold cement floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That ladder is my only hope of survival&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself as I forced myself to a standing position. And as my eyes rose along with the rest of me, I could see the thing ripping and tearing through the people as they scattered in attempt to escape it. It was distracted, and as awful as it sounds, this was my only chance to get up that ladder. I forced my legs to move towards the ladder, trying to block out the terrified screams of my fellow staff members and the unbearably loud music. I could hear gunshots coinciding with the screams and terrible sounds of flesh being ripped apart somewhere in the mess of noise. I reached my hands outwards and felt a wave of relief wash over me as my fingers came into contact with the hard metal rungs of the ladder. I gripped them and began to climb upwards as quickly as I could in my disoriented state, all the while praying that the monster would not see me and pull me off the ladder and back into the slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like at any moment I would feel one of its smooth hands wrap around my ankles and pull me to my death, but I eventually made it to the top. There was no question in my mind, I had to close the hatch and seal that thing down there; even if it meant certain death for my colleagues. I could not allow that thing to escape. I gripped the thick metal lid and began to push with all my might in an attempt to seal the underground complex off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite how dense and sturdy it was, the lid was surprisingly easy to move and did not take very much effort to push it over the hatch, even in my weakened state. In seconds, the hatch was completely covered by the dense metal lid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collapsed on my side and began to vomit some more as exhaustion overtook me. And as I lay there, I realized something; aside from my labored breaths, the only thing I could hear was the faint echo of that song from down below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt as though I would lose more of my sanity if I continued to lay there and listen to that song, so I once again forced myself to my feet and began to make my way to the wooden lodge I had stayed in the previous night. It was where I had left my baggage and also where I had left the keys to my truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the fifteen staff members that took part in that forsaken experiment, I am the only one who survived. I have never returned to the awful place where all of this happened, and I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to. The project was very secretive and Zimmerman was the only one who knew all the details of it. And, as far as I know, no one is aware of my involvement aside from me. In fact, I am probably the only one who knows what the Harbinger experiment truly was, let alone what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, you are probably wondering why I have told all of you about something none of you should be aware of. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re expecting me to give you a speech about not messing with things you don&amp;rsquo;t understand or something along those lines. I hope not, for I have no speech to give or lesson to impart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began hearing a noise earlier today. Almost immediately I recognized the noise as a very haunting and familiar song. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even try to trace it to its source; I knew it would be pointless. And as the day has progressed, the song has increased in volume. It&amp;rsquo;s loud enough now that I can very clearly make out the lyrics. I am completely unable to escape Tiny Tim&amp;rsquo;s voice; it has followed me everywhere I have gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject three is coming for me, and I know my time left in this world is extremely limited now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you could say that I just wanted to tell the tale of the Harbinger experiment before it was lost forever. I hope that you will take some lesson from what I have recounted to you, but I think we both know you won&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, you don&amp;rsquo;t believe a word of what I&amp;rsquo;ve just told you. And I don&amp;rsquo;t blame you. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe me if I were you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To you, this is nothing more than something to get your cheap thrills from. You were probably mindlessly surfing the internet when you clicked a link and found yourself here, wherever here may be, reading this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t care if you believe me or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you do, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t stop you from trying to uncover the truth of a darkness that few of us have ever seen. It certainly never stopped Zimmerman. If you want a lesson, look at what happened to him when he went seeking the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray that none of you will ever discover this truth; I pray that none of you ever have to see the evil I have seen. I hope you all get to live in ignorance of what lies beyond the veil of what we can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s here now. I can feel its black eyes burning into me just as I could all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am as much to blame as Zimmerman is for the monstrosity that is now free to roam the world, even if I was not the one to create it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve written anything related to the Disney Corporation, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has been going on since my last post. I&amp;rsquo;ve received a lot of questions and concerns from folks who read my first-hand account of Mowgli&amp;rsquo;s Palace… a resort that was built and abandoned by Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone who mirrored by post. It&amp;rsquo;s been taken down from a few places, mostly corporate sites that were easily leaned on by a larger power. However, for every nuked topic or disappearing blog post, it seems like a hundred more have popped up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something they&amp;rsquo;ll have to face. There&amp;rsquo;s no turning back for them… none for me, either…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m definitely being followed. For the first month or two, I chalked it up to paranoia. Any casual glance or half-smile in my direction set me off. Hairs standing on the back of the neck and everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one, or rather, the first one I was actually able to spot, was a telephone worker milling around my apartment complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was middle-aged, doughy, dressed just as you&amp;rsquo;d expect, but something just seemed off about him. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t place it, but I knew this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just my imagination acting up. He was awkward and out of place, not somebody who was comfortable doing his routine job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed him around a corner, only to lose him there. When I turned back to go home, there he was. Staring directly at me, about ten feet behind me. Expressionless and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exploring?&amp;rdquo; he asked. That was all he said, and there was an accusing tone to his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me what blue collar phone jockey does that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the worst part. Never feeling safe. Never feeling alone. That, and the occasional Disney merchandise left somewhere for me to find. Little rubber Mickeys in the mailbox, a Disney Adventures magazine on my bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They hide little Mickeys everywhere. Three circles, one big, two small, in the silhouette of the famous mouse&amp;rsquo;s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started keeping a running list of Mickeys I&amp;rsquo;ve found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee cup rings on my coffee table. One big, two small. Colored glass bottles left on the doorstep, viewed from the top down. (All red.) Graffiti on the wall on my way to work; a huge Earth, small Sun and Moon in the proper locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have emailed me about this as well. If you repost anything I have to say, you&amp;rsquo;re going to start finding those son of a bitch outlines. I guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best one by far, one that actually made me laugh because of the horror of it all, was a drawing in chalk next my car. I was taken aback at first, walking through the parking garage, keeping an eye out for people following me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outline seemed a perfect match for… well, a &amp;ldquo;murder victim&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re probably familiar with if you&amp;rsquo;ve read my past posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in yellow… paint, I&amp;rsquo;m sure… was a single word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;RETRACT&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only good thing that has come out of all this is that I know I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who&amp;rsquo;s seen something they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give their names, because… well, if I have to tell you why, you haven&amp;rsquo;t been paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Researcher&amp;rdquo; goes to Disney parks whenever he can, all throughout the year. He&amp;rsquo;s not going to have fun, enjoy the rides, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s looking for the Gascots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a long tradition, apparently, of people reporting strange patrons throughout the park. Silent, motionless, staring patrons of every age, shape, and size. Men and women, adults, children, and teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All wearing Disney-themed gas masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back when, Disney would get tons of complaints about &amp;ldquo;oddly dressed&amp;rdquo; folks following others around the park. Folks who would then merge into crowds and disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, the gas masks caused folks to draw other conclusions, and reports of &amp;ldquo;possible terrorists&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bombers&amp;rdquo; started flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those reports most likely went straight into the trash can. I know I can&amp;rsquo;t find any sign of any such occasions reported on by the media. (Although you should be aware of the fact Disney can pretty much control its press like no other.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researcher goes to the parks, talks to a few people, and tries not to draw any attention to himself. He&amp;rsquo;ll just ask three or four families if they&amp;rsquo;ve seen &amp;ldquo;his friend&amp;rdquo;, who&amp;rsquo;s wearing a &amp;ldquo;funny mask&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has yet to see a gascot for himself… though on one occasion, a child pointed him toward Frontier town. As he raced through the crowd, he heard a single voice ahead cry out &amp;ldquo;Mommy! I want a Goofy air-mask too!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fellow I&amp;rsquo;ll call &amp;ldquo;Lifeguard&amp;rdquo; worked in a Disney water park from 2001 through 2003. He stood at the top of a huge water slide and made sure none of the kids got too rowdy. He passed the kids through, one at a time, telling them over and over again to be safe, keep their arms in, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, as he tells it, this fat kid goes down the tube and doesn&amp;rsquo;t come out the other end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s sent two or three kids after, the whole thing moves at a steady clip, so naturally you&amp;rsquo;d expect that if fatty got stuck, the kids that followed him were stuck, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so. Only the big kid disappears. Everyone else comes out the other end, cheering and splashing like nothing&amp;rsquo;s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifeguard shuts down the slide, much to the aggravation of the kids waiting. Before he can go through any of Disney&amp;rsquo;s strict procedures… SPLASH… fatty finally comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff members pulled the kid out of the water. He sank like a stone when he hit, his skin already blue and his eyes wide. All he would say was &amp;ldquo;No-face Kids&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Stop squeezing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kid was okay, in case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering. He got carted right off to the medical center. When Lifeguard was told to open the slide back up, he made a big stink about how it clearly wasn&amp;rsquo;t safe. Despite his complaints, he was threatened with firing and begrudgingly opened the slide again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that point on, he kept a closer eye on the kids. Every so often, they&amp;rsquo;d come out in the wrong order… never as stunned as the fat kid, but always with a vague look of concern… a dreamy half-stupor that seemed as if they were trying to figure out what was reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;d take on some water and choke a bit… and they&amp;rsquo;d never come back up to ride again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read his emails with the same sort of unease you might be feeling right now. I wanted him to share his own story, but in the end he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to expose himself that way. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I blame him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Snow White&amp;rdquo;, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t the actual role she played, was a &amp;ldquo;character&amp;rdquo; in the park. She had a nice little tidbit for me. You know what happens when a costumed employee drops dead in his suit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, one second he&amp;rsquo;s taking a picture with little Jimmy, and the next he&amp;rsquo;s had a fatal stroke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second costumed mascot in the area has to sit with the corpse on a curb or bench and wait for a designated &amp;ldquo;Dry Cleaner&amp;rdquo; to arrive and cart the body away in a discrete manner. All the while, patrons have no idea they&amp;rsquo;re sitting with a dead body for photo ops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to check your photo albums at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was bad, but another fellow, &amp;ldquo;Janitor&amp;rdquo;, went completely off the creepy charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney World (and probably others) is built with a series of underground tunnels just below your feet. Three stories&amp;rsquo; worth. Anything and everything you can imagine is down there, for use of the employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re called Utilidors. Utility Corridors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, that&amp;rsquo;s the reason you don&amp;rsquo;t see character out of place or Janitors wandering through the park. They pop in and out of hidden doors, and travel a concealed town you&amp;rsquo;re walking on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janitor told me something that might be common knowledge, but was nonetheless news to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney had several apartments built into his parks. There&amp;rsquo;s one above Cinderella&amp;rsquo;s Castle… there&amp;rsquo;s one in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. They&amp;rsquo;re all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, there are night clubs, a movie theater, a bowling alley, and much more. All behind doors built right into the whimsical facades you passed by without a second look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Club 22 is one such hidden area. If you have the cash to join the exclusive club (you don&amp;rsquo;t) then you&amp;rsquo;ll have access to it and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Club 22 is a place where anything goes. Disney Co. calls these places &amp;ldquo;Dark Zones&amp;rdquo;. Spots where the squeaky-clean visage of Mickey Mouse gives way to drinking, drugs, and, yes, sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the rest of the park is the &amp;ldquo;Bright Zone&amp;rdquo;, with a few &amp;ldquo;Gray Zone&amp;rdquo; utilodors between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as Janitor has said, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always that way. It was more of a slow decline and the gradual relaxation of social norms within that elite group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason he knows all of this? You may have already guessed - He&amp;rsquo;s cleaned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy background check and a non-disclosure form, Janitor moved up from a park attendant to one of the Dark Zone cleaning crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before you get some Satanic &amp;ldquo;human sacrifice&amp;rdquo; vision in your head, Janitor saw nothing of the sort. Lots of empty alcohol bottles? Yes. Used condoms scattered like deflated New Years balloons? Oh, yeah. He cleaned up his share of blood, piss, and vomit, but it was all down to the unrestricted behavior of patrons as opposed to any sort of cult behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least that&amp;rsquo;s how he sees it in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that trash, that profane shit, went into a furnace and mingled with the smoke of a quaint cottage&amp;rsquo;s chimney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been to Disney World, you&amp;rsquo;ve breathed ultra-condensed sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backing up this information was &amp;ldquo;Hammer&amp;rdquo;. Hammer mailed me the old-fashioned way, though I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he got my home address. He sent me photocopies of work papers proving his employment, with the instruction to burn them when I was convinced.
Which I did gladly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammer worked around the Disney World park, doing demolition and construction. At one point, he approached a superior regarding some strange construction plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was wide, rectangular area marked off on the blueprints, about the size of a supermarket. The area was left unnamed, and only bore the words &amp;ldquo;DO NOT DIG&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was his superior in the dark, but he was super-fucking-purposefully in the dark. He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about it, didn&amp;rsquo;t want to know about it, and ended the conversation with &amp;ldquo;this space intentionally left blank&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammer didn&amp;rsquo;t get it. The area seemed a waste of space, and it was directly conflicting with the work his team had been given. He started poking around the area on his off-time, finding only a derelict steel door, and a great span of concrete just beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a &amp;ldquo;supermarket&amp;rsquo;s worth&amp;rdquo; of blank, gray floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, Hammer started picking gascots out of the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike all other reports, the people… the things… would stand in full view of the guy. They&amp;rsquo;d cluster together in the distance, or they&amp;rsquo;d just be pressed against a wall when he turned a corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said they &amp;ldquo;moved weird&amp;rdquo;, like they were weak or injured… like a deer that&amp;rsquo;s been run down by a hunter and can&amp;rsquo;t flee anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gasmasks… the Disney character faces with filters jammed in… he noted that they seemed wet on the inside, like condensation on a car window. Tiny beads of water glimmered behind the glass, making it impossible for any of them to actually see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probing further, Hammer started asking questions of anyone and everyone who had been working in the park for a decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hit dead ends throughout, until he was directed to Ida, an elderly woman who worked in a restaurant on Main Street. She&amp;rsquo;d been there since way back, and though nobody had the balls to ask directly, everyone KNEW she had plenty of terrible stories to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammer asked about the empty space, then about the gas-masked customers, and at first he thought he would receive the same non-answers he&amp;rsquo;d gotten so far. She was quiet. Eerily quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Room Zero.&amp;rdquo; She croaked, a single, shaking hand placed to her cheek as if she were a little girl fearing a Father&amp;rsquo;s punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;rsquo;t meet the man&amp;rsquo;s gaze for the entire conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room Zero, as it turned out, was yet another hidden room just like the apartments and Club 22. However, its sheer size and its spot deep beneath the park set it apart from any of the &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; dark zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bomb shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room Zero was built to withstand a massive attack, be it conducted by foreign or domestic enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room Zero was to be stocked with enough rations to feed the entire park&amp;rsquo;s average number of patrons at any given moment, and housed a smaller yet lavish &amp;ldquo;panic room&amp;rdquo; of sorts for Disney higher-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, official Disney gas masks were actually produced for children to wear in the event of an attack. The idea was that it would be less scary for kids if Mickey&amp;rsquo;s face was emblazoned on the wartime safety device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know the obvious problems with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War scare of the 60s, when Disney World was constructed, Room Zero was stocked with similar masks, as well. Whether they cared about the fears of children, or just callous branding, the things found their way down there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s more, some genius decided that kids would THEN be frightened by the gas masks their parents wore… and so all masks, adult and child, were made to comply to this insane standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ida described it as &amp;ldquo;Treating a wound with lemon juice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this explained what Hammer had been seeing, though. Not only the seemingly supernatural appearances, but the emptied out room as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in there,&amp;rdquo; he explained, &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing but a cement floor and four walls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; Ida shook her head and covered her mouth, stifling a sob, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve been on top of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone or something sounded the alarm one day, when the park was at full capacity. The warning was clear. It was supposedly an air attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security ushered everyone down, down, down into the tremendous shelter. There, they were ordered to put on their masks and hunker down for the duration fo the assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was quiet for about thirty minutes, save for the crying children and the frightened whispers. No one wanted to die, and so they were thankful in a way for this strange measure of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the first scream rang out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; a man shouted, &amp;ldquo;Quit pinching!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waves of shrieks and yelps rippled through the crowd, from one wall to the other, back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s running around? Settle down!&amp;rdquo; Someone hollered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s laughing? This isn&amp;rsquo;t funny!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ow! Who stepped on my foot?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite security guards&amp;rsquo; urging to calm down and keep their cool, the crowd became more and more agitated until, finally, after nearly an hour of madness…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lights flickered…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed could only be described as utter chaos. In the dark, only the wails of the young and the anguished cries of adults could be heard in a massive, swelling din that bloodied the ears of all within that black echo chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of staff members and a select few patrons made it out of the door, ready to face the War above rather than the insanity below. What they found, of course, was a desolate, yet untouched theme park. The music continued to play, echoing through silent storybook towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon returning to Room Zero, the few who stood at the top of the steel staircase that lead down into the pitch blackness heard no sign of the previous fray. There was only silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ida herself descended that staircase despite the begging of those she left above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She reached the reinforced doors, herself now awash in darkness and hearing only the buzzing in her ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single voice came out of the darkness. The echo made it impossible to tell whether the mocking, raspy voice was at the back of the bomb shelter, or if it was right in front of her face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shut the door, dear. You&amp;rsquo;re letting out the cold.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gripped by terror, she did just that. Within days, the entire thing… shelter, staircase, all of it… was covered with feet upon feet of cement. Air systems and generators above its ceiling were removed, creating the large, empty space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re all still down there.&amp;rdquo; Ida told Hammer, &amp;ldquo;Down there with whoever that was.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice I&amp;rsquo;ve used Ida&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, she passed away soon after telling her story. Accidental fall, supposedly, after getting out of bed to turn on a light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Such a company devotee,&amp;rdquo; the paper reported, &amp;ldquo;that her entire bedroom was covered with Mickey silhouettes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray, for devils have no reason&lt;br&gt;
Satan waits to curse your ways&lt;br&gt;
Have you seen it in his eyes in the sunset?&lt;br&gt;
Have you wondered if he&amp;rsquo;s laughing when he plays?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&amp;ndash;Kansas, &amp;ldquo;The Devil Game&amp;rdquo;&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a set of instructions for how to speak with the Devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, as those of you with any sort of brains at all might note, is a patently moronic proposition on the face of it; one likely to culminate in any number of thoroughly unpleasant fates. Honestly, it would probably be smarter to publish your credit card number on Facebook, or take up a career in crocodile-wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, that isn&amp;rsquo;t going to stop you, is it? Not if you&amp;rsquo;re sincerely interested, at least. Technically, if you do everything just right, there&amp;rsquo;s a fair chance you&amp;rsquo;ll walk away scot-free; and that seems to be reason enough for some people to decide that it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea. Especially if you&amp;rsquo;re the fate-tempting, thrill-seeking, scare-junkie type. Or the desperate type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to a point of clarification I ought to make. This is NOT a manual for making any kind of Faustian bargain&amp;mdash;you know, the whole sell-your-soul type of deal. If you happened to bring it up in conversation, He certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be one to refuse. Following through with such a foolhardy bargain, however, would necessitate removing some of the protections you will put in place for your conversation, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to spell out why that would be a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; idea. If you&amp;rsquo;re really mathematically impaired enough to want to trade something that will last an infinite number of years for something that might last about ninety (tops), there are plenty of other rituals out there for you to follow. This one, if performed correctly, should only allow the two of you to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, perhaps, begs the question of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; exactly you would want to speak with the Devil in the first place. Maybe some of you just like the idea of making small talk with extremely dangerous occult entities, but for the sake of the human race, I hope most of you aren&amp;rsquo;t quite that stupid. The short answer is: he &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; things. Things that some of you may have a deep, vested interest in finding out. I mean, he&amp;rsquo;s not omniscient or anything&amp;mdash;much as he might like to pretend otherwise, he&amp;rsquo;s not God&amp;mdash;but he&amp;rsquo;s definitely got a supernatural advantage over the kind of knowledge any human would be able to obtain. For example, he probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to predict when the next World War will happen, or tell you the cure for cancer&amp;hellip; but he could very well be able to predict the winning numbers of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s five-hundred million dollar Powerball drawing, or tell you what deadly, undiagnosed condition might be afflicting one of your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Prince of Darkness doesn&amp;rsquo;t just go around giving out winning lottery numbers to anybody who asks. And trusting any sort of information obtained from a being commonly described as &amp;ldquo;the father of all lies&amp;rdquo; is liable to land you in a worse situation than you were in when you started. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re really dead set on finding something out and you&amp;rsquo;ve exhausted all other options, there IS a way to try to get accurate information out of the guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, like so many of the more urbane villains in popular culture, the Devil has a bit of a penchant for games and gambling. Of course, the reason he likes them so much is that he almost always wins. Unless you happen to be a fiddler named Johnny or are being represented by Daniel Webster, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to get your ass handed to you. But if you&amp;rsquo;re determined enough to want to face the risks and long odds, there&amp;rsquo;s a certain game the two of you could play to try to win the information you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, though. We&amp;rsquo;ll start off with a description of the summoning process, then get into the rules of the game, some tips for how to play, and finally, of course, the inevitable litany of arcane shit that might go horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to contact your conversational partner, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to go to a church at midnight. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what kind of church&amp;mdash;large or small, old or new, liberal or conservative&amp;mdash;just as long as you&amp;rsquo;re sure it will be empty. The last thing you want is for some preacher to walk in on you while you&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of this (for the sake of the preacher&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing, as much as your own). The process will probably work best if you try it on a new moon, or a full moon, or Friday the 13th, or Halloween&amp;hellip; the actual day is less important than the psychological effect it has on you. As long as you don&amp;rsquo;t try it on Christmas Eve or something stupid like that, you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important, though. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to start or end your ritual at exactly 12:00:00am Greenwich Mean Time or anything, but as a general rule of thumb, you ought to show up a bit before midnight and have everything set up by no later than ten or fifteen after. Show up a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; before midnight if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how you&amp;rsquo;re going to get in. Shockingly enough, most houses of God do tend to lock their doors at night, at least if no one&amp;rsquo;s there to watch over them (and remember, we want &lt;em&gt;empty&lt;/em&gt;, got it?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, certain things you must bring and certain things you can&amp;rsquo;t bring. For this ritual, you will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A full can of salt&amp;mdash;you won&amp;rsquo;t use all of it, but it&amp;rsquo;s always better to have more than you need than to have less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seven candles, red or white being preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something to light the candles with. You would be shocked how often people forget this. Occult ritual or not, they aren&amp;rsquo;t going to magically light themselves!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A length of red string, rope, yarn, or thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A full-length floor or wall mirror. Ideally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to find one of these already present in the church (they&amp;rsquo;re a bit unwieldy to be lugging around with you during a break-in). However, if there really aren&amp;rsquo;t any there, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to bring your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also find it useful to bring some markers, pencils, paper, a flashlight, and any sort of tools that might be necessary to secure your entrance into the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will NOT be permitted to bring in any electronic or timekeeping devices. This includes all cell phones, smartphones, tablets, eReaders, mp3 players, PDAs, calculators, wristwatches, pocket watches, kitchen timers, hourglasses, etc, etc, etc. (seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s worse than the SAT). If you&amp;rsquo;re one of those people that has your smartphone practically wired into your brain, don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;you can bring those with you to the church as long as you leave them &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the room in which you will be doing the ritual. If you brought a flashlight (helpful for finding your way around without attracting unwanted attention), leave that outside too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;rsquo;t bring in any sort of religious paraphernalia to protect you, especially if it pertains to the Abrahamic religions (and yes, if those goth-y black cross earrings you&amp;rsquo;re wearing are hanging right-side up, they count). If you have any kind of holy symbols like that with you, the Devil will simply refuse to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you&amp;rsquo;re not going in totally unprotected. In fact, most of your supplies are not for any sort of Devil-summoning ritual, but your own protection&amp;mdash;old superstitions and folk magic remedies to guard oneself from evil. From what I know of it, the effect&amp;rsquo;s mostly based on the power of belief, so there are probably numerous other objects, artifacts, and procedures that would work just as well. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to risk being left helpless at the mercy of the Devil in order to test that theory, feel free to experiment! However, for anyone without a psychotic death wish, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend sticking to the ritual as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;re sure you have all the right supplies with you, make your way into the church and find someplace to set up. It can be anywhere, from the main sanctuary where services are held, to a Sunday school classroom, to a walk-in supply closet&amp;mdash;as long as you have a sufficient amount of open floor space and are certain not to be disturbed. Set up your mirror first; this is where the Devil will appear when you summon him. As such, you mustn&amp;rsquo;t complete the summoning until you&amp;rsquo;ve laid down certain wards around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, surround the mirror with an unbroken circle of salt. If it is hanging on a wall or door, lay down a semicircle around it instead, making sure that the salt touches the wall at both ends. Then wrap your red string around the mirror several times. The color red, especially red string, is symbolic of protection in the folklore of many cultures and religions. This is also why red candles are a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the candles, set them up around the outside of your circle (or semicircle) of salt, spaced at relatively even intervals. No, you do not have to get out measuring tape and align them perfectly, but do at least try to make it look as though it was set up by someone old enough to be trusted with matches. Light the candles in a clockwise fashion, being careful not to disturb the salt&amp;mdash;if you break the circle, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to start all over again. Once all of the candles are lit and burning strongly, your protective wards are complete. You are now ready to proceed to the actual summoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, you must first get the Devil&amp;rsquo;s attention and demonstrate your resolve by performing some sort of sacrilegious act in the holy space. Turning a crucifix or cross upside-down is fairly conventional, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the only option. For example, I know of a kid who once fulfilled this requirement by scribbling obnoxious graffiti all over a painting of Jesus hanging in his Sunday school classroom. The nice thing about turning a cross upside-down is that once you&amp;rsquo;ve finished your encounter&amp;mdash;assuming you&amp;rsquo;ve survived it in one piece&amp;mdash;you can just flip it right-side-up again and no one&amp;rsquo;s the wiser&amp;hellip; sidestepping the relatively minor but still irritating risk of having your Sunday school turn into a re-enactment of the Spanish Inquisition for the next month and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve finished doing whatever offensive thing you decide on, shut all doors to the room and turn off all of the lights, so that the space is lit only by the candles. Face the mirror and stare deeply into it, concentrating on your desired outcome. There are no incantations, no arcane strings of Latin you have to recite. Just look into the mirror and wish as hard as you can for the Devil to appear there. After a few moments of this, when you feel ready, close your eyes and count to ten. Then open them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all has gone correctly, you will no longer see your own reflection. You will be looking at the Devil&amp;hellip; or at least, the way the Devil has chosen to appear to you. Chances are, he won&amp;rsquo;t look like your conventional red, horned demon with goat legs and a pitchfork, nor any other sort of terrible apparition. No point in scaring you off now&amp;hellip; better to lure you in, make you feel safe. To that end, he generally takes on the appearance of a fairly average, nondescript human being. If anything, he&amp;rsquo;s prone to vanity and will lean towards the more attractive end of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only really frightening part of him will be his eyes. No matter how hard he tries, he can&amp;rsquo;t hide the sinister gleam smoldering deep within them, the malevolent amusement and hunger, like the eyes of a spider contemplating a fly struggling in its web. They&amp;rsquo;re supremely confident, those eyes&amp;hellip; and without pity. Don&amp;rsquo;t look into them too deeply, or you&amp;rsquo;ll begin to feel helpless and paralyzed with dread, losing your hope and will to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you&amp;rsquo;ll probably just be standing there staring at him in shock for a few moments (having on some level expected for the ritual to fail), he&amp;rsquo;ll initiate the conversation by asking you what it is you desire from him. If you can gather your wits enough to string together a coherent sentence, you should respond with something like: &amp;ldquo;I wish to challenge you in a game of question-and-response.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t get the words exactly right, he&amp;rsquo;ll know what you mean, and he&amp;rsquo;ll accept your request with a wide, predatory grin of anticipation. He&amp;rsquo;s been playing this game for a long time, you see, and he&amp;rsquo;s very good at it. Most humans, on the other hand, are not. This gives him a chance to, at the very least, thoroughly mess with your mind, and at most&amp;hellip; well, we&amp;rsquo;ll save that for the &amp;ldquo;litany of shit that could go wrong&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to play it very smart to avoid justifying his expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general rules to the game are very simple, with a few caveats that can make things more complicated. He&amp;rsquo;ll begin by asking you a question (he always initiates the game). It can be anything, from a piece of obscure trivia, to a riddle, to an extremely personal inquiry. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry; you won&amp;rsquo;t be immediately plunged into Hell if you say the wrong answer or anything like that. As a matter of fact, he won&amp;rsquo;t even tell you whether you got the answer right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve answered his question, you get to ask him one in return. Now, here&amp;rsquo;s where the consequences of your response come in. If you answered his last question correctly, he will respond to your question as honestly and accurately as he is able. However, if you answered it incorrectly, he is free to lie to you as he sees fit. Perhaps if you&amp;rsquo;ve asked him something you&amp;rsquo;re better off not knowing, he&amp;rsquo;ll tell you the truth about it anyway. More likely, he&amp;rsquo;ll feed you the most insidious, damaging lie he can come up with. Either way, after he&amp;rsquo;s responded, he&amp;rsquo;ll ask you another question, and the process will repeat over and over again until you decide to call it quits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may be sitting there thinking that it sounds fairly easy to get the information you need&amp;hellip; all you have to do is wait for a question you can answer correctly, and then take that opportunity to ask him what you really want to know, ignoring everything else he&amp;rsquo;s said. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Devil will never give you an easy question, one that you can be completely sure of the answer to. He may instead ask questions that you have some vague knowledge of, that you think you &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; know the answer to but aren&amp;rsquo;t really confident&amp;hellip; thus forcing you to endlessly second-guess yourself, obsessing over whether or not you can trust the information he gives you next. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll think that what he said was a lie, &lt;em&gt;wish&lt;/em&gt; it was a lie, but be eternally consumed by doubt, unable to fully convince yourself that you were wrong. Or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll have to make a huge choice based on the information that he gives you, and be tormented by fear and indecisiveness as you realize that your fate (and perhaps the fate of others, as well) rests entirely upon whether or not you were able to correctly recall some arcane piece of trivia that you don&amp;rsquo;t even remember now. You&amp;rsquo;ll never remember the exact questions the Devil asked you, by the way; that would make it too easy for you to go back and check your responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe, instead of testing your knowledge, he&amp;rsquo;ll ask you something personal, something you lie to even yourself about. You&amp;rsquo;ll answer back to him, thinking you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten the question correct (&amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t resent my sister!&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Yes, I would turn the money in to the police!&amp;rdquo;)&amp;mdash;but he&amp;rsquo;ll know better than you do that you&amp;rsquo;re lying, and he&amp;rsquo;ll lie to you in return. And you&amp;rsquo;ll believe him. You&amp;rsquo;ll believe him until you are no longer able to deceive yourself, and by then, it might be too late&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe&amp;hellip; maybe he won&amp;rsquo;t even give you a chance to get an accurate response at all. Maybe he&amp;rsquo;ll just ask you endless strings of completely impossible questions, making you more and more frustrated and disheartened as you realize you&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to force him to tell you the truth. Questions like: &amp;ldquo;What was the exact height of Mount Everest in centimeters in the year 1666?&amp;rdquo; or, &amp;ldquo;What is the air-speed-velocity of an un-laden swallow?&amp;rdquo;. Although, knowing his sense of humor, if he ever asked the latter, he might consider &amp;ldquo;African or European?&amp;rdquo; a correct response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a couple of ways to short-circuit this particular strategy, however&amp;mdash;additional rules and courses of action that make the game more interesting and prevent you from being stonewalled completely. In all honesty, though, he probably would prefer for you to try one of these options anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is to ask him a riddle instead of a question. If you somehow manage to stump him, and he answers the riddle wrong or gives up, he&amp;rsquo;ll be obligated to give you a truthful response to your next question. If he answers the riddle correctly&amp;mdash;once again, don&amp;rsquo;t worry. He won&amp;rsquo;t pounce on you like a sphinx or drag you into Hell. What &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; happen is that he will get a &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo;, allowing him to lie in response to one question he would otherwise be obligated to answer truthfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, if he gets a pass, you might as well just give up and quit the game right there. It&amp;rsquo;s nearly impossible to determine when he&amp;rsquo;s telling you the truth under the best of conditions. Adding another layer of complexity by constantly trying to figure out when and if he&amp;rsquo;s used his pass&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s about enough to make any normal person&amp;rsquo;s brain explode. There&amp;rsquo;s no way. Just forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is for you to take a &amp;ldquo;dare&amp;rdquo; from him. If you accept it and vow to follow through, then once again, he&amp;rsquo;ll have to answer your next question truthfully. If you choose instead to reject it, he&amp;rsquo;ll get another &amp;ldquo;pass&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before you freak out and reject that whole idea completely, you should know that he won&amp;rsquo;t ask you to do anything overly dramatic or unspeakably evil, like blow up a hospital or murder somebody. As a rule of thumb, most dares won&amp;rsquo;t involve direct loss of life or any major felonies. However, they certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. Inflicting severe pain on yourself, doing something that terrifies the shit out of you&amp;hellip; cutting off a treasured relationship, publicly humiliating yourself or someone you love&amp;hellip; all of these things and more, things you might not even be able to imagine, are completely on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to go that far, to put yourself in that kind of position&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;ll get your answer. However, if he manages to come up with the one thing you know you simply can&amp;rsquo;t or won&amp;rsquo;t do&amp;hellip; well, then once again, you might as well just quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing&amp;mdash;DON&amp;rsquo;T think you can just tell him you&amp;rsquo;re going to do something and then not do it. If you accept a dare and don&amp;rsquo;t follow through with it&amp;hellip; well, let&amp;rsquo;s just say there will be consequences. Just suck it up and keep your promise, no matter WHAT it was. Trust me, you&amp;rsquo;re better off that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you&amp;rsquo;ve either gotten the information you wanted or given up on it completely, you may end the ritual by simply thanking the Devil for accepting your request, bowing politely at the waist, and bidding him farewell. The surface of the mirror will seem to swim and flicker for a moment, and then you will be looking at your own reflection again. Only when you are absolutely certain that you&amp;rsquo;re looking into your own two eyes may you turn away from the mirror, flick the lights back on, and begin dismantling your protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now&amp;mdash;and this is important&amp;mdash;even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten the information that you wanted, you MUST end the ritual in this manner before 66 minutes have elapsed. Well, I suppose that technically you have 66 minutes and 6 seconds (subtle, right?), but if you&amp;rsquo;re seriously going to try to cut it that close without any kind of timekeeping device, you&amp;rsquo;re probably screwed anyway. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that you keep to this time limit. I&amp;rsquo;ll save the reason behind it for the end, but don&amp;rsquo;t skip ahead&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve still got a few important tips on how to play:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be very careful what sort of personal information you give out. Try not to talk about yourself, especially your emotions and problems, any more than absolutely necessary. This guy knows human psychology like the back of his hand, and he &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get inside of your head. It&amp;rsquo;s like talking to Hannibal Lecter. Give him enough to work with and, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t believe a single word he says, he will still find ways to fuck with your mind like nobody&amp;rsquo;s business. If anything he asks makes you even remotely uncomfortable, do not hesitate to lie through your teeth. There can be plenty of other questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a similar note, try to keep the game on track and moving briskly. Unstructured interactions of any kind are to be avoided. Chances are that at some point, he will try to draw you off on a tangent&amp;mdash;discussing something that fascinates you, analyzing a response you&amp;rsquo;ve given him, or finding some other excuse to speak at length without moving the game forward. This is not only a waste of valuable time, but also another excellent opportunity to mess with your mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you choose to give him a riddle, use one you&amp;rsquo;ve made up yourself. If your riddle has ever been written down anywhere at all, from the pages of &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; to some long-lost tome of ancient magic, he will already know the answer. That said, it still has to be a &lt;em&gt;legitimate&lt;/em&gt; riddle, with an answer that makes logical sense from some angle. You can&amp;rsquo;t just ask something like &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s green, has ten legs, and hops?&amp;rdquo;, then claim for some inexplicable reason that the answer was &amp;ldquo;marshmallows&amp;rdquo;. Nor can you ask him a straight question like &amp;ldquo;What have I got in my pocket?&amp;rdquo; (he probably knows that, anyway). There are no hard-and-fast rules to determine whether a riddle makes sense or not, but you&amp;rsquo;re a reasonable human being. Your ancestors ate from the Tree of Knowledge. Please, for the love of crap, use common sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you choose to take a dare, there is a slight chance that the Devil will ask you to do something seemingly easy&amp;hellip; deliver a letter, for instance, or scribble a ten-digit number on a public restroom stall. If he does ask you for something like this, and you have even a shred of common decency in you, do NOT accept. Chances are that he&amp;rsquo;s using you to further some sinister plot, one liable to ruin a lot of lives and harm a lot of people. Who knows, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re the type of person who really doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind throwing an unknown number of total strangers under a bus to find out what you want to know&amp;hellip; but at least be aware that that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, be very aware of the time. It might be helpful to do some practicing beforehand and get a feel for how long an hour is without a watch. The Devil will probably put off discussing the things you&amp;rsquo;re most keen to find out for as long as he can; and as you near the 66 minute deadline, he&amp;rsquo;ll start trying harder and harder to distract you, captivate you, and otherwise keep you playing until it&amp;rsquo;s too late. He&amp;rsquo;ll string you along, feed you little glimmers of false hope, keep you thinking: &amp;ldquo;Just a few more minutes&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m almost there!&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t fall for it. Don&amp;rsquo;t go over the time limit. No matter what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might be thinking that this game really doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound all that dangerous so far&amp;hellip; threats of psychological damage rarely seem to carry the same weight as threats of physical harm, even though their costs are often just as great. Hate to burst your bubble, but the game is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; from safe. There are plenty of ways for you to seriously screw yourself over both physically and mentally (not to mention spiritually). And it is with these that I will conclude, in the vain hope that they may make some sort of impression&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, while you are speaking with the Devil, do NOT let him out of your sight. Keep staring into the mirror no matter what happens. He will undoubtedly try various tricks to make you look away. You will hear noises behind you, feel eyes on the back of your neck, see shadowy phantoms writhing in the depths of the mirror. A cold breath will blow upon you from behind, smelling like the crypt. A deep silence will settle, only to be interrupted by a loud SMACK directly behind your head, giving you about the worst jumpscare you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. Hell, the Devil may even abandon a measure of his own dignified façade and give a sudden jump of feigned shock, shouting loudly and pointing behind you with a very convincing look of terror on his face. Whatever he might test you with, you must not look away from him. If you look away, if you lose sight of him completely&amp;mdash;even for one second&amp;mdash;you will look back at the mirror to find him gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not gone. Out of the mirror. In the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how much of your body the police will find the next morning and what state it&amp;rsquo;s in will depend entirely on the sort of mood he&amp;rsquo;s in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing will occur if you break any of the protections laid down before beginning the ritual. Interrupting the circle of salt, letting the red string unwind, knocking over a candle or letting one go out&amp;hellip; any of these things will free him from the mirror, and then&amp;mdash;well, you&amp;rsquo;re all a bunch of creative horror junkies. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a different topic, you may reach a point in the game (probably after a long series of maddeningly impossible questions) where the Devil asks you the deceptively simple question, &amp;ldquo;What is your full name?&amp;rdquo;. You MUST NOT give it to him. Names can be things of great power. Although the Devil will, of course, already know your name, telling it to him yourself is akin to inviting a vampire into your home. Your name is deeply synonymous with your own, inner self; thus, giving him your name is powerfully symbolic of giving him your self. If you are foolish enough to make this mistake, all of your protections will be for naught, and he will seize upon your unwitting offer with malicious glee, stealing away your soul and dragging it back with him into Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least this way, the police will find a complete, identifiable body. As a matter of fact, your vacant shell will be totally unblemished, seemingly having dropped dead of sheer terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s the matter of what happens if you go over the time limit. This is arguably the worst thing you can do. You won&amp;rsquo;t think so at first&amp;hellip; the Devil will give you no indication that you&amp;rsquo;ve exceeded the boundary, and you will conclude the ritual as if nothing had gone wrong. Perhaps, as the Devil&amp;rsquo;s image in the mirror trembles and gives way, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a particularly nasty, triumphant smirk flash across his face, but this will be easily dismissed as your imagination. You&amp;rsquo;ll turn the lights back on, gather your belongings, and go to leave the room. But when you open the door, you will see&amp;hellip; nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, nothing. Just a flat, white void extending infinitely in all directions. Only the room which was reflected in the mirror will now exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, if you turn back around to face the mirror again, you may catch a last glimpse of your own reflection. Perhaps it will even turn and favor you with a smirk and a cheeky wave before stepping out the door into the perfectly normal church hallway. As you may have already figured out, you yourself are no longer in the church at this point. Your soul is now trapped in the mirror, and the Devil has taken the liberty of possessing your body, now that you are no longer using it. Pound on the glass and scream all you like; you&amp;rsquo;ll never get out on your own, and no exorcist can help you. But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s not like you&amp;rsquo;re in Hell, right? At least, not necessarily&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have to understand, see, is that a human soul stripped bare of its flesh is a deeply volatile and vulnerable thing, especially when trapped in the land of the living. You are now an entity of purely mental properties, and as such, the barriers between what is real to you and what is imaginary have been completely dissolved. As you fill that reflected room with your anger, your sorrow, your fear at being trapped, these emotions will begin to coalesce, given form by your mind. If you&amp;rsquo;re not particularly imaginative, these creatures may not be too terrible, may not be able to inflict too much horror and pain. With time, you may even be able to teach yourself to get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, yours is a mind haunted by monsters&amp;hellip;a mind that is vibrantly creative and imaginative and more than usually twisted&amp;hellip; well, there&amp;rsquo;s no telling what horrors might come clawing their way out of the maelstrom, tasting sweet release from the confines of your subconscious, hungering for your terror and suffering. They will refuse to be banished, dragging you kicking and screaming into an endless positive feedback loop of pain and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, if you&amp;rsquo;re a regular patron of websites like this one, you&amp;rsquo;re probably pretty well fucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find release from the mirror and the world that you&amp;rsquo;ve created therein. They say that if you call to the Devil once more and ask him to free you, he&amp;rsquo;ll be willing to take you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the usual fee, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows, maybe if your imagination is twisted and powerful enough to create a personal Hell that leaves you begging for the real thing, those talents might be put to good use. There are over seven billion people in the world, after all; even the Devil himself can&amp;rsquo;t be messing with all of their minds at once. Talented help is always appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the corollary to being trapped inside the mirror is that the Devil now gets to do whatever he wants in your body until sunrise. At around that time, your body will mercifully drop dead from the strain of the possession; an autopsy will probably identify the cause as some kind of coronary event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get too relieved, though; he&amp;rsquo;s perfectly capable of stirring up plenty of trouble in those few hours. For instance, he may decide to do something big and dramatic, like purchase a large meat cleaver and go on a murder spree, starting with the names in your address book and working his way down to complete strangers if he has time. Or perhaps he&amp;rsquo;ll focus on only one person, someone who trusts you completely, using your persona to get him or her alone and vulnerable, and then&amp;hellip; well, no need to describe it here. Once again, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can think of a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting to see why I called this the worst outcome yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also a chance that he won&amp;rsquo;t lay a finger on any of your loved ones, instead deciding to do something a little more subtle&amp;hellip; more insidious. Like dropping off a few nondescript, unmarked packages on certain doorsteps in the dangerous part of town. Or locating a particular dusty, age-yellowed text in the storeroom of your local library and intentionally misfiling it in the Young Adult Literature section. Or whispering seven very choice words into the ear of the distracted-looking young redhead waiting for the 3am subway train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe he&amp;rsquo;ll decide that, in this age of waning superstition, not enough people are getting interested in his games, and the knowledge of them is in danger of being lost. Maybe he&amp;rsquo;ll decide he needs to get the word out a bit more, do a bit of networking, attract some new suckers&amp;hellip; ahem, &amp;ldquo;challengers&amp;rdquo;. Maybe he&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick peek at your browser history, see where the impressionable, curious minds are hanging out these days. Maybe he&amp;rsquo;ll even write a quick tutorial, in modern parlance rather than some inscrutable, obsolete demonological text&amp;hellip; post it on the Internet and see how many bites he gets&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haha, maybe I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have gone there. But if you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far without shying, a little twist at the end isn&amp;rsquo;t going to put you off, is it, dear reader? I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are plenty of intrepid adventurers among you with burning questions you&amp;rsquo;d like answered. And you&amp;rsquo;re all a smart bunch. You know the pitfalls, the conventions; you live and breathe this sort of thing, do you not? There&amp;rsquo;s no way &lt;em&gt;you&amp;rsquo;d&lt;/em&gt; fall into any of the obvious traps, right? You&amp;rsquo;re not some Dick or Jane off the street, after all. You&amp;rsquo;d be bringing a whole new level of competition. You would&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, excuse me just a moment, I think I hear someone calling for me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What? You want out that badly ALREADY? Must be one Hell of an imagination you&amp;rsquo;ve got on you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t sleep with my window open anymore. No matter how hot outside it gets, that bastard stays closed. It&amp;rsquo;s been this way for a long time. Since I was very young. It&amp;rsquo;s not a real hit with the ladies during summertime. People usually recommend air conditioners, and I usually go with the prospect when I have company. But when it&amp;rsquo;s in, I don&amp;rsquo;t sleep well at all because I can only imagine how easy it would be for anyone to bypass them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a single perk to an AC though, well, besides the relief from the hot stickiness of the summer&amp;rsquo;s humidity, and that&amp;rsquo;s the steady hum which stifles the silence. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the silence you see. There was a time when it brought me an almost zen like level of peace and tranquility, but now, I find it invasive, dangerous. Silence never comes alone. From time to time, I can still hear the chanting, from my youth, I can hear them all, wordlessly and yet with prestigious synchronicity and harmony with one another, their conjoined voices echo out from the woods like the gentle and yet threatening breeze that proceeds a violent hailstorm, rhythmic yet senseless. It never went away, and yet I know they&amp;rsquo;ve all moved on or died. I know this is all very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was about nine years old, my dad and I lived in this old rented two family apartment house in a town called Bridgewater in the state of Massachusetts. We lived on the bottom floor, The second floor wasn&amp;rsquo;t used. It was recently vacated by its prior residents. It was a very quiet neighborhood, very suburban and with plenty of woods. Behind our house, there was a backyard that proceeded into a large forest that spanned for miles out. I used to play in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad and my mother were recently divorced, so there were just the three of us living here. Me, him and the dog Cash, who was named after the late country singer Johnny Cash. He was an old Scottish Terrier. You know the type, ankle biters with the really ugly bearded faces. They got him as a pup when I was still in diapers and he was my lifelong friend. He may have been something of an idiot, but at the time, he was all I had. I cried and cried when mom tried to take him. In the end, he was left in my father&amp;rsquo;s care for my sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash and I would spend a lot of time playing in the woods. When you&amp;rsquo;re young, your imagination is a very powerful thing, and the woods had an almost magic quality in terms of supplementation for my imagination. I would play army, Build forts, climb trees. One time me and Cash traveled in so far, I actually got lost. We were losing daylight as it was October and the light was fading at a much faster rate, I began to panic, afraid I&amp;rsquo;d be trapped out here in the pitch black. As we walked around, frantic for landmarks, anything familiar, That&amp;rsquo;s when I saw it. The clearing, with a large rock in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly uncommon to see graffiti and vandalism in the woods. A public forest is known quite well for trees with messages carved into them, names, swastikas, brad and Jen 4ever in a nice cute heart. Stuff like that, not to mention the pseudo gang names spray painted on rocks. That was the impression I got of this place, a hangout for older kids. But something wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. Me being only 9, my mind wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly capable of comprehending the connotations of symbols and other things, and yet there was something really off about these images. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anything like them before. The surrounding trees had crudely shaped images of what appeared to be a goat man hybrid, like a stick figure, with an unnecessarily detailed goat&amp;rsquo;s head imposed over where you&amp;rsquo;d expect to see a very basic stick figure face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These images were drawn over and over and over again, all over the trees that surrounded the clearing, almost obsessively so, and not just at the basic human height level, but all up the trees, as if whoever carved them, had to use a ladder. The rock itself had red markings all over it, letters that I have never seen before. Underneath though, was written in black spray paint a message I actually could read. It said: &amp;ldquo;Behold the wisdom of the Horned&amp;rdquo; , and below that, there were five painted lines. They were all the same height except for the two outer lines that were twice the height and spiraled outwards at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really scared me about this place though were the dolls. They were hanging from the branches around the clearing. They appeared to have been woven out of sticks, and poorly so. Taking a closer look, I realized what was so scary about them. While the stick dolls were clearly constructed with the grace of shitty arts and crafts students, the heads of them were dry and clean skulls of animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what of, but they were bleached white, dry and clean, and their hollow sockets&amp;hellip;I can&amp;rsquo;t explain it effectively without sounding insane, but there was something sentient about them, watchful, and pleading. I could feel their eyes on me, though they had none to watch with. I felt fear, not my own fear, mind you, but something, an aura of emotion that made absolutely no sense. Have you ever been at an underage drinking party that got crashed by the police? It&amp;rsquo;s that kind of fear. The fear that comes synonymously with trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t explain why I did it, but I reached up and touched one. Maybe it was a child&amp;rsquo;s general inquisitive nature that compelled me, maybe it was fascination, or an intense desire to quell my fear and convince myself that they were just dolls and not the watchful spirits I would eventually come to believe they were. When I touched it, the skull fell off. The doll unwound itself. Only a piece of it remained attached to the rawhide rope that it was suspended from. The skull cracked when it hit the ground. When it happened, there was a certainty that quelled inside me. As Naïve as a nine year old could be, there was also a certainty that remained with me to this day. I don&amp;rsquo;t belong here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash immediately started barking when the doll fell, and it startled me so effectively that I let out a scream. I looked up, the sky was glowing red with the darkness not too far behind. The sun was going down, and I had to get out of here. Cash was staring at me, black eyes wide open and tail wagging violently. He was barking at me, insistently. He began to growl at something, maybe air, maybe ghosts. When I approached him, he turned and ran. Cash was my only companion in this unnatural place, and I would have been damned if I was going to let him betray me to solitude here, so I gave chase. I ran for my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I saw before I chased Cash, was something that really messed with me. All the other dolls that were hanging, when I first arrived, they were dangling, some even spinning lazily in the breeze, and yet as I ran after Cash, I saw every single doll on the sight were completely stationary, staring and facing me directly. I was dismissive of this detail as I was more afraid of being alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never let Cash out of my sight. He led me straight home. I never loved my dog more than when I realized what he had done for me. Dogs are never lost, they always know the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I went to bed, I told my dad what I saw. He laughed it off and told me it was just teenagers being punks, and that I should just let it go. I found it comforting and was almost willing to let it go. I even fell asleep without any trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night was when I heard it for the first time. The noise that&amp;rsquo;d haunt me to this very day. I woke up and could hear noise coming through my window. I got up and looked out to listen closer. That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized it was chanting. Voices, dozens maybe. They were coming from in the woods. I could hear them, loudly and rhythmically. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what they were saying, but I could tell it was ceremonious, like a hymn you hear people sing in churches, except it felt dark, violent even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately thought about the clearing with the rock. The dolls. The fear. I knew in my bones that the chanting was coming from there. What scared me the most was that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t far. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t far at all. The Chanting went on for hours. I just lied there in bed, wide eyed with fear listening to it, praying that it&amp;rsquo;d stop. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t though. It went on until four in the morning when the early birds began to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped playing in the woods. My dad noticed the behavior immediately and asked if I was alright. I told him about the chanting and again he shrugged his shoulders and said that it was probably teenagers drinking beers and having a party. I asked them why they&amp;rsquo;d drink beer and chant the same sound for five hours. He told me they weren&amp;rsquo;t chanting, that I imagined it, and that I should close the window from now on. I probably should of listened to him, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. Curiosity got the better of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next night, the chanting began again at exactly eleven o&amp;rsquo;clock. It seemed louder than before. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep hearing it, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to close the window. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I thought this way, probably because I was just a child. I dimwittedly thought at the time that if I closed my window, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to hear them coming if they decided to break into the house. The logic is flawed I know, that they would still be chanting as they emerge from the woods and cross my yard, and not be nice and quiet about it, but that&amp;rsquo;s how I thought back then. That&amp;rsquo;s why I couldn&amp;rsquo;t close the window, because I had to know if they were coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This went on for several days. Every night, from eleven to four, exactly on the dot. Sometimes I could see in the woods, way way way out there, a faint glow, like the light of a fire. But it was so faint and far in between that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know whether to acknowledge or dismiss it as a trick of my own eyes. Other times, I would successfully fall asleep due to exhaustion, only to wake up several hours later in panic, still able to hear it. I asked my dad if Cash could sleep in my room on the third night, and he said it&amp;rsquo;d be fine. It felt better knowing I had the dog to keep me company while I would hear the noise. And better yet, if I could hear them coming, he would too and then be a dog about it and start barking out the window at them. I anticipated a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep and even felt silly for not thinking about this solution earlier. I fell asleep at eight with Cash sleeping at the foot of my bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up at quarter past eleven, to Cash barking. He was on his two hind legs, tail wagging spastically, and he was barking out the window, ears pointing up. Barking, growling, howling out the window. I immediately got out of bed and looked out the window towards the woods. Nothing. Nothing at all. Cash was very agitated, growling and looking at me, then back out the window and barking. The chanting was still going on, same as the last couple of days. I remember feeling uncomfortable that Cash was barking at the noise, that if he was in danger of getting their attention. I tried to calm him down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when my dad came in, he stumbled in groggily and picked up the dog and turned to walk out the door with him, mumbling about him shutting the hell up. I called his name, but he was so asleep, he was practically dead on his feat. I screamed at him, &amp;ldquo;DAD, THE WOODS!&amp;rdquo; That got his attention. He turned around and walked up to me, looked out the window and then back at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This again?&amp;rdquo; he mumbled, &amp;ldquo;Look boy, it&amp;rsquo;s just your imagination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No listen, that&amp;rsquo;s what Cash was going crazy about, there are people singing in the woods! Just listen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked carefully out the window. Cash was growling in his arms as his head turned out the window. I listened too, but there was nothing. No sound. Total silence. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it, could this had been a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad told me to go to sleep and left the room, mumbling insults at Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silence chilled me far more than then the chanting ever did. At least when they were singing their malicious hymns, there was at least a sense of distance between them and me, but right now, I know they&amp;rsquo;re out there, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know where. I had no bearings whatsoever. What was even worse, what wrought unprecedented terror upon me was that there was no nighttime ambiance in those woods. No crickets. Evenings brought them out in droves this time of year, and even when they were chanting I could still hear them&amp;hellip;but now it was quieter than a bone chilling winter night. Pure silence. How long did I stare out the window at those woods across my backyard, I have no idea. But when I woke up the next day, I was still sitting in the chair I planted right by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That morning over breakfast, I insisted that there really was chanting out there, but my dad wasn&amp;rsquo;t hearing any of it. He put his foot down and told me that he won&amp;rsquo;t hear any more of this, that I need to grow up and take responsibility and stop being so afraid all the time. You know, typical tough guy dad shit. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother to bring up the lack of crickets, knowing full well that he&amp;rsquo;d have made up an explanation for that as well. So I kept quiet, and ate my breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day, I was waiting for my mom to pick me up at the end of my dad&amp;rsquo;s driveway to bring me to my grandma&amp;rsquo;s house where she was currently living, it was Friday and My mom had me on weekends. As I was waiting, a large black pickup truck was passed by the house very slowly. It came to a stop right in front me. There were two men in the truck, older, about my dad&amp;rsquo;s age. At first I thought maybe they were friends of his, but this thought didn&amp;rsquo;t last. The driver rolled down his window and looked at me, he was bald and was wearing abnormally slim sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was smoking a thin cigar or a cigarillo, I remember the strong smell of it. He looked at me, as if he were sizing me up, investigating for a moment until finally he smiled at me reached over and hit his friend on the shoulder and pointed me out to him. He too was bald and wearing the same sunglasses. They said something to each other and then the driver looked back at me with a terrible smile and drove away, waving slowly at me as he did so. They passed me by three more times before my mom finally picked me up. I didn&amp;rsquo;t give those two any thought, and just took comfort in the thought that I&amp;rsquo;d be sleeping somewhere else for the next couple of nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend went by without a hitch, and sleeping over grandma&amp;rsquo;s house was such a relief. When I told her and mom about the voices in the woods, they just looked at each other and told me to tell dad about it. Frustrated, I argued that I did, but it was pointless. She too used the &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just your imagination&amp;rdquo; crap, same as Dad. Not once during the whole experience did the memory leave my mind, of the two men in the truck or the distant chanting. Soon enough I would have to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday night came along and I was dropped back off at my dad&amp;rsquo;s house, where I would spend the whole day dreading the inevitable nightfall, dreading the answer of whether or not I would hear the chanting in the woods, hear the strange people sing their dark songs in unison. I begged my dad to let me keep Cash in the room with me tonight, but he said no, leaving me to face what happened next alone. So, come bed time, I was sitting on my chair, by the window, staring into the darkness until the hour came, I stayed up until eleven, expecting to hear it, but what I got was silence. No singing. No crickets either. Just pure silence. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell if I was relieved or terrified, maybe they all moved on. Maybe they went somewhere else to play their creepy games. It took some self convincing, but I managed to calm myself to such a state of mind where I could actually go to sleep, knowing that I was safe. Reluctantly I crawled into my bed and closed my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up to the most bone chillingly fucked up thing I had ever seen. It was surreal, the fucking image of it, every time I sleep&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brain immediately surged itself into full function, beyond consciousness and straight into full fledged fight or flight mode as a cold rough hand forced its way over my mouth and shoved my face into my own mattress. I felt a body much larger than mine bare down on me. I felt the jagged kneecap ram itself directly into my stomach as I was then Pulled out of my bed and wrestled into a standing position, the cold hand still holding my mouth shut, another hand wedging my left hand directly behind my back and pulling upwards until the pain became so unbearable, I thought my arm was going to come off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;SHHH!&amp;rdquo; a voice whispered into my ear. His breath was ice cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; said another voice across the room. My eyes were well adjusted to the darkness as it was, and I could see, through the moonlight shining into my now opened window a man wearing a horrible horrible mask. At first I thought he had the head of a goat, but I knew better. The goat stared with lifeless marbles where its eyes should have been, its head was a mask made out of the severed head of a goat, or a ram, not properly stuffed, and half rotted. It&amp;rsquo;s horns curled into spirals jutting out of its head, and random patches of the fur were missing, simply to show raw blistering skin. I tried to scream but the hand over my mouth tightened its grip, my arm behind my back, pulled to near breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Scream, and we will kill you,&amp;rdquo; the voice whispered into my ear. My eyes couldn&amp;rsquo;t, no, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t break away from that horrible person wearing the severed goats head as a mask. He was shirtless, wearing a necklace of what appeared to be bones, he was horribly emaciated and there were markings all up and down his torso. In his right hand he held a knife about the size of my forearm. It&amp;rsquo;s build wasn&amp;rsquo;t like any knife I had ever seen. It took a step closer to me and pressed it up against my throat, the steel was bitterly cold, and the tip of the blade was sharper than anything I ever felt. It would take less than four ounces of pressure to open my throat it, and they knew that I knew it. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t cry, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even breath. In its other hand, it held a basic candle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tomorrow,&amp;rdquo; the thing said, his voice muffled by the lifeless dead goat mask, &amp;ldquo;you will exit your house at midnight, you will light this candle, place it on the ground in the center of your yard, and you will sit behind it, legs crossed, right foot on top of your left knee, and vice versa,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t do this,&amp;rdquo; the voice whispered into my ear, &amp;ldquo;the blood of your loved ones will be on your hands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goat man quickly retreated the blade from my neck. I don&amp;rsquo;t know remember what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember waking up in my bed, panting and crying. My dad came in to see what was wrong with me, and when I told him, he told me it was just a nightmare.  At this point, he sat down at the end of my bed, he looked very wary, like he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to say what he was about to say. He rubbed his eyes with his fists and wearily explained to me that this was all just me stressing out over the divorce, that maybe we should look into talking to a therapist about these voices and hallucinations I&amp;rsquo;ve been having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling so betrayed, so alone by the unfairness of that. I argued with him that everything I was seeing and hearing was true, but it was too late. He and mom talked it out, my behavior, my claims. They think I was losing my shit over the divorce. Their minds were made up, nothing I was going to say would have convinced them otherwise. And of course, in hindsight it only made perfect sense. Who would believe a nine year old when they say that they&amp;rsquo;re were voices&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was silent the whole day. Cash sat with me in my room as I wasted the daylight playing video games. I didn&amp;rsquo;t speak to my old man not once. I could see the weary looks on his face when he&amp;rsquo;d walk by my room, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to press the issue. He looked just as defeated as I did. He spent most of his time on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until later that day, I found myself recalling what the goat thing said to me before everything went dark. That I had to light a candle at midnight. But when I woke up that morning, there was nothing in my room. There was a sudden sense of hope, because when I searched around my room, trying to find his candle, it was nowhere to be found. Never, even to this day, have I searched so hard for something only to be frantically pleased by the end results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was gone. Have I been alleviated from the duties imposed on me by these strange interlopers? The relief was unbelievable, like I was severed from a horrible burden. Even the thought of being forced to see a shrink didn&amp;rsquo;t seem so harsh compared to the prospect that maybe these attackers really were just a bad dream, a severely realistic dream, mind you, but a dream never the less.  Maybe, maybe the whole situation really was over. Maybe these horrible people did move on, and that the goat man was simply a mental projection of my own imaginative expectation towards whatever it was that those unnatural proceedings just beyond my sights were. You know&amp;hellip; speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nightfall came, and for the first time in a week, I felt no fear at the prospect of it. That felt good, like things were going back to normal. But I was wrong. I was so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I placed my head on my pillow, eyes already closing, consciousness already drifting away, I felt a lump under my pillow. Curiously I reached down there and felt something, something long and smooth. I pulled out a candle, a tall thin wax candle with a nice long wick. It was red, just like the one that the goatman was holding.  My heart sank, my mouth went dry, tears ran down my cheeks, and in that moment, I relived the entirety of last night all over, down to the very last detail where the guy holding me whispered in my ear how the blood of the ones I loved would be on my hand. Suddenly I was back in hell. I was back in the realm of terror. How did they get the candle under my pillow? Had I overlooked it this whole time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lie in bed until midnight. I didn&amp;rsquo;t dare close my eyes for fear of being held at knife point again, for fear of coming face to face with that horrible goat creature. The night was silent, no crickets, no birds, nothing, dead silence. I could see that it had turned twelve o&amp;rsquo; one. The memory of the goat mask in my mind uttering its instructions to me over and over again, go outside, light the candle sit behind it, do it or the blood of my loved ones will be on my hands&amp;hellip;at the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what it meant to have blood on your hands. The following day I would learn exactly what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around ten minutes in, I mustered up the courage to walk over to my window and look out it. What I saw choked me on the spot. Side by side at the entrance of the woods, I saw men. Shadowed by the night, standing side by side. There must have been twenty of them. None of them were saying anything. They were all dead silent, and I could feel their eyes on me. It was just as strong as when I felt the eyes of the dolls on me back at their sight. In a way, they felt like the same presence, the same intelligence. I can&amp;rsquo;t explain&amp;hellip; and then I saw him, the goat man. Or rather, the silhouette of him, standing in the center of the figures. He was still, still as a stone, but I could make out that face shape, the jutting horns&amp;hellip;I could make it all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chickened out. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go out there. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t. I hid in my bed, blankets over my head and I shut my eyes tight, crying all night. I didn&amp;rsquo;t fall asleep until I heard the early morning birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was awake by eleven thirty. Shortly after breakfast, I heard my dad shouting in the front yard. I went out to check and see what was happening, what it was that had him so upset. As I went out the front door, I could hear him more clearly, I could hear pain in his voice. A knot formed in my throat, and a harrowing sensation crawled across my skin. I was not ready to learn about the events that transpired, and that was truly the scariest part, the moment before actualization. These people have mentioned blood on my hands, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what it meant, but I had a very vague idea that it meant my family getting hurt. I thought they got my dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to him, I saw that he was on his knees, crying. Cash was killed. He was hit by a car. There he lay, goofy pointed ears, his absurdly silly dog beard, black staring eyes, and hanging tongue, stationary&amp;hellip; forever. I saw that his center torso had been collapsed, and I could see openings in his rearside, his ribs jutting out, his entrails-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;SON!&amp;rdquo; my dad cried out as he turned to hug me. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s okay!&amp;rdquo; He quickly led me back into the house, away from Cash&amp;rsquo;s lifeless body. Away from my best friend, dead and mutilated on the side of the road. The last thing I remember seeing as I was brought into the house was a large pickup truck driving by slowly. I saw the same two bald men, as old as dad, staring at me through oddly slim sunglasses. I saw blood on their front right tire&amp;hellip; and I saw the driver point directly at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash&amp;rsquo;s death was my fault. As I said it out loud, my dad held me tight and said with stone cold certainty that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my fault, that sometimes these things happen. He told me exactly what you would expect a father to tell his kid when their pet is killed in a random and seemingly pointless accident. But I knew better. The people in the woods killed Cash, and it was all because I didn&amp;rsquo;t do what they said. It was because I was a coward. His blood, was on my hands. Just as they said it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went into my room to cry, I saw outside my window, a man in the center of the back yard. A man with no shirt on. He was wearing a mask made out of a severed goats head, hollowed out on the inside. In the daylight it was far more disturbing to see, because I could almost smell the lack of sanitation it had to have exerted. I could see that it was surrounded by flies, but even worse than that, I saw a note it was holding up. A piece of paper with a single word written across it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIDNIGHT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle it. I ran outside, to chase him down, but when I got outside, it was gone. My hate and anger somehow superseded my guilt and sadness because I ran far into the woods before realizing that this time if I got lost, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have Cash to lead me back to the house. I would be all alone, no, I would have whatever was in here with me. I could feel eyes in here. I could feel eyes everywhere. My every move was being watched, from the autumn canopy, to the bushes just yards away, I knew I was surrounded in here, and as my senses came more clear from the adrenaline fueled rage I was experiencing, I realized that it was getting stronger by the minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I noticed the smell. The stench. At the time I thought it smelled like bad milk, or bologna left in the refrigerator for too long. It was strong, too strong. My eyes began to water, and I could feel my stomach begin to turn. How could a smell be so painful to endure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to me&amp;hellip;They killed my best friend. There was only one more life they could take: my dad&amp;rsquo;s. The presence became stronger, I could hear whispering in the wind, the smell grew more powerful with every breath. Any second, I was certain I would be overwhelmed by god knows what. I realized that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t do what they demanded of me, I would be taken here and now. What could I have done? I shook my head and began to cry. &amp;ldquo;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll do it&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relief was instantaneous. The woods became brighter, the smell gone, the feeling of being watched, replaced by what could only be described as serene. The forest went from a den of unspeakable terror, to a place of&amp;hellip;well, it was just woods again. Just as it always was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came back home and helped my dad dig Cash&amp;rsquo;s grave. We said our goodbyes and buried him. He made up a cute dog bone shaped tombstone out of leftover wood from his old workshop and that was that. My mom came over that day, and all went out to dinner at *Undisclosed* the food was the best I ever had. We gave Cash a little toast, and that was that. In the back of my mind&amp;hellip; midnight&amp;hellip; midnight&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent another silent night, staring at my clock, watching the numbers transform into the next every sixty seconds. The wait was agonizing. Each passing minute was like a minute removed from my life. That night, I was certain that I was going to die. And I was trapped. They would have killed my parents if I tried anything. Killing Cash made that entirely too clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eleven fifty-five&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eleven fifty-six&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eleven fifty-seven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eleven Fifty-eight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eleven fifty-nine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked out the window. There they all were. Side by side, shadows of people, and the goat man in the center. All their eyes were on me. I looked at the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked back out the window, they were all gone. They knew, they knew I was going to come out tonight. They Killed my dog, and then threatening to kill me on the spot after I followed them into the woods, they knew I was broken. My spirits shattered, and that I was more afraid of what would happen if I didn&amp;rsquo;t come out over what&amp;rsquo;d happen if I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the candle and walked into my backyard. The darkness was thick, thicker than usual, and the smell. Sour milk, spoiled lunch-meat, blood, rot, decay, shit, puke, bile, death&amp;hellip; my skin began to crawl, and a shiver took me over. Breathing became difficult. I could scarcely make out the forest before me. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just an entrance or a boundary, it was a living breathing thing, and it was anticipating my every movement. As I took a step into my yard, I jolt of terror shot through me as I passed through the motion sensors and activated the backyard light. There was relief in the light. Safety at least, for a little while anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used my father&amp;rsquo;s lighter to spark up the candle, I planted it into the cold dewy grass and sat down nice and slowly, ready to cross my legs. I never sat in the full position that I was instructed to because as I was in the process of sitting down, I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two green eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever shined your light directly on an animal&amp;rsquo;s face way off in the distance in the dead of night? At a distance where it was too far away to make out what it looks like, but not far enough for their eyes to not catch and reflect the light? This was exactly what I saw. Except it seemed to be high above the ground, higher than a coyote&amp;rsquo;s height, and higher even than a human&amp;rsquo;s height. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appeared to be pacing back and forth in the woods. I could hear the leaves shuffling with each step it was taking. Constantly coming in and out of existence due to the unseen trees eclipsing those glowing shards of light, those glaring eyes. They must&amp;rsquo;ve been reflecting off of the backyard light. I could hear it breathing. It sounded painful to me. The air came out in short sporadic breaths and when it did, I felt the huffs of frozen air rank with that rotten stench go right through me. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how long it paced like this, never leaving the outskirts of the woods, never breaking eye contact with me. Every now and then, it would stop, and lower closer to the ground, until it&amp;rsquo;s eyes were level with me. It would remain in that position, like a cat low to the ground, prepping to pounce its prey. It would only stay in this position for ten seconds at a time before it would rise back up and pace more. After it did this several times, I realized Something was stopping it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was dumbstruck, frozen in place. My throat was so tight, the air was barely getting in me, barely getting out of me. There was a powerful sense etched within my soul that any sudden movement would have sent this unspeakable thing into a frenzy at me, light or not. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if it was going to outright kill me here in the backyard, or if it was going to drag me into the woods and eat me alive there. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the relationship was between this and the psychopaths that ordered me out here. What I did know was that with each moment it wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting me, it was getting madder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let it get me. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let it take me away. Theoretically I was safe in the light, except the thing was that this motion sensor light ran on a timer. I knew that timer would soon run out, and when it did, the light would go and nothing would stop it from getting me. With all my courage, all my willpower I forced myself to stand up, letting out a horse breath. The eyes immediately stopped moving when it saw me stand. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you for certain, but I was almost positive they narrowed. The prospect of me escaping infuriated it to such a level that it began to stalk towards me. I could tell it was moving forward, threateningly, showing a willingness to brave the light. I took a step back, and when I did, it took a swift step forward. I could almost see its shape, tall, thin, boney, too dark to distinguish any specific features, except well, it had horns. Large curled spiral like horns. Or at least it looked like it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember running back to the house. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember making it inside. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember anything after the point where the light shut off. It was sudden, as if death caught me. The timer was up, the light shut down and enveloped me in darkness, and I recall  hearing it scream. It sounded like a child denied its toy. Or was that me? When the light died, I fucking ran!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hours later when I came to my senses. My dad was holding me. My mom was there too, I was crying. Later they would tell me that I was screaming: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t let it get me!&amp;rdquo;, over and over again, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t let it get me!&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t remember myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never saw that creature again. I never saw the man with the goat mask again. The two old men in the pickup truck, I never saw them again either. That day forward, I always slept with the window shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day my dad and my mom took me outside to explain that nothing had happened. We saw displaced grass, mixed with mud. We even saw gore marks on the trees. I thought this would be evidence enough to plead my case, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t. My dad immediately laughed at me, telling me he figured the whole thing out. I had an encounter with a deer. Those markings in the tree were from antlers and it charged at me because it felt threatened. This was such a convenient explanation that I fucking wished to God that it was true. But I knew otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several weeks later, I heard that there was a missing person search that took place in those woods, but I myself haven&amp;rsquo;t seen nor heard anything at the time. My dad and my therapist insisted that this knowledge would only enable my tendencies as a schizophrenic so they stopped me from looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia disorder, they said I got it through my inability to cope with the divorce. They told me that I had retracted into a delusion because I felt responsible for the family&amp;rsquo;s collapse and that my youthful undeveloped mind couldn&amp;rsquo;t process the guilt properly, that these cultists and their beast were just agents of personal symbolism. Something like that. For awhile I believed everything they told me. The lies felt safe. The lies were comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years later, they would tell me that I would have made a full recovery. It was an easy process since I never had another encounter again. At that point in time, I was so angry, I just told them what they wanted to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I became old enough, I severed all ties with my parents and I moved out of the state. Once I was on my own, I looked into the towns archives and researched as much information as I could about that era when I was nine. The missing person report, the manhunt in those woods lasted several days, and all they found was one man. He was torn apart, his limbs removed, his organs missing. They found that he was wearing a peculiar mask. The head of a ram, but its innards were carefully carved and hollowed to fit over a human&amp;rsquo;s head. When they removed the helmet, they saw that he had died with an expression of absolute horror. I took pleasure in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to believe that these men were cultists, that they were attempting to appease some unseen, unnamed god. A god that absolutely should not have existed, a god that had no right to walk among man. And that during their attempt to appease it, I had botched their ritual by breaking an important piece of the process: The doll, and in their attempt to salvage it, they forced me into offering myself up as a sacrifice to it. But its failure to do whatever it was going to do to me that night destroyed the whole operation. I would prefer to believe that in the name of vengeance this angry thing turned on its own worshipers. Killing them all and dragging them all back to where ever it came from. It&amp;rsquo;s the only thing that makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is just one thing I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out. Why is it, that no matter where I go, when I&amp;rsquo;m all alone, in quiet places, in the dead of night, why can I still hear them chanting that unholy sermon that I heard so long ago in the woods when I was nine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>On the Bus</title>
		<link>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/on-the-bus/</link>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streets, roads and dusty lanes of Colombia have been fertile territory for myths and legends since before the arrival of the Spaniards. Tales of ‘La Patasola&amp;rsquo;, a one-legged wailing banshee that forever sought her child, and of ‘El Duende&amp;rsquo;, a backwards-footed goblin that led travelers to their doom, nibbled at the corners of journeymen&amp;rsquo;s ease for centuries. Although these stories mainly troubled those living in or passing through rural areas, the growth of cities brought with it a new breed of urban legend rooted in the primal distrust we still harbor, somewhere deep inside, of modern technology. An example of this is the phantom bus that allegedly roams the city&amp;rsquo;s streets at night. Supposedly, young women who board it alone are found mutilated in overgrown outlying fields a few days later, a frozen look of abject terror illustrating the moment of their last, tormented breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, given that you&amp;rsquo;re certainly not a young woman (at least not last time you checked) and that it&amp;rsquo;s 5:30 on a Tuesday afternoon, phantom buses and handicapped gremlins are the last thing on your mind. You&amp;rsquo;ve been using Bogota&amp;rsquo;s public transportation system for over two decades, and your greatest concern is that traffic levels have become all but unmanageable since the latest mayor took office. However, home is about 80 blocks away, so your only choice is to wait until the right bus comes along. Walking would certainly take longer than putting up with any traffic jam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the bus displaying the route sign you&amp;rsquo;re hoping for shows up, its advertised fare is 200 pesos lower than the standard going rate these days. This usually indicates that the vehicle in question is older and a bit more uncomfortable than most, but no bus rider in the history of the city has ever given a damn about that. Folks that consider themselves richer and &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; this mode of transportation pay seven times as much to get around by cab, and statistically expose themselves to a higher chance of being mugged or robbed. More power to them, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never one to avoid seeking further discounts, you ask the wizened driver if he&amp;rsquo;ll let you on for a thousand. The wrinkled, musty-looking man&amp;rsquo;s eyes never leave the road as he silently takes your bill and slides it in the purse hanging from the bony gear stick. Satisfied, you turn your attention to the cabin; what would make this ride ideal would be an empty seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously enough (considering the time of day), there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough passengers aboard for anybody to be standing. A few available spots are in sight, so you choose one on the left, towards the middle. Both the aisle and window seat are free, and you sigh contentedly as you sprawl out on one with your knee nested on the other. This particular trip should be over in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver&amp;rsquo;s radio is off and your phone&amp;rsquo;s battery ran out an hour ago, so you pass the time staring out the window and watching vendors ply their wares and car drivers nod along to whatever music they&amp;rsquo;re enjoying. Your position eventually starts taking a toll on your back, so you straighten up and take the chance to examine your fellow passengers. None of them seem to be riding together, given that everybody&amp;rsquo;s quietly facing the front of the bus. They are also all uncommonly old&amp;mdash;not in the sense that they&amp;rsquo;re all over 100, but in the sense that nobody seems to be under 75. You find this a bit odd, and for a brief moment the idea that you don&amp;rsquo;t belong there flashes through your mind. It&amp;rsquo;s a silly thought, but combined with the bus&amp;rsquo;s particularly strong (although not necessarily atypical) smell of must and metal it makes you look forward to the end of the trip. Nevertheless, as there are another 30 or 40 blocks to go, you look out the window again, zone out, and let your mind go where it will for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sight of Pacho&amp;rsquo;s bakery pulls you out of your reverie twenty minutes later. You get up and make your way past your silent companions to the rear exit, where you hunt for the little silver button that will let the driver know you&amp;rsquo;ve reached your stop. As you spot it above the door, you realize that nobody&amp;rsquo;s boarded or left the vehicle since you got on, which is particularly weird for rush hour. Shrugging it off as a weird coincidence, you press down on the button and grab on to the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your seat, facing the front of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;hellip; what the hell just happened? You look around and see that everybody&amp;rsquo;s still where they were a moment ago. Trying to make eye contact with them is fruitless, since they all seem to be lost wherever it is that old minds wander. The thought of saying something runs through your head, but you decide against it. What would you say, anyway? You were probably so zoned out that you simply imagined getting up to ring the driver&amp;rsquo;s bell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s probably it; your daydreams are occasionally so vivid that leaving them is downright startling. Besides, you&amp;rsquo;re already two blocks past your stop. Call it a &amp;ldquo;weird thing that happened on your way home&amp;rdquo; or whatever, but for now you should just get off the bus. There&amp;rsquo;s no point in having to walk back too far. You (once again) get off your seat and head for the rear exit, somewhat unnerved by the other passengers&amp;rsquo; stoic disinterest in everything around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s the button, right where you remember it. Except that you can&amp;rsquo;t remember it, of course, since you&amp;rsquo;ve never actually been back here; you probably saw it when you got on. After grabbing on to the guardrail (these bastards occasionally decide to stop on a dime when you ring), you look towards the driver, put your thumb on the button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your seat, facing the front of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piercing chill runs down your spine, and instead of fading away, it spreads through every one of your extremities. It&amp;rsquo;s not a shift in body or ambient temperature, it&amp;rsquo;s the chill you feel when suddenly consumed by the level of fear that slightly precedes terror. Something really messed up is going on here. You don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, but you want out, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be here anymore. A feeling of bitter solitude is now gnawing at your mind; whatever these people around you are thinking, they clearly don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn about what&amp;rsquo;s going on with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, you once again decide to avoid saying anything and simply lift yourself off the seat, not processing the fact that you did it with less agility than should&amp;rsquo;ve been the case. All you want right now is to get off the bus. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s already advanced more than ten blocks past your street, which suddenly feels like a distastefully long distance to walk. This is all secondary to the point at hand, however; you have to get off this damn thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you make your way back, an old lady in the back row looks up at you. Her expression tells you nothing, but the way it fixes on you&amp;mdash;on your torso, to be precise&amp;mdash;as if you were just another chunk of the vehicle further spikes the almost overpowering sense of dread now coursing through your veins. Whatever, you can&amp;rsquo;t panic, not now. You stand at the back of the bus and, instead of going for the button, yell at the driver. You yell at him to stop, to let you off, that you&amp;rsquo;ve already rung twice, but nothing comes of it. You curse at him, tell him what he will die of and wish great evil upon his kin, but the door remains unmoved. The man is not listening. Or he doesn&amp;rsquo;t care. Or he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want you to get off. But you don&amp;rsquo;t give a damn what he wants or doesn&amp;rsquo;t want, so you grab on to the bars, take a step back for momentum, and send a solid kick right into the column of hinges that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your seat, facing the front of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a moment to register. Maybe more than a moment, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a full minute. And as you realize that the bus doesn&amp;rsquo;t want you to leave, you also realize that your right knee hurts with an unnatural, piercing sharpness. It&amp;rsquo;s the same leg you used against the door, and now it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s all but broken. This quickly becomes a distant concern when you attempt to massage it, though, because that&amp;rsquo;s when you notice your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not the hands of a 25 year-old. They are wrinkly, set with well-defined veins and even lightly patched with liver spots. As you study your hands and arms, cold terror envelops every corner your psyche. You touch your face and feel wrinkles and whiskers that didn&amp;rsquo;t previously exist upon your cheekbones. Your head is patched with a few anemic strands of hair; as your fingertip grazes your coarse scalp, a spark of electricity shoots through it and down into the most private recesses of your being. Your eyes dry up, opened wide and unbelieving, and you feel a seven-ton lump of horror coalesce in your otherwise paralyzed throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must leave this evil bus, you must leave it at once before it finishes what it&amp;rsquo;s begun. You carefully make your way off your seat&amp;mdash;no need for any further injury&amp;mdash;and head towards the front, towards the driver. Perhaps you can reason with him, or perhaps you can club him to death with a flashlight or something, since there are always a variety of trinkets and gadgets at the front of t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your seat, facing the front of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a good five or ten minutes for you to come to terms with what is happening to you, to understand that your life is vanishing before your eyes. Your hands are now like those of your grandmother, your back hurts from its base all the way to your neck, and your eyes can barely focus on the huge signs posted above the windows. Even your mind isn&amp;rsquo;t as sharp as it should be; it takes you a while to determine that you should make another attempt at the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps violence is not the answer, perhaps you can gently pull it open. Perhaps if you treat the bus like a living, gentle being instead of like a demonic machine it will let you out, perhaps&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old woman is looking at you again. You notice her blue jacket, which is much too big for her; if it were a blouse of the same size, it would hang loosely off her gaunt frame. A tiny, hesitant tear forms on her frail face, and then follows a meandering path down her ancient features to land on her wrist with eerie finality. There&amp;rsquo;s a red Totto watch around that wrist, the sort that is currently all the rage with kids graduating from high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You examine the door. Two panes joined by a vertical line of hinges, coated on the right by a rubber pad to avoid contact damage. The door is slightly bent inwards, and as you notice this a glimmer of hope runs through you. If you can just insert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your seat, facing the front of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON MY HANDS THEY ARE OLD MY HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF AN OLD MAN, NOT OF MY GRANDFATHER, OF AN OLD OLD THE MAN BEHIND YOU STARTS WHEN YOU TURN TO HIM AND YELL AT HIM AND GRAB HIS FACE AND SCREAM AT HIM TO LET YOU OFF HE MOUTHS SOMETHING YOU DON&amp;rsquo;T UNDERSTAND HIS TEETH HIS BLOOD YOUR TEETH OH MY GOD MY TEETH ARE LIKE TINY THEY ARE DUST THEY&amp;rsquo;RE WHAT THE HELL HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN HERE FUCK THIS I&amp;rsquo;M BREAKING THE WINDOW WITH MY ELBOW EVEN IF IT BREAKS I DON&amp;rsquo;T WANT TO DIE HERE NO MORE OF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your seat, facing the front of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long time, you glance down at your hands. They are the gnarled, rheumatic, blood-splattered claws of a hag that&amp;rsquo;s seen more than one generation&amp;rsquo;s share of horrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hag? A hag is not the right word. A hag is a woman, right? At least so it was in mother&amp;rsquo;s stories. Like those of La Patasola. Your knee still hurts, but not as much as your elbow. It feels like it is shattered. Ah, yes. This bus. You must get off it. You know you must get off it now. You do not remember why you must, but it is imperative that you do. It is urgent. It was urgent. You are so tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You try to lift yourself off the seat but your knee buckles under your weight; it is by chance that you fall back on the bench. You must get off the bus. You remember these buses. They used to take you to work. You steady yourself on the bench. You will try to get off the bus. But in a moment. You must rest. The bus can wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your seat, facing the front of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your seat, facing the front of the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Ronald McDonald House</title>
		<link>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/ronald-mcdonald-house/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 20:23:18 -0700</pubDate>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of the Ronald McDonald House charity. They provide housing
for the families of sick kids when they&amp;rsquo;re in the hospital. Seems pretty
innocent, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there&amp;rsquo;s another side to the charity. There&amp;rsquo;s another type of Ronald
McDonald House, one that not many people know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one in most big cities. You won&amp;rsquo;t find it by looking for it. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t
have an address. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a sign above the door. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have
windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the only way you&amp;rsquo;ll see it is if you&amp;rsquo;re taken there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s how I found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never met my real parents. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in and out of foster families and
group homes here in Detroit since I was a kid. I&amp;rsquo;m 15 now, and I&amp;rsquo;m what they
refer to as a &amp;ldquo;BAD KID&amp;rdquo;. Always causing trouble, always getting thrown out and
placed with another unsuspecting do-gooder who thinks they can help me. I always
prove them wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My caseworker sat across the black metal table, looking weary and frazzled. On
the table between us was a thick, letter-sized brown envelope; my case file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, your reputation has preceded you,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;And now you only have two
options; military school in Lansing, or the Ronald McDonald House, which has
miraculously cleared you for acceptance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the patience for drill sergeants and 5 AM reveille. And how bad
could a halfway house named after a fast food clown possibly be? Ronald McDonald
House it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark clouds loomed above me the day I climbed into the back of my caseworker&amp;rsquo;s
town car. My few belongings in a backpack and the clothes on my back; that was
all I could take. One of those few belongings was a photo album, filled with
pictures of all the foster families I had been with. It was nice to remember
some of them, even though I had royally fucked it up each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few cases who went through the Ronald McDonald House,&amp;rdquo; the
caseworker said from the front seat. &amp;ldquo;Things went so well for those kids. I
never had to transfer them anywhere else. In fact, the House took over their
case files and everything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove into downtown Detroit, past all the familiar landmarks. I had been
thrown out of one foster home just outside town because I snuck into downtown
Detroit with some neighbor kids to sneak into a dive bar. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, here we are.&amp;rdquo; The car came to a stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked out the window. We had parked in front of a tall, gray, windowless
building, sandwiched between two other industrial buildings on a narrow city
street. I noticed there was an address on the building to my left, and one on
the right, but none on this particular building. Not even a sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you sure?&amp;rdquo; I asked, hesitating as I opened the car door and climbed out of
the back seat. I slung my backpack over my shoulder, clinging tightly to the
strap, and followed the caseworker up to the windowless metal doors. She pressed
a buzzer, spoke to someone inside, and the doors clicked to unlock. We walked
in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the metal doors closed behind us, I noticed the pin-drop silence. It
was that sort of silence that&amp;rsquo;s so oppressive and empty, it almost deafens you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the dimly lit lobby, there was a glass window with someone inside. A
secretary. She was turned away, typing something intently. We walked over to the
window. The caseworker rang a bell on the counter, and the secretary spun around
in her chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her face was painted like a clown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Ronald McDonald, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She even had the short, curly, red hair. Otherwise, she wore a typical white
nurse&amp;rsquo;s dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to laugh at how bizarre it was, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. A chill swept down my
spine. Something was not right. I watched as the nurse and my caseworker
interacted; paperwork was passed through the window. The caseworker slid my case
file under the glass as the nurse slid her some papers to sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my caseworker signed the papers, the nurse looked at me. Her smile should
have been warm and welcoming&amp;hellip; but all I saw in her eyes was hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t stay here,&amp;rdquo; I stammered loudly. &amp;ldquo;Take me to the military school in
Lansing. PLEASE.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the matter, sweetie?&amp;rdquo; The nurse asked, her voice muffled slightly by the
glass. &amp;ldquo;Afraid of clowns?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked into her hungry eyes. Now there was a malicious glint as she laughed.
My caseworker laughed too, obliviously, and said, &amp;ldquo;Now now. Don&amp;rsquo;t overreact!
You&amp;rsquo;d hate the military school. Besides, this will be good for you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; said the clown nurse, &amp;ldquo;this will be good for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I could object, I heard a SLAM behind me. I spun around to see an open
door in the far corner of the lobby, to the left of the front desk window. There
was no one there, just some light that flooded in. Then creeping shadows. Shrill,
echoing laughter and growing shadows along the wall inside the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh!&amp;rdquo; said the caseworker, &amp;ldquo;Here comes the welcome committee!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stared in horror, clutching the strap of my backpack, my caseworker patted
me on the shoulder for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, honey. It&amp;rsquo;ll be different this time. You&amp;rsquo;ll feel right at home
here, I promise!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned to go. I felt bile churning in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; I said desperately. &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t leave me here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh no, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to get going. I never did like clowns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, she left me there. The metal doors slammed behind her, and I was
alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I faced the open doorway by the front desk again. The shadows had almost entered
the room, and the piercing laughter was filling the lobby with sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran for the front doors. I pounded and yanked and pushed and screamed.
Screamed for help, screamed for my caseworker, screamed for &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;ANYONE, PLEASE
GOD!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to see the nurse behind the glass smiling at me again. Then they
entered; a whole group of laughing nurses with clown faces and red hair. Some
were male, some female, but all had the same terrifying Ronald McDonald makeup.
And in the dim light of the lobby, I could see the glint of metal tools in their
hands. Bringing up the rear was a pair of clown nurses rolling a metal table,
complete with restraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Get the fuck away from me!&amp;rdquo; I screamed. I pounded at the metal doors again.
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Let me out of here!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They surrounded me. Grabbed me as I thrashed and screamed and tried to tear
myself away. Laughed as I kicked and squirmed. They slammed me onto the rolling
table and strapped me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around wildly. I was surrounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;LET ME GO!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; I screamed, twisting and turning and pulling at the restraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rolled me through the open doorway and down a seemingly endless white
hallway. They laughed and laughed and laughed. They waved their shiny scalpels
and razors and needles mere inches from my face, just to make me flinch and
scream. It made them laugh even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I remember, before one of them finally injected me, was the
hands. Gloved fingers prodded inside my mouth and pulled at my lips, distorting
my screams and forcing an unnatural grin onto my tear-streaked, sweaty face.
Hot, rancid breath was in my face, and a whispered, perverted voice spoke the
words, &amp;ldquo;We love to see you smile!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as the maniacal laughter seemed to warp and wind down like a dying record
player, everything faded to black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes and was blinded by bright lights above. Shielding my groggy
gaze from the fluorescent bulbs, I turned on my side and looked around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cell. Tall white walls, covered in scratch marks and stains. There was a small
drain in the corner of the floor; my toilet perhaps. A door with no windows. And
on the floor by the door, my backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to sit up. My body ached, and the moment I was upright, my vision
started spinning. I wondered what they drugged me with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized I was shivering. I looked down. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t wearing my own clothes
anymore. I was wearing a dirty, ripped hospital gown, bright yellow with a
pattern of Ronald McDonald heads all over. Nothing underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard faint, muffled sounds from somewhere in the building. It sounded like
screams. I tried to stand, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep my balance. My vision was beginning
to stabilize, but my body still felt like rubber. I sank to my knees and crawled
over to my backpack. Before I got there, I tried to open the door. As expected,
it was locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slumped onto the floor beside my backpack and unzipped it. All that remained
inside was the photo album. They&amp;rsquo;d taken my notebooks and pens and my cell
phone. Of course they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wearily opened the photo album. Instead of the photos that had been in
there&amp;hellip; ones of myself with my previous foster families, photos where I had
attempted to look happy and hopeful even though I knew I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there for
long&amp;hellip; instead of those photos&amp;hellip; there were crime scene photos. And in each
one, I recognized one of my former foster families, brutally murdered and
covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart raced and my stomach churned. I began to turn the pages quicker. Each
page, a new photo, a new family, new carnage. I recognized their faces and the
inside of their homes. I had lived with these people. And now they were all
dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to the last few pages. There was a photo of a house at night. Then a
window of that house. Then inside the house, a dark hallway with light coming
from one doorway. Then, a photo of my caseworker, brushing her teeth in the
bathroom mirror. Then a photo of her looking at the camera in horror. Then a
photo of her, naked, covered in her own blood, contorted into an unnatural
position in her bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to the last page. Written inside the back cover of the photo album were
three words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU&lt;br&gt;
NEVER&lt;br&gt;
EXISTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt bile rising in my stomach. I threw the book to the ground, crawled over
to the hole in the floor, and vomited. They were right. Having killed everyone
who ever knew me, it was as though I never existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard more faint screaming in the distance and knew I had to get out. I wiped
the vomit off my face with my hospital gown and crawled back over to my
backpack. Hopefully, they hadn&amp;rsquo;t found my secret weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unzipped the front pocket and reached down into the very bottom, my fingers
scraping the fabric. Sure enough, there they were, flush with the seams in the
bag, nearly undetectable. The pins I used for picking locks. I told you, I&amp;rsquo;m a
bad kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leaned against the door and listened. I could hear footsteps approaching. But
just as soon as they arrived, they faded in the other direction. I knew I had to
work fast. I jiggled the handle with one hand and picked the lock with the
other. It was surprisingly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding the handle, I slowly pulled myself to my feet. I could maintain my
balance now. I pulled the door open just a crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clown nurse darted past. My heart almost stopped. But his footsteps didn&amp;rsquo;t
slow or change and soon faded; he didn&amp;rsquo;t notice me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I poked my head out the door. There were seemingly endless white hallways in
either direction. The distant screams were louder now, coming from all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a deep breath, I stepped into the hallway and closed the door behind me.
I decided to go to the right. Passing doors identical to the one I had been
behind, I heard screams and sobbing. I stopped for a moment at one door and
heard the crying of a child inside. I jiggled the handle to see if I could let
him out. Locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept moving, looking behind me every few seconds to make sure no nurses had
come into the hallway. Then I passed a set of white double doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped again. The word &amp;ldquo;PLAYPLACE&amp;rdquo; was written in tall, thin letters across
the width of both doors. I heard more screaming coming from within, the screams
of multiple people. And laughter. The insane, shrill laughter of the clown
nurses. I shuddered. I was afraid to find out what sort of torture was happening
inside. And I knew I had to keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a door ahead with a stairway symbol and headed for it. As I opened the
door, I glanced behind me and saw two clown nurses emerging from the PlayPlace
room. Their white nurse outfits were covered in streaks of blood. I quickly shut
myself into the stairwell, hoping they hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stairwell was dimly lit, with cement walls and rusty railings. I looked at
the door I had just closed. There was a red number 5 on it; I must have been on
the 5th floor. I decided I had to get to the ground level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each footstep echoed as I began to descend the stairs. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear the
screaming anymore; just a low, deep humming sound, like pipes in the walls. It
was a welcome respite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally came to the door numbered 1. The staircase seemed to descend a few
floors lower, but I stopped here and slowly peeked through the door. More white
hallways. No clown nurses to be seen. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stepped through the door and walked into the hallway. I noticed I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
hear any screaming on this floor. Just the buzz of the fluorescent tube lights
above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to the end of the hallway and another set of double doors. A large red
cross&amp;mdash;the kind you&amp;rsquo;d see on a lifeguard stand or first aid kit - was painted
across the width of them. I pressed my ear to one door. All I heard was a slow,
rhythmic pulse, like a machine at work. And, faintly, a beeping sound&amp;hellip; like
you&amp;rsquo;d hear in a hospital room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have opened the door. I knew this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the exit, that I
should keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned the handle. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t locked. I peeked inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cavernous white room. Fluorescent lights flickered and buzzed. I saw
wires hanging all around&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;hellip; hanging from the ceiling, in rows&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids. Kids in hospital gowns like mine, attached to white wooden crosses affixed
to the ceiling. Literally crucified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were silent, their heads drooping forward, their eyes either closed or
staring at nothing. Some seemed to twitch a bit, but most were still. Their
crosses swung back and forth very slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the hanging wires&amp;hellip; they weren&amp;rsquo;t wires. They were intravenous tubes
attached to the kids&amp;rsquo; wrists. Tubes sucking out their blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost vomited again right then and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the very center of the room, amidst the rows of hanging crosses, I could see
where the rhythmic pulsing sound came from: a huge steel cylinder which seemed
to be collecting the blood from all of the tangled tubes that dangled from the
kids&amp;rsquo; wrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth to&amp;hellip; to scream? To cry out in anger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I could say was, &amp;ldquo;What the fuck?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was when the alarms began to sound. Loud and piercing, like the police
sirens of hell. They must have realized I was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shut the doors and frantically glanced around the hallway to see if anyone was
coming. No signs yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran for the stairwell. As soon as I entered it, I heard laughter from above,
echoing and reverberating. The clown nurses were coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled down the stairs as fast I could. I must have gone another three
stories before I reached the basement. I found myself running through a dark,
sewer-like hallway, with small light bulbs overhead every 10 yards or so. The
smell of decay and rotting flesh grew more and more pungent as I ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laughter continued behind me. I managed to glance over my shoulder and see a
group of them running after me. I saw them come into the light, then become
silhouettes again, their smiling faces, gleaming knives, and needles pushing my
adrenaline to the max. I ran past alcoves full of stacked, rotting corpses. But
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of anything but escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned a corner and found myself facing the metal rungs of a ladder in the
wall. I climbed until my head smacked the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below me, the shadows and laughter grew closer. Their footsteps slowed. They
were close and they knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pushed at the ceiling above me, heaving upward and panting and screaming. The
clowns were below me, laughing and waving their scalpels. Something cut my leg.
I screamed and pushed one last time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceiling gave way as a manhole cover slammed onto asphalt above. A circular
opening. I climbed out and frantically pushed the cover back over the hole,
blocking out the laughter of the clown nurses below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laid there on top of the manhole cover for a few minutes as I caught my
breath. Rain fell onto my skin. The turbulent night sky above was a welcome
sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around. Abandoned buildings, broken glass. No lights. No cars. No signs
of any life at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A police siren somewhere in the distance. Then, silence. I climbed to my feet.
Pain shot through my leg. I looked down and saw the cut on my ankle where a
clown nurse had slashed me. Bastards. Limping the best I could, I started to
walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello?&amp;rdquo; I called out. The only answer was a distant roll of thunder. &amp;ldquo;Somebody!
HELP ME, PLEASE!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My foot fell on something soft and mushy. I looked down. A newspaper. I peeled
it off the wet asphalt. Most of the ink had faded, but I was able to make out
the date: July 13, 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped it, an icy dread filling my stomach. I kept walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?!&amp;rdquo; I screamed. &amp;ldquo;PLEASE! Anyone&amp;hellip; please&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My words faded into delirious sobs. I stood still for a moment. The rain had
soaked through my thin hospital gown. I shivered as the wind blew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw a light in the distance. It was a big, yellow &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; in the sky. A
McDonald&amp;rsquo;s. Of course. I limped toward it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the place, I saw that apart from the M, the rest of the building
was completely dark. I walked cautiously toward the broken windows and looked
inside. Darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned and surveyed the PlayPlace outdoor playground; ten foot tall structures
of colored tubes for kids to crawl through. Sitting at one of the benches was a
familiar figure. The Ronald McDonald statue. You know, the one where you can sit
beside him and it looks like he&amp;rsquo;s got his arm around your shoulders. Every kid
has seen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shuddered at the sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doors were unlocked. I walked in, out of the rain. Silence. Darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the decor wasn&amp;rsquo;t like the modern McDonalds&amp;rsquo; you see. It was the
same as it was in the 80s, with white plastic booths and red and yellow tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind seemed to whisper through the broken windows. I noticed something on
the front counter. A black rectangle. I got closer. A laptop. A nearly new
laptop. I let out a soft, delirious laugh. I knew what I was supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the laptop outside and sat beside the Ronald statue. I opened it and
began to type this story. The rain is falling on the keys, but I don&amp;rsquo;t care.
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing left to do now but wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing, out of the corner of my eye&amp;hellip; Ronald is trying to
look over my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s laughing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can do is join him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things that escape those who dream only at night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Edgar Allen Poe, &amp;ldquo;Eleanora&amp;rdquo;&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go to bed and wait for the Sandman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as it came out of James&amp;rsquo;s mouth it seemed to him a strange thing to say, and he was not sure why he had, but for some reason it worked: Daniel went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, though, he asked: &amp;ldquo;What does the Sandman look like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James was making breakfast. Daniel sat at the table, short legs swinging under his chair. &amp;ldquo;Nothing, really,&amp;rdquo; James said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just an expression.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What does it mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just something people say.&amp;rdquo; He put a plate of eggs in front of Daniel and kissed him on the top of his head. He thought that would be the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until he saw the Sandman for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was getting ready for bed and stopped by Daniel&amp;rsquo;s room to check on him while he slept, as he often did. It was such a routine precaution that when he saw a pale, naked man sitting on the edge of Daniel&amp;rsquo;s bed, rocking back and forth, it took a moment for him to process what he was seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reacted the way any father would, of course: He ran into the room screaming, and for a moment he thought about attacking the intruder, but then the man on the bed turned, and that&amp;rsquo;s when James saw that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a man: It was a pale, slithery thing, hairless and warped, its joints turned the wrong way and its body out of shape with itself. When it moved it was like an insane marionette dancing on a stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James froze. The skittering thing watched him. He felt spreading warmth, and he realized he&amp;rsquo;d pissed his pants. Only when he remembered that Daniel was still there in bed, staring at the broken-shaped thing sitting a foot away, did he regain the courage to move. He grabbed Daniel and ran. In the hall he turned to see if the thing would follow them, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t. For a moment it watched and then, moving like a stop-motion nightmare, it crawled to the window and jumped out, leaving only the billowing curtains to mark its passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James had trouble talking to the police. He reported a break-in, but when asked to describe the intruder he didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to say. How could he make the ordinary man in the blue uniform sitting at his kitchen table while two of his colleagues searched the house understand a thing like he&amp;rsquo;d seen? He couldn&amp;rsquo;t even understand it himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it worse, Daniel&amp;rsquo;s memory did not correspond to James&amp;rsquo;s: He described an ordinary looking burglar. &amp;ldquo;A man in a mask,&amp;rdquo; he said. James thought about it: Had it been a mask? No, it would had to have been a full costume, and an elaborate one, something like they would use for a movie. And that would not explain the way it moved&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the end he simply echoed his son&amp;rsquo;s testimony: &amp;ldquo;A man in a mask,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;A burglar.&amp;rdquo; The lie unsettled him almost as much as what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors said Daniel wasn&amp;rsquo;t hurt and showed no signs of molestation. James was relieved. They stayed at a motel for a couple nights until they felt ready to come home, and then James had a new security system installed, along with bars on the windows. He didn&amp;rsquo;t like the sight of them in Daniel&amp;rsquo;s room, but it seemed like the only thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James was frightened that first night back in the house, but Daniel, strangely, was not. When asked if he felt okay sleeping alone, he just said yes. In the end it was James who found himself wishing he were not sleeping alone. He was up all night listening for the sound of anything moving in the house. Although he had convinced himself that his memory was faulty and that it had been a normal (albeit probably deeply disturbed) man in his son&amp;rsquo;s room, when he closed his eyes even for a moment he pictured bloodless skin and a twisted, inhuman face. He found himself wondering, why my house? Why my family? He knew, of course, that there didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a reason. But still, he wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later Daniel stopped talking. James didn&amp;rsquo;t notice at first; kids went through quiet phases sometimes. But eventually he tried to get Daniel to talk, and he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. Eventually, it became clear that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the doctor they went. Nothing wrong with him that we can see, was the diagnosis. Was it the trauma, James asked? Could be, they said. Sometimes these things come on late. Children can be a mystery even to those who know them best. They recommended a child psychologist, whom James couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford. He could not, for that matter, even afford the bill they were giving him now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing seemed to help. Daniel would write out answers to questions sometimes, but never more than a yes or no. When James would ask him what was wrong, or if he&amp;rsquo;d seen or heard anything that frightened him, Daniel would only stare. He seemed furtive and bemused. James found himself missing the sound of his son&amp;rsquo;s voice. Sometimes he wanted to hear it so bad that he ached. But it seemed that Daniel would not talk again until he was ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James had other things to worry about, too. He was convinced, beyond reason, that the intruder was not really gone. Though the alarm never went off and the locks and bars remained undisturbed, he was sure that he heard movement in the night. Not normal movement: It was a sound like a huge snake slithering through the house. When he heard it, he imagined horrible things. Nothing was ever there when he went to investigate, though he often thought he glimpsed something just out the corner of his eye, a pale foot or a misshapen shadow that would slink away as soon as he turned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He rarely slept, and when he did he had haunted dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon he realized he had not left the house in weeks except to go to the bank and buy groceries. He felt hemmed in. With Daniel acting mute he hadn&amp;rsquo;t had an actual conversation with anyone in weeks, so he called his mother. The connection was bad and her voice sounded faint, on the verge of being not there at all. &amp;ldquo;I guess I&amp;rsquo;m okay, Ma,&amp;rdquo; he said, pausing to wipe the sweat from his palms and then make sure he could hear Daniel playing in the next room. &amp;ldquo;But things have been a little rough. We had a break-in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh how awful!&amp;rdquo; Mom said. &amp;ldquo;Did they take anything?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nah. Just ran off. It was weird though. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really felt comfortable since then.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you still working at that hospital?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No Ma, I left last year, you know that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh. Well, have you been getting out? What about that nice woman you were seeing last year, the one who played the piano?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James scowled. She was always asking that kind of thing. Didn&amp;rsquo;t she know how hard it was being a single father? That he didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time? He was about to say so when something made him pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ma, is there anyone else on the line?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think so?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James was sure he heard it, though: the short, gasping sound of someone trying to hold their breath and failing. A cold feeling crept across the back of his neck. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re sure nobody is listening on your other phone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dear, there is no other phone, I&amp;rsquo;m on the cell, that&amp;rsquo;s why the service is so bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Then what is&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; James stopped. If the sound wasn&amp;rsquo;t coming from her end, then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dropped the phone and raced to the hall. The extension hung on its hook, undisturbed. Heart pounding, he hurdled into the garage; the spare phone sat on the workbench. No one was in sight. But could they have been? Could someone have been here all along, listening to his phone call, and then slithered away? Might they be here even now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day he took out the extra phone extensions. He even filled in the jacks with rubber cement. Daniel watched him work, eyes curious, but James offered no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began giving Daniel a light physical exam every week. His CNA training was a little rusty after a year on disability, but you never really forget. It was an absurd thing to do, of course; even if there was a physical cause for Daniel&amp;rsquo;s behavior, it would be nothing he could discover this way. And he was aware on some level that it was compulsive behavior. Nevertheless, it made him feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning James set the diaphragm of the stethoscope against Daniel&amp;rsquo;s chest, but he could not locate a heartbeat. He moved his hand in search of the right spot, to no avail. Then, to test it, he listened to his own heartbeat; it came through steady and clear. But when he checked Daniel again he didn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything. A thought came unbidden to him of the Tin Man in &amp;ldquo;The Wizards of Oz&amp;rdquo;, whose chest was empty as a kettle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sick feeling roiled his stomach. He threw the stethoscope down and grabbed Daniel by the shoulders, looking into his face. Daniel stared back with bright eyes. He even smiled a little, with the corners of his mouth. James felt the tingle of tears. He swept his son up in his arms and hugged him, and Daniel hugged back. Then James put his shirt back on him and sent him to play. The stethoscope, he decided, was broken. He threw it in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got worse. James&amp;rsquo;s terrors were no longer relegated to the long hours of the night. Now it seemed that some creeping, some skittering and scuttling, some unknowable noise in some dark corner or another, filled every second of his day. The thought of how big the house really was started to weigh on him: There were so many rooms he wasn&amp;rsquo;t in at any given time, so many places someone&amp;mdash;or something—else could be. He imagined strange figures occupying the rest of his home when he wasn&amp;rsquo;t around, melting into the walls or merging with the shadows whenever he turned on a light or opened a door. How would he know if they were there? How would he ever know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon he didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to be outside of a room to imagine it. When he walked up the stairs he pictured pale figures lurking beneath them. When he went down the hall he pictured a crawling thing slithering behind the walls, shadowing his every step. If he sat too long in the same chair he imagined that it was right behind him. And he was never comforted when he turned around and found nothing there, as he could only guess that meant it had moved, swiftly and silently, behind him once again. Wherever he was not looking right now, that was where he imagined it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was losing his mind, he knew. The only thing that helped him cling to sanity was that Daniel seemed undisturbed. Other than his muteness, his behavior was perfectly normal. And whenever he seemed to sense that his father was troubled he would hug him, or squeeze his hand, or even smile. Sometimes, when he left the room, James cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night he found himself creeping around the house with no lights on at two o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning. If the intruding thing had taken to violating his daytime activities then he would get revenge by confronting it on its own terms: the night. And really, night was no more frightening to him now than day. They were almost interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He padded barefoot down the halls, up the stairs, in and out of disused rooms. Sometimes he stopped to listen, hoping to locate it by sound; it was a stealthy, creeping thing, he knew, but it was awkward at times, and it couldn&amp;rsquo;t always keep its strangely shaped limbs from making their distinct, irregular footsteps. The smallest noise would give it away&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one room he suspected it spent most of its time in: the spare bedroom. Not a bedroom at all, really, more like a closet just large enough to accommodate a bed if one were so inclined. It was unpainted and uncarpeted and drafty; he&amp;rsquo;d always meant to fix it up. He didn&amp;rsquo;t come in here very often because he disliked the bare, unused look of it. It made him think of a partially dissected corpse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came in now, though. If the thing made its nest any one place in the house, this would be it. Of course, there was nothing there now&amp;hellip;but that didn&amp;rsquo;t mean there was nothing there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cursed, running a hand through his sweat-damp hair. What was he missing? How did it hide from him? What was its secret? He peered into the room&amp;rsquo;s empty corners one by one, getting his face a few inches from the plaster and floorboards so that he could be certain—certain!—that there was no space for it to conceal itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light bulb flickered. He froze. My God, he thought&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s on the ceiling! He pictured it crawling above him like a huge, pale lizard. That’s how it gets around, he thought, that&amp;rsquo;s how it escapes anytime I should have it cornered, it just scuttles up the wall and hides right over my head! He imagined it dangling down behind him like a spider. If I turn around, he thought, it will be there, hanging with its face right next to mine. He held his breath. He did not want to turn around, but he had no choice; it was between him and the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a quiet sob, he rounded on his heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, he was alone. There was no man on the ceiling; he checked twice. Maybe it crawled out and was waiting for him in the hall&amp;hellip;but when he checked there the coast was once again clear. It should have been a relief, but it was not. After all, it had to be in here somewhere. If the ceiling was not its trick that just meant it was something else, something even more strange, even more clever&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went to Daniel&amp;rsquo;s room. He had not stopped checking on him at night, like he always had. This time, though, rather than open the door he listened at it first, pressing his ear against the grain of the cheap wood and holding his breath, terrified that he would hear a skittering sound on the other side of the barrier. What he heard instead shocked him more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel was talking to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James recoiled for a second and then, when he&amp;rsquo;d caught his breath, he all but kicked the door in. Daniel was already awake, indeed, sitting up in bed, but he was not saying anything now. The light flashed on and James stalked halfway into the room before stopping, suddenly torn: What did he want more, to confirm that his son could speak again or to find whomever he was speaking to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creak of a door hinge settled the matter for him. He ran to the closet and threw it open: There was nothing inside, or at least, nothing that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there. He swept aside clothes on their hangers, but nothing was hiding between them. Then he dragged the toy box out and emptied it into the floor: Nothing. He combed along the bare walls and floor and, yes, the ceiling, pushing aside every last bit of rubbish and stray knick-knack so that he could be sure, absolutely sure, that nothing was hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the while Daniel watched him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes James was panting and covered in sweat and the closet was bare, and there were neither intruders nor answers inside. It struck him as funny, somehow, and he started to laugh, very quietly. He kicked his son&amp;rsquo;s toys out of the way as he went to sit down on the bed, dazed. He became aware, all at once, of several things, first being that he had not slept in days and was nowhere near his right mind. The second was how close he&amp;rsquo;d come to really losing it, for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, he decided, they would both sleep until the afternoon, and when they did wake up he and Daniel would get out of this creaky old house. No more staying cooped up like prisoners, and no more checkups, and no more dreams about monsters. He would even take the bars off the windows. It was time to get back to living like real people again. It was time to&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James saw it when he brushed a hand through Daniel&amp;rsquo;s hair. He pulled Daniel (a little too roughly) closer. His son acquiesced to the examination without fidgeting or complaint as James pawed the side of his head, hoping that what he was seeing would somehow stop being apparent. He stared and stared until he ached from not blinking, but there was no denying what was right in front of his eyes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel was missing an ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, he realized with mounting nausea: both ears. There was no injury, no incision, no mark where they should have been, simply smooth, blank flesh. As blank as Daniel&amp;rsquo;s quiet, unperturbed demeanor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James swept him up in his arms and ran into the hall. He was not sure where he was going or what he meant to do when he got there, he just knew that there was now nothing more important than getting his son out of that house. But their path was cut off: A naked man sat in the hallway with his back to them. No, not a man: James recognized its stretched limbs and stooped shoulders. The pale thing squatted on its haunches, rocking back and forth like it was palsied. It almost seemed to be in pain. James hugged his son closer and backed away. Then he heard Daniel&amp;rsquo;s voice: &amp;ldquo;dad-ee.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James turned to Daniel, and he heard the voice again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;dad-ee.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Daniel&amp;rsquo;s lips hadn&amp;rsquo;t moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James looked back at the hunched figure. Its head jerked when it talked, like a tic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;hello. dad-ee.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James&amp;rsquo; mouth went dry. It took several tries before he could speak. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t call me that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;it is. this voice&amp;rsquo;s name. for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Go away. Leave my family alone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;but i am. your family.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer it talked the more the voice became distorted and blurred. An icy feeling nestled in James&amp;rsquo; stomach. &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;someone. who came to visit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;you. invited me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James&amp;rsquo; heart thudded against the inside of his chest. &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;i had. something you wanted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James licked his dry lips. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re lying. You don&amp;rsquo;t have anything I want. I want you to leave. Leave, and never come back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;who. is. daniel&amp;rsquo;s. mother?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James blinked. &amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;who. is. daniel&amp;rsquo;s. mother?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What the hell kind of question is that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;how. old. is. daniel?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James blinked again. The thing&amp;rsquo;s voice caused a pinching pain in the center of his forehead. &amp;ldquo;Stop asking me these things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;when. is. daniel&amp;rsquo;s. birthday?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;what. is. his. middle. name?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shut up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;what. was. his. first word?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I said shut up!&amp;rdquo; James wanted to tear the thing apart with his bare hands. Only the heaviness of Daniel in his arms kept him where he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;you were. alone. you wanted. a son. so i. made one. for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James&amp;rsquo; hands began to shake. &amp;ldquo;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. Made out of what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;out of. myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James&amp;rsquo; stomach turned over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;but now. i need those parts. back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel picked at James&amp;rsquo; shoulder to get his attention. Something was strange about Daniel&amp;rsquo;s face. &amp;ldquo;Danny? Open your eyes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel scrunched his eyes shut tighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open your eyes. Danny? Danny. Open your eyes. Open your eyes!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel shook his head, trying to refuse, but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold it forever. Eventually his eyelids flicked up and James saw the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;rsquo;s eyes were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James almost dropped him. For a second he wanted to throw his son down so that he could stop looking into those empty holes in his face. Daniel opened his mouth, as if to speak, but of course, he had no voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;he is coming back. to be part of me. again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No. No, no, no, give him back, give him back!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;i. cannot. it has been. too long. i warned you. this. would happen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re lying! You&amp;rsquo;re lying, you&amp;rsquo;re a fucking liar, give me my son back, give him back!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;i. do not lie. i. warned you. he could not exist forever. but you. do not remember. you. can only remember. what i want you to. you forget. all the times. we have talked.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel felt like a doll, or an empty bag. His hair was falling out, disappearing before it touched the ground. His hands vanished into his sleeves and his feet rolled up inside his pants cuffs. James cradled the tiny, shapeless thing. Tears streamed down his face. Soon he held a pile of empty clothes, and then those too were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked around the house; toys disappeared, photos vanished from their frames, Daniel&amp;rsquo;s little shoes were no longer by the door. James turned toward Daniel&amp;rsquo;s room and confronted a wall where the door should be. He groped the blank surface, fingertips scrambling. He hit his head against the wall. The pain didn&amp;rsquo;t feel real. &amp;ldquo;Why did you do this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;it was. what you wanted. and i learned. so much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is impossible. People will ask, people will wonder: the police, the hospitals, the people in the neighborhood!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;they. have already. forgotten him. they only. remembered. what i wanted them to. like you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James pressed his hands to his aching skull. &amp;ldquo;Will I at least remember him after this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;you. can try. but your mind. will fail you. now that everything. he was. is part of me. again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James sat on the floor, looking at the blank wall. Out the corner of his eye he saw the thing creep toward him and even felt its wet hand on his shoulder, but he did not look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I won&amp;rsquo;t remember any of this,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;then why tell me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;because. a father. should know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then James was alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abigail worried about James sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they met a year ago, he said that he&amp;rsquo;d never been married and he&amp;rsquo;d never had kids, but there was a certain pained expression he assumed when he said the last part. Abigail knew that look: She&amp;rsquo;d met parents who lost children before. You learned to recognize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there were other things about him that worried her too. Sometimes she would find him staring at a particular spot on the wall, brow furrowed in concentration. He did not seem to realize he was doing it. And of course there was the insomnia, and the sleepwalking to consider too. Yes, there was lots to worry about. But she loved him all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James still said he&amp;rsquo;d never had kids, and neither had she. She&amp;rsquo;d long wanted one, but it was impossible, and she worried that James wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stay with a woman who couldn&amp;rsquo;t be a mother (though he constantly assured her that it was not so). There were times—and more and more often of late they were the nights when James took to sleepwalking, and even Abigail imagined that she heard strange, scuttling noises in the house and saw impossible shapes in dark corners—when she thought she would do anything, absolutely anything, if it meant having a little daughter for she and James to raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at those moments, she became truly afraid. But she never knew why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Mark and I love exploring abandonments. We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it for years, and I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, it never gets old. The constant creepy feeling, finding new areas, guessing at the history - it&amp;rsquo;s almost addicting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the first time we did it, we were hooked. Still, you can only explore houses for so long before you have to move on to something bigger, and that&amp;rsquo;s what led us to what happened last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was this huge abandoned hospital near us, just a few towns over. We&amp;rsquo;d never seen it ourselves, but knew that it had been abandoned for several decades, having closed down in favor a smaller, more modern one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark shot me down the first few times I suggested it, since he was worried about getting caught by the police. Eventually I was able to convince him though, pointing out that they&amp;rsquo;d probably just tell us to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around 7:30 PM when we left, but it was summer, so the sun was still up. On the way there, we went over the plan one more time. The hospital was pretty isolated, and the area around it was overgrown. The idea was to drive to a parking lot about a quarter mile away. From there, we&amp;rsquo;d sneak through the bushes, and by the time we got there, it would be dark enough to walk across that last paved stretch to the front doors unseen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the parking lot, we stood by the car for a few minutes. The road next to the lot went by the hospital, and we wanted to get an idea for the traffic (and, therefore, our chances of being seen). It seemed like our odds were pretty good: In the ten minutes we waited, only a single car went by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we checked our supplies. For each of us: a flashlight, a bottle of water, some disinfectant, a box of band-aids, and a cheap radio, for when we inevitably decided it would be creepier if we split up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I started for the trees, Mark tapped me on the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I almost forgot, I got this from the library earlier.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reached into his backpack and retrieved a rolled up piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a map of the building, for the fire exits and stuff. You take it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked, &amp;ldquo;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t a map kind of defeat the purpose of exploring?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll only look at it if we have to. If one of us gets hurt, it would kind of suck to bleed to death looking for the exit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright, but why do I have to take it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because &amp;lsquo;one of us&amp;rsquo; means me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a point. In the years we&amp;rsquo;d been exploring, we&amp;rsquo;d had three total injuries. All of them were him. I put the map in my back pocket, and we started towards the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as planned, it was dark when we got there. Because of the surrounding trees, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t make out a clear silhouette of the building against the sky. Shining our flashlights on it showed a brick exterior, and three floors. Most of the windows were broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main entrance was wide open. One of the double-doors was on the ground nearby, with the other nowhere to be found. Most definitely, we were not the first people to check it out, which was expected. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to break in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place was in really bad shape. The floor was covered in dirt, and most of the doors had been kicked in. There were holes in most of the walls, indicating that thieves had taken the copper wiring. There was also loads of water damage. With all of this, do I even have to mention the graffiti?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first floor was probably the most interesting. It had the cafeteria, staff room, and, by far most interestingly, the morgue. There was even a set of tools left behind. As a rule, we don&amp;rsquo;t take things from abandonments, but at that time we really wanted to. We went up the stairs to the second floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, most of doors were intact, and there was no graffiti. I guess the teenagers looking for trouble were too lazy to climb a set of stairs. The thieves had motivation though, and there were just as many holes in the wall as downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this time that, as always, Mark wanted to split up. I tend to take my time, and he moves pretty quickly in comparison. I go for details, he aims to see everything. Because of this, I knew he&amp;rsquo;d end up far away from me. It was alright with me though, as I kind of liked the silence. The creepiness is a big part of what makes it fun, and if he didn&amp;rsquo;t split us up, I probably would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second floor was mostly just patient rooms. Beds and tables, nothing much. As I was exploring, I could hear Mark&amp;rsquo;s footsteps upstairs. They&amp;rsquo;d go a distance, stop, I&amp;rsquo;d hear the faint sound of a door opening, and then I&amp;rsquo;d hear him move away. He really had gotten ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d only explored about half of the floor, because I then came across a relatively large sitting room, which was in the middle of the building. It was actually pretty well illuminated by moonlight, thanks to the large window that made up one wall. Looking out, I could see the paved front area we had entered from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really need the flashlight, so I turned it off. There was a coffee table in the center of the room, surrounded by four old sofas. I sat down at one of them for a water break. It was pretty creepy, just sitting there alone, everything bathed in a dull blue light. I kept seeing things out of the corner of my eye, but in that light, this was expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just putting my bottle away when I heard my radio crackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark said, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of lost here. Can you help me find you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have been annoyed at having to use the map, but after seeing things for a few minutes, I was kind of creeped out, and wanted to get back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright,&amp;rdquo; I asked, &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s the nearest room number?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in room 308.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re in the East wing, third floor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where do I go from here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Walk so that the numbers are descending. There should be a staircase next to 301.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two minutes went by. I was about to try talking to him again when he came back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay, these stairs are blocked. Where are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in a sitting area in the middle of the second floor. I take it you&amp;rsquo;re next to 301 now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay, now you&amp;rsquo;ll want to move in ascending order then. There should be an employee staircase next to 349. That leads down here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the hall from the sitting room, according to the map, was a staff lounge. This was where the stairs went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ten more minutes, I could hear Mark&amp;rsquo;s footsteps above me. Once again, the radio crackled on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These stairs right here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yep, I can hear you above me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I listened to him walk off, I went to the door of the staff lounge. On the other side, I could hear Mark descending the steps and walking across the room. When he reached the door, the knob jiggled, but it was locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I yelled through the door to unlock it. Strangely, he answered through the radio, even though he was just on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The lock is broken. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to open it for me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;rsquo;t like damaging sites, but I was way too freaked to keep sitting there by myself while I lead him to another staircase. I backed up and got ready to kick the door down. Just as I was about to kick it, my cell phone rang. I practically jumped through the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What? Christ, you scared the crap out of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And you&amp;rsquo;ve been scaring the crap out of me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked, &amp;ldquo;What do you mean I&amp;rsquo;ve been scaring you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You weren&amp;rsquo;t answering your radio. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting outside for like 20 minutes, where are you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to the sitting room and looked out the window. Sure enough, there he was on the pavement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said, &amp;ldquo;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;m on the second floor, the big window in the middle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw him look around for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, I see you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then that I heard a loud series of bangs. I ran into the hall. The staff room door was shaking with each hit. Whoever was on the other side was wailing on it, trying to get out. I turned around and tore out of there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met up with Mark outside, and without a word, we ran through the woods to the parking lot. We got in the car, and sped off towards his house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got there, I told him what had happened. Then, he gave me his experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I went ahead of you to the other end of the second floor, I tried to go upstairs. It was blocked by debris, but I heard footsteps up there. I kept trying to get you on the radio to ask how you did it, but you weren&amp;rsquo;t answering. I thought you were screwing with me, but I was creeped out. I waited for you outside, and eventually thought to try your phone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thoroughly freaked, but he still had one last detail for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s one more thing,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Remember when I called you, and you asked if I could see you? I did see you. But&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to say anything then, but I could swear I could see people in the third floor windows&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melinda hated driving at night. She did her best to avoid it. Short trips to the store if she just realized she ran out of tampons or had nothing for dinner after getting home — that sort of thing happened now and then. But she did her best not to go out after dark unless someone was coming to pick her up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, naturally, she found herself on the longest drive of her life tonight, with no moon, few stars, swirling clouds above her, and acres of forest on either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As so many unpleasant things in her life, this was her father&amp;rsquo;s fault. She hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen or spoken to the bastard in fifteen years, but just after falling asleep tonight&amp;hellip;no, that was wrong. It would be yesterday by this time. Out of the blue, her phone rang, and his voice was on the other end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I need you, Mellie. Please come, now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;d said just that, and then the line went dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old ass was probably drunk, but he&amp;rsquo;d never called her before — not since she was a child and he was still trying to convince her mother to take him back. It felt like she had been dreaming — waking up to hear his voice again after all these years. It sounded like he was crying. His voice sounded just the same as the last time she&amp;rsquo;d heard it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As though in a dream, she had risen, dressed, and gotten in the car. She was well out of town and halfway to his old place before realizing that she had no way of knowing if he even still lived there. She received updates from her mother from time to time over the years about where he was. The last time she heard from her mother about him was seven years ago. Had he ever stayed in one place that long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to her recollection. She had been seven when her mother finally had enough and showed him the door. Prior to that, a move had come every few months. The house they had been living in was their longest stay in one place; a full sixteen months. It turned into two years after that, and then the next house had been the one she left when she moved out on her own. In all that time, she heard from him sporadically at best, and had finally decided it was best to simply forget about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had found out after a two-hour drive that she had been right to wonder if he was still in the same place. His last known address was a sketchy apartment in a low-income area of the town she had grown up in. Had he been number 24 or number 42? Maybe he was 14. It definitely had a four. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter. His name wasn&amp;rsquo;t on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the buzzers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bastard!&lt;/em&gt; Her drunk of a father had called her at night, all but demanding she come to him for reasons he didn&amp;rsquo;t even feel were important enough to tell her over the phone, and then just expected that she would know where he lived now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a flurry of rage, she turned and marched back to her car, slamming the door and starting off in the direction she came. She was so angry she didn&amp;rsquo;t even look where she was going and missed her turn-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing she knew, she was on this lonely stretch of road. Cars were sparse, but she took some comfort in the fact that she would pass one every half-hour or so. Her dashboard clock now read 2:27 AM. She had been driving for more than five hours since leaving her house. &lt;em&gt;At night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every five minutes or so, she checked her cell phone. Ever since realizing she was lost, she had checked her phone and found no bars at all. She even stopped at a gas station (closed, of course), just sure there should be some service around here somewhere, but nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take stock of your life, Mellie&lt;/em&gt;, she thought. &lt;em&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re over thirty, you hate your job, you and your mother don&amp;rsquo;t get along, you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen or spoken to your father in just under half your life, you have no time for your friends or a relationship thanks to the aforementioned job you hate, and now here you are, trapped on a road you&amp;rsquo;ve never been on before, at night, and you can&amp;rsquo;t even so much as call AMA let alone check Google Maps. Smart lady you are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She briefly considered stopping and flagging down the next car that passed. She quickly realized the futility of that plan. Any car on this road would also have no service. So there was nothing for it. She&amp;rsquo;d have to drive until she saw a house. She&amp;rsquo;d feel bad for waking someone up, but there was no choice. She needed to find her way back to the main highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so far, all that she could see on either side was trees. Mile after mile of trees. No lights shining through the boughs. No sign that anyone had ever been here before except that there was a road and people were obviously still driving on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t even any road signs other than the mile markers. Had she really found the middle of nowhere? She was just in the middle of this thought when her headlights illuminated something just up the road; a square, wooden sign — obviously made by someone other than the government. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a gas/food/lodging sign, or a mile marker, or a distance-to sign. This looked like the kind of signs advertising a private business was nearby. She slowed down to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Granny Royce&amp;rsquo;s Road House&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Come stay the night at Granny&amp;rsquo;s!&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;ll take good care of you!&lt;br&gt;
Room! Board! Low Prices!&lt;br&gt;
Next Exit!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her heart sped up. She certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in spending a night at Granny Royce&amp;rsquo;s, but every business had a phone. At the very least, she&amp;rsquo;d have a map, or know the way back to the highway. She decided she would stop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She almost missed the turn. Granny Royce&amp;rsquo;s Road House was buried at the back of a long, dirt driveway, secluded amid the trees. She was almost past the little dirt &amp;ldquo;road&amp;rdquo; that led back to it before realizing it was there. She skidded to a stop and turned in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little house lay ahead. It was two stories and looked to have about eight to ten rooms. Big for a home but small for anything announcing room and board. She got closer and looked for a vacancy sign. Nothing. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that the sign wasn&amp;rsquo;t lit; there was no sign. The porch light was on and the front of the building was illuminated by that light and by her headlights. No signs of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She almost wondered if she&amp;rsquo;d gotten the wrong place, but she was certain that she had seen no other exits between this house and the sign announcing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She paused in the driveway and took out her cell again. Still no service. She did a quick search for any available wireless signals. To her complete lack of surprise, there were none. Not even any secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no one here but me&lt;/em&gt;, she thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised to find the house empty as well. But the light was on and this was supposed to be a road house. Someone would be manning the front desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got out of the car and headed for the front porch. As she turned around to make sure the lights flashed when she hit the lock button on her fob, she thought she could see a flash of movement in the trees. Something human-shaped. She stopped and looked again. Nothing. She decided she imagined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the front door, she hesitated. If it really was a road house then she should be able to just go on in. But what if she got the wrong house? If she tried the door and just walked in, she could find herself arrested out here in Buttfuck, Nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cautiously, she tried the knob. It turned. She pressed gently on the door. It opened. Relief flooded through her when she saw that she was in a small, but tastefully decorated foyer that had obviously been repurposed as an admissions area. A quaint desk with an honest-to-god guest book had been placed in the far right corner and some chairs had been set out, along with magazines on a table. She read the titles briefly—&lt;em&gt;Mademoiselle&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blue Book&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New Country Life&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Arts &amp;amp; Architecture&lt;/em&gt;—before turning her attention to the little desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a computer. That was a cute touch. It was like the house was from a past era. Perhaps old Granny Royce really didn&amp;rsquo;t like modern technology. There was, however, a little bell, just like there would have been in 1929. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t even the round silver kind you slapped to ring; it was a little porcelain hand-bell. This place was starting to out-cute her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please let her have a phone, and please let it use the numberplan, not 50s exchanges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She picked up the bell and gave it a shake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, nothing happened. Then she saw a light come on in the back room and the shadow of an old woman sprang up on the wall. The shadow moved toward her and within a few seconds, she saw its owner: Granny Royce, who perhaps looked like every grandmother in every storybook ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, goodness me,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;My lands. Good morning deary. Pardon my tardiness but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we got guests at this hour. Can I take your name, honey?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granny Royce was smallish, her grey hair tied in a neat bun behind her head, a dress that would have looked like it belonged to a senior citizen in the twenties, and a faded pink sweater. Melinda thought that she looked just like she would have wanted her own grandmother to look like, but her mother&amp;rsquo;s mother had died when she was young, and she&amp;rsquo;d never met her father&amp;rsquo;s mother. It almost hurt to deny this sweet little woman her business, but nevertheless, she had to get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry,&amp;rdquo; she began. &amp;ldquo;But the fact is I&amp;rsquo;m lost. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure where I am in the direction of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, you poor thing,&amp;rdquo; said Granny Royce. &amp;ldquo;You just sit down and let me fix you some tea, or something. You must be cold.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Really, thank you, but I&amp;rsquo;m okay,&amp;rdquo; Melinda said gently. &amp;ldquo;I just need to use the phone, if I could, or if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a map, even that would be lovely. I really only live a couple of hours from here&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She trailed off, not knowing if she was even right about that. She easily could have driven those five-plus hours in the wrong direction entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh dear,&amp;rdquo; said the little woman sadly. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, honey, but the phone lines are down. As for a map, well&amp;hellip;I used to have one, and if I look I still might, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably quite out of date by now. The highway moved since then, I know that much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melinda&amp;rsquo;s heart sank. How could her luck get any worse? No phone, cell or land line, and no map. What could she do? She had to get back home. She was expected to work at 8 AM tomorrow. And why were the phone lines down? The weather was coldish but clear. Were they fixing a line nearby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told Granny Royce the name of her town, but Granny only said &amp;ldquo;Believe it or not, I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of that town. What did you say the name was?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told her again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, doesn&amp;rsquo;t ring a bell. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. But I could not say which direction it&amp;rsquo;s in. Why don&amp;rsquo;t you stay the night, sweetie. I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a discount for your trouble.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you. That&amp;rsquo;s very kind of you. But I have work tomorrow and I need to get back home. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure why I&amp;rsquo;m out tonight. The only reason I had doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Honey, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t advise trying to drive back that far tonight,&amp;rdquo; Granny Royce said. &amp;ldquo;Why, it&amp;rsquo;s almost three in the morning, and you&amp;rsquo;ve not had any sleep. Maybe the lines will be up in the morning, and you can call your work and let them know you&amp;rsquo;ll be late.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That won&amp;rsquo;t work, either,&amp;rdquo; she replied. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the opener. No one will be there. No, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I&amp;rsquo;ve really got to leave. I&amp;rsquo;ll head in the other direction until I find the road I was on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that, Granny Royce&amp;rsquo;s expression, already one of kind concern, seemed to shift somewhat — to one of fear. She paused, looking at Melinda as though she wanted to say something else to keep her inside. Finally she said, reluctantly, &amp;ldquo;Alright, honey, if you&amp;rsquo;re sure. Just you be careful, now. Don&amp;rsquo;t speak to nobody until you&amp;rsquo;re back on the road.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last warning seemed a little silly. After all, what was Melinda, a little girl? She thanked Granny Royce for her kindness and headed back to the car. About halfway to the car she remembered thinking she saw something moving in the trees. Her eyes scanned both sides of the secluded little cleared area she was in, looking for anything that appeared to be moving on its own rather than being blown by the slight wind. She saw nothing. Satisfied, she headed for her car. All four tires were flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goddammit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She leaned down and saw long slash marks on each tire. Someone in this little slice of &lt;em&gt;Green Acres&lt;/em&gt; had slashed her tires in the time it took her to find out that she had no way of contacting anyone tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids from a local farmhouse, gotta be&lt;/em&gt;, she thought grimly. &lt;em&gt;Nothing else to do, so you might as well go out at night and slash tires.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stopped and let the reality sink in. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere tonight. She had no choice now; she had to stay the night here until morning, when hopefully the phone lines would be up and she could call someone from work to ask them to go in for her, and then AMA to get her tires dealt with. She sighed and walked back in the house. She could hear Granny Royce as she was walking back to her room. She had already turned off the lights. Resigned to her fate, Melinda rang the little bell again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That you, miss?&amp;rdquo; she heard Granny Royce call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s me,&amp;rdquo; she answered. &amp;ldquo;Sorry to be a bother. My name is Melinda Orton. Sorry I never mentioned it before. I guess I will take a room for the night, if the offer&amp;rsquo;s still good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, of course it is, deary,&amp;rdquo; said Granny Royce, re-entering the room and turning the lights back on. &amp;ldquo;Melinda. Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s such a pretty name, honey. Well. Let&amp;rsquo;s get you situated. You put your name and arrival time in the book there and I&amp;rsquo;ll get you a key. All the boarding rooms are on the second floor, and there&amp;rsquo;s only a couple left.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are others here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was surprising. Not a single car had been in the front lawn when she pulled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, yes, Miss Melinda.&amp;rdquo; Granny was puttering around in the adjacent room. &amp;ldquo;Mr. Norris, young Calvin, there&amp;rsquo;s a few of us here.&amp;rdquo; She came back out with a key in her hand. &amp;ldquo;Just out of curiosity, what made you change your mind?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seemed to brighten as she asked the question, as though relieved that Melinda would stay after all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s probably just local kids getting kicks,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;But I found my tires slashed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granny stopped suddenly, her face twisted with concern and worry. Then she resumed, as though nothing was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nothing to be done for it, I suppose,&amp;rdquo; she said, with an err of sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, not until morning, at any rate,&amp;rdquo; said Melinda. &amp;ldquo;Then hopefully the lines will be up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh,&amp;rdquo; said Granny Royce, distractedly. &amp;ldquo;Yes, hopefully.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She led Melinda up the darkened staircase into an empty, quiet hall. Or perhaps not so quiet. From one end of the hall came the muffled sound of someone crying. Whoever it was was crying softly — not with anger or petulance or fear, but with deep sadness. It sounded as if crying was something this person was used to, but they were still unable to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who is that?&amp;rdquo; she asked, pointing in the direction the crying was coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, pay that no mind, honey,&amp;rdquo; said Granny. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s just Mr. Norris. He&amp;rsquo;s been like that a while. Older man, you understand. Not all there.&amp;rdquo; She tapped her temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I understand,&amp;rdquo; Melinda replied, but wondered privately how an old, out-of-touch man would wind up at a road house. &amp;ldquo;Has he been here long?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A while, I&amp;rsquo;d say,&amp;rdquo; answered Granny. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t really recall how long, exactly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does he pay for room and board&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I guess he doesn&amp;rsquo;t drive,&amp;rdquo; she said to the old woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Actually, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like anyone else here has a car.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granny started at this, looking up with an almost guilty expression. &amp;ldquo;Oh, well,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;That kind of thing is the business of the guests. I don&amp;rsquo;t ask about such things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned the key in the lock of the room she had led Melinda to, and opened the door. Turning on the light, she showed Melinda the quaint little room. Melinda thought it looked like stepping into the past. She could swear this room would have looked modern in the early fifties, at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come to think of it, so could the rest of this place&lt;/em&gt;, she thought. &lt;em&gt;No wireless service, no computer, that old bell. And those magazines, they looked new, but&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That thought was cut off as Granny put the key on the nightstand and started in with instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now, the bathroom is down the hallway there. You&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing with the whole floor, so please bare that in mind if you have to go. There&amp;rsquo;s a shower schedule on the door, as well. First come, first serve. You just add your name to the first available line and that&amp;rsquo;s the order the showers are in. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry about that if I were you, though. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll be first in line. I get up at 6 AM sharp every morning and start breakfast, but you come on down whenever you&amp;rsquo;re ready and I&amp;rsquo;ll whip something up for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, and one last thing, my dear. I would strongly advise you not to leave the house until sun-up. You just never know what could happen out there. In the dark.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of course,&amp;rdquo; she replied. &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d never go out there in the dark if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stopped that train of thought right out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few moments, she was alone. Alone, without anything to wear to bed, and nothing to shower, brush her teeth, or hair with in the morning. She sat on the bed and looked out the window, which faced front. Her car still sat where she had left it, the only thing for miles that seemed like part of her world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And an expensive, over-large paperweight until I can get a hold of someone&lt;/em&gt;, she thought bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the homeyness of the room, she felt an unwillingness to rise and shut off the light. Somehow the thought of going to sleep in this backward little room seemed unthinkable. So instead, she continued to sit and stare out the window. A figure in black detached itself from the shadows of the trees and made its way to her car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hell?!&lt;/em&gt; She jumped up and ran at the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure was tall, and seemed to be wearing a cloak made of night. She saw as its arm extended. In its hand was a long, jagged dagger. It dragged the dagger across the side of her car, leaving a long gash-mark in the paint and metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; she shouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure kept dragging the dagger. She reached for the window to open it. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t budge. She looked for a lock, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t see one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; she yelled again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the figure raised its head. She could see the glint of two eyes under the hood. The figure raised the dagger, slowly, determinedly. It pointed it straight at her face. She leaped away from the window and ran for the door. A noise on the other side stopped her. Footsteps. Dragging, shambling footsteps. And crying. The sound of a person for whom deep, longing sadness is a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Norris!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She waited. Somehow, she just felt that she should let the old man pass before she opened the door. Before he got very far, however, she heard other footsteps - these much quicker and lighter — run up the stairs and stop near the door of her room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Stop it!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; hissed Granny Royce. &amp;ldquo;Go back in your room right now! You know better. She can&amp;rsquo;t see you yet. Hopefully she won&amp;rsquo;t have to at all. Now you go back in there. You&amp;rsquo;ve got no business being out at this hour anyway.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What on Earth?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could that sweet old woman talk to another human that way, let alone an old man with a foggy mind? She almost opened the door right then, but somehow her hand stopped, and waited until the shuffling, crying man had made his way back down the hallway. She heard his door open. She opened her own door just in time to see his foot, shod in a well-worn house-shoe, slide into his room. The door closed softly after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That poor man&lt;/em&gt;, she thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now she was determined to find out what was going on. The punk outside in the Halloween costume slashing up her car followed by Granny yelling at an old man made her begin to understand that not all was well here. She went back down to the front desk area, which was completely unlit except for the moonlight and porch light coming through the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, however, a light on near the back room that Granny Royce had emerged from before. Melinda paused to take a look outside the front window. The maniac with the dagger was nowhere to be seen for the moment, but she was now determined that it was he that she had seen moving through the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He could have killed me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She strode in the direction of the light, seeing that it was the light to the kitchen. She kept going, expecting to find Granny Royce still puttering about with whatever an old inn-keeper did with herself during the early hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she found Granny sitting with a young man of about twenty. He had dark hair and a scruff of stubble and was wearing a dark brown corduroy shirt and khaki&amp;rsquo;s, along with a pork-pie hat. He looked like he was ready to go sell newspapers on a street-corner in the thirties. He was quietly sipping tea while Granny was admonishing him from the other end of the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now that was a horrible thing to say!&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;When I was your age, young men minded their manners!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a laugh, talking about my age,&amp;rdquo; muttered the young man with a sneer. &amp;ldquo;And just how old are you? Do you even remember?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Calvin Davidson, you are trouble, young man,&amp;rdquo; she hissed back. Neither had noticed Melinda yet. &amp;ldquo;One of these days you&amp;rsquo;re going to say something you&amp;rsquo;ll regret.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, come on, Granny, what could I possibly say that will make things worse than they already are?&amp;rdquo; demanded Calvin. &amp;ldquo;I mean, look at old Mr. Norris up there! Both of us are ol&amp;hellip;um, hullo, miss. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know we had anyone else here.&amp;rdquo; He had just seen Melinda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Uh, hi,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had the feeling she&amp;rsquo;d walked in on an old argument the two of them had had many times, and that did not concern her. Her fear and anger were forgotten for the moment. Calvin had been talking to Granny like a sullen kid, but something about what they were saying seemed&amp;hellip;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can I help you, Melinda?&amp;rdquo; asked Granny Royce. &amp;ldquo;Is there something wrong with your room?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brought her back. &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;The room is fine. But nothing else is! I mean, what on Earth do you even have a road house out here where it seems like no one ever stops? Why are most of the rooms full even though mine is the only car out there? Why did I hear you talking to Mr. Norris like he was a dog? And why would you want to make sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t see him?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got no further before Calvin cut her off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good lord, she&amp;rsquo;s not even been here a night and she can see it. Why did you even let her in, Granny? Why don&amp;rsquo;t you just bolt the door? Hell, if I could go take down that sign don&amp;rsquo;t you think I would have, by now? Lord love a duck.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something you don&amp;rsquo;t hear many young men say&lt;/em&gt;, thought Melinda. She decided to ignore Calvin for the moment, otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And besides that, there&amp;rsquo;s someone out there! He&amp;rsquo;s the freak who slashed my tires and he&amp;rsquo;s been out there messing up my car since then! And you can&amp;rsquo;t even call the police! Are you gonna tell me you&amp;rsquo;ve never had vandals out here before?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a long pause in the room. Neither Granny nor Calvin seemed willing to break it. Calvin scratched at his neck. For the first time, Melinda noticed a red slash at his throat, half-hidden by his collar. It looked like either a very fresh scar or a slightly healed wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen, miss, I don&amp;rsquo;t know your name,&amp;rdquo; he finally said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Melinda,&amp;rdquo; she told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Melinda,&amp;rdquo; he repeated. &amp;ldquo;Melinda, I think you should sit down. I have to tell you something that you may find&amp;hellip;troubling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melina did not like how he said that. She also didn&amp;rsquo;t like the way his tone had switched from sullen child to serious adult. He looked several years her junior but he was talking to her like he was her uncle, or her boss. He swallowed a sip of tea and sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he looked her straight in the face and said: &amp;ldquo;The reason I don&amp;rsquo;t have a car out there is that when I got here, no one my age, no one in my line of work, would have owned a car. It would have seemed like an impossible dream.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;hellip;what are you talking about?&amp;rdquo; she asked, hesitantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I worked in a textile mill,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The mill was shut down by the time I got here. Most businesses were. So I struck out on my own; a drifter looking for what work I could find. And I stopped here. Forever.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Businesses were shut down&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand,&amp;rdquo; said Melinda. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re having a rough time of it right now, but businesses are mostly staying open&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not then, they weren&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; said Calvin, sadly. &amp;ldquo;I arrived here&amp;hellip;in 1929.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melinda blinked. Something had exploded behind her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This place was new then,&amp;rdquo; said Granny. &amp;ldquo;My man and I had just opened it. And young Mr. Calvin was a sweet young lad of sixteen. I offered to take him on as hired help over my husband&amp;rsquo;s objections. Well, my husband was a well-meaning man, but he knew how to pinch a penny. T&amp;rsquo;was a year after I took Calvin on that Mr. Royce died. Calvin and I have been here ever since. And every few years or so, someone joins us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yep,&amp;rdquo; Calvin broke in. &amp;ldquo;Miss Tillie was first; she was a woman of ill repute who ran here, pregnant and scared that the man who&amp;rsquo;d run her trade up in New York was gonna find her and kill her. She and that baby&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He broke off, now seeming on the point of tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And then,&amp;rdquo; said Granny, &amp;ldquo;there was Mr. Standish. He was a traveling minister. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t travel anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr. Norris got here in &amp;lsquo;69,&amp;rdquo; said Calvin. &amp;ldquo;His story is probably the worst. He was a&amp;hellip;well, he was a bank-robber, you see. Carried a pistol. And he didn&amp;rsquo;t like learning how long we&amp;rsquo;d all been here.&amp;rdquo; He paused, stood and walked to the kitchen window. &amp;ldquo;He tried to leave on his own, you see. He ain&amp;rsquo;t the first to try it. That was me, actually. I warned him not to try, but he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t listen. But when he got outside&amp;hellip;and he met &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Calvin!&amp;rdquo; hissed Granny. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t talk about this!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s gotta know,&amp;rdquo; said Calvin. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s no point in her finding out slowly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s still a chance for her!&amp;rdquo; said Granny in a stage whisper. &amp;ldquo;All she has to do is wait until morning&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s not going to wait until morning,&amp;rdquo; said Calvin with some remorse in his voice. &amp;ldquo;No one ever waits until morning. The fact that she came down here is proof enough of that. Besides, what good would that have really done her? Her car is useless. We have no phones here. There was no phone when this place went up and there won&amp;rsquo;t never be a phone here. You know that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay, everyone, stop!&amp;rdquo; Melinda shouted. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s enough! Now, you can&amp;rsquo;t keep me prisoner here and I have no intention of staying any longer. Only that knife-wielding maniac out there is keeping me from running up the road this minute! Now, I need to know what&amp;rsquo;s really going on here and I need to know it now!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve been telling you,&amp;rdquo; Calvin said. &amp;ldquo;Granny may not want you to know everything, but you need to. Because you won&amp;rsquo;t be leaving. Oh, we&amp;rsquo;re not trying to keep you prisoner. I don&amp;rsquo;t even care if you run out that door right now. But you&amp;rsquo;ll never leave this house again afterward.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like hell I won&amp;rsquo;t!&amp;rdquo; yelled Melinda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen, child!&amp;rdquo; said Granny, rising from her spot at the table. &amp;ldquo;Listen, please! None of us mean you harm, my dear, not even Mr. Norris. There&amp;rsquo;s scant he can do anymore, and he knows it. That&amp;rsquo;s why he&amp;rsquo;s up there crying all the time. But we&amp;rsquo;re stuck here, all of us. I hoped there was a chance for you to run for it in the morning, but Calvin&amp;rsquo;s right. There&amp;rsquo;s no guarantee you&amp;rsquo;d be safe in the morning, anyhow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;hellip;the&amp;hellip;&lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;is wrong with this place!?&amp;rdquo; choked out Melinda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was beginning to break down. she could feel the tears welling in her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was about a month after Mr. Royce died,&amp;rdquo; said Calvin. &amp;ldquo;When &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; came. He was wearing that long, black robe and carrying that ridiculous dagger. I saw him when I was trimming the hedges in the back. I told him he needed to get out of here, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t like his look. He&amp;hellip;he moved so fast I never saw it coming. And he got me, from here&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Calvin touched his neck. &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;to here.&amp;rdquo; He touched his lower abdomen on the opposite side from the neck slash. He began to undo his shirt. Melinda almost vomited. Under his shirt was a long, ugly slash that went deep&amp;hellip;and was still seeping blood. She could see bone, muscle and intestines wriggling within that mangled ruin. &amp;ldquo;I died that night,&amp;rdquo; said Calvin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But then I didn&amp;rsquo;t. The next thing I knew, I was being dragged into the house by Granny, and when I woke up, I nearly scared her to death. She was sure that I was gone. The thing is, I was. But I was awake. I could talk, walk, do anything I could while alive. Well, except take any enjoyment or nourishment from food or drink anymore. I still drink that tea because it keeps my skin from turning ash-grey. I learned that about fifty years ago.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t go away, though,&amp;rdquo; Granny broke in. &amp;ldquo;I went out to deal with him, carrying my axe. He took my axe and buried it in my back. I won&amp;rsquo;t show you the wound, honey. Calvin shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have shown you his, either. No one should have to see it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But that&amp;rsquo;s how &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; works, Melinda,&amp;rdquo; continued Calvin. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s got that knife, but if you try to use a weapon on him, he just&amp;hellip;moves like he does and takes it from you. You never stand a chance. He&amp;rsquo;ll use whatever weapon you try to take him down with to end you. Mr. Norris learned that the hard way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This&amp;hellip;this is not happening!&amp;rdquo; Melinda was ready to break down. She had to hold it together. She had to get out of here, somehow. Nothing about this was right. Nothing about it could be real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all a dream; too much didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. Her father calling her out of the blue. Her leaving to go to him without a second thought. Getting lost so quickly, and so irreversibly. No cell phone service anywhere on this road. This place, everything about it! She was dreaming; that had to be it. But if so, she was going to survive this dream. She turned and ran for the stairs. Her purse was still in her room, but she was going to grab it and go. She&amp;rsquo;d had enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesting voices began babbling behind her; she cared not one whit. Mr. Norris was waiting at the top of the stairs. Contrary to Granny Royce&amp;rsquo;s description of him, he was not old at all. No more than about forty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she saw instantly what she meant by &amp;ldquo;not all there&amp;rdquo;. The top half of Mr. Norris&amp;rsquo;s head looked normal, like a reasonably attractive man with dark hair peppered with grey here and there. His eyes, a clear green, were moist with fresh tears. The lower half of his face was a ruin of bone fragments, shredded muscle and blood. So much blood. His left side was similarly destroyed. His arm hung on a few hanging strings of muscle, his hip was just as much a mess of bone and blood as his face was. He kept his one good hand on the bannister as he shuffled toward her. Behind him stood a young woman in a bra and a pair of panties. Her stomach was cut open, and looking out of the wound with bright, intelligent eyes was the mangled remains of a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melinda turned and bolted for the front door. Her hand had just closed around the knob when Calvin rushed up to her, placing his freezing cold hand over hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re not going to hurt you,&amp;rdquo; he said quickly. &amp;ldquo;But &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; will. If you step out for so much as a moment, &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; will kill you, and it will hurt. And it will go on hurting. Forever. After a while you learn to function with the pain, but it never goes away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sobbing, she asked the question she&amp;rsquo;d been afraid to ask since coming here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who is &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; said Granny, from behind Calvin. &amp;ldquo;He just&amp;hellip;came here, and he won&amp;rsquo;t go away. He likes to watch us, and do things to incite us to come out again. As soon as someone does, he hurts them more. But no matter how many times he kills us, we &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t die&lt;/em&gt;. Believe me when I say, we all wish we could.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melinda had had enough of this. She pushed Calvin away and threw open the door. &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; was standing on the porch. The knife was held out in front of him, just at face-level. Melinda ran into him at a rush, the knife puncturing her right eye and its tip sliding on through, out the other side. She just managed to see the grinning, pure-white face of her killer, before everything went black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, the house erupted with screams from upstairs as Melinda awoke to a world of pain, the like of which she&amp;rsquo;d never known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Abandoned by Disney</title>

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may have heard that the Disney corporation is responsible for at least one real, &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; Ghost Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney built the &amp;ldquo;Treasure Island&amp;rdquo; resort in Baker&amp;rsquo;s Bay in the Bahamas. It didn&amp;rsquo;t START as a ghost town! Disney&amp;rsquo;s cruise ships would actually stop at the resort and leave tourists there to relax in luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a FACT. Look it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney blew $30,000,000 on the place… yes, Thirty Million Dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they abandoned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney blamed the shallow waters (too shallow for their ships to safely operate) and there was even blame cast on the workers, saying that since they were from the Bahamas, they were too lazy to work a regular schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where the factual nature of their story ends. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of sand, and it obviously wasn&amp;rsquo;t because &amp;ldquo;foreigners are lazy&amp;rdquo;. Both are convenient excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I sincerely doubt those reasons were legitimate. Why don&amp;rsquo;t I buy the official story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of Mowgli&amp;rsquo;s Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the beachside city of Emerald Isle in North Carolina, Disney began construction of &amp;ldquo;Mowgli&amp;rsquo;s Palace&amp;rdquo; in the late 1990s. The concept was a Jungle-themed resort with a large, you guessed it, PALACE in the center of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with the character of Mowgli, then you might better rememeber the story &amp;ldquo;The Jungle Book&amp;rdquo;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it anywhere else, you&amp;rsquo;d know it as the Disney cartoon from decades past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mowgli is an abandoned child, in the jungle, essentially raised by animals and simultaniously threatened/pursued by other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mowgli&amp;rsquo;s Palace was a controversial undertaking from the start. Disney bought up a ton of high-priced land for the project, and there was actually a scandal surrounding some of the purchases. The local Government claimed &amp;ldquo;eminent domain&amp;rdquo; on people&amp;rsquo;s homes, then turned around and sold the properties to Disney. At one point a home that had just been constructed was immediately condemned with little to no explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land grabbed by the Government was supposedly for some fictional highway project. Knowing full well what was going on, people started calling it &amp;ldquo;Mickey Mouse Highway&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the concept art. A group of stuffed shirts from Disney Co. actually held a city meeting. They intended to sell everyone on how lucrative this project was going to be for everyone. When the showed the concept art, this gigantic Indian Palance… surrounded by JUNGLE… staffed with men and women in loincloths and tribal gear… well, suffice to say everyone flipped their shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re talking about a large Indian Palace, Jungle, and Loincloths not only in the center of a relatively wealthy area, but also a somewhat &amp;ldquo;xenophobic&amp;rdquo; area of the southern USA. It was a questionable mix at that point in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One member of the crowd tried to storm the stage, but he was quickly subdued by security after he managed to break one of the presentation boards over his knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney took that community and essentially broke it over its knee, as well. The houses were razed, the land was cleared, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a damned thing anyone could do or say about it. Local TV and Newspapers were against the resort at the beginning, but some insane connection between Disney&amp;rsquo;s media holdings and the local venues came into play and their opinions turned on a dime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, Treasure Island, the Bahamas. Disney sunk those millions in and then split. The same thing happened with Mowgli&amp;rsquo;s Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction was complete. Visitors actually stayed at the resort. The surrounding communities were flooded with traffic and the ususal annoyances associated with an influx of lost and irate tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it all just stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney shut it down and nobody knew what the Hell to think. But they were pretty happy about it. Disney&amp;rsquo;s loss was pretty hilarious and wonderful to a large group of folks who didn&amp;rsquo;t want this in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t give the place another thought since hearing it closed over a decade ago. I live maybe four hours from Emarald Isle, so really I only heard the rumblings and didn&amp;rsquo;t experience any of it first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I read this article from someone who had explored the Treasure Island resort and posted a whole blog about all the crazy shit he found there. Stuff just… left behind. Things smashed, defaced, probably ruined by the disgruntled former employees who had lost their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, the locals from all around probably had a hand in wrecking that place. People there felt just as angry about Treasure Island as folks here did about Mowgli&amp;rsquo;s Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus there were rumors that Disney had released their aquarium &amp;ldquo;stock&amp;rdquo; into the local waters when they closed… including sharks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to take a few swings at some merchandise after that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what I&amp;rsquo;m getting at is that this blog about Treasure Island got me thinking. Even though many years had passed since its closing, I figured it might be cool to do some &amp;ldquo;Urban Exploration&amp;rdquo; at Mowgli&amp;rsquo;s Palace. Take some photos, write about my experience, and probably see if there was anything I could take home as a memento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to say I wasted no time in getting there, because honestly it took me another year after I first found that Treasure Island article to get around to going up to Emerald Isle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of that year, I did a lot of research on the Palace resort… or rather, I tried to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, no official Disney site or resource made any mention of the place. That had been scrubbed clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even odder, however, was that nobody before myself had apparently thought to blog about the place or even post a photo. None of the local TV or Newspaper sites had one word about the place, though that was to be expected since they had all swung Disney&amp;rsquo;s way. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be out there lauding their embarassment, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I learned that corporations can actually ask Google, for example, to remove links from search results… basically for no good reason. Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s probably not that nobody spoke of the resort, but rather their words were made ineaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end I could barely find the place. All I had to go on was an old-as-hell map I&amp;rsquo;d recieved in the mail back in the 90s. It was a promotional item sent out to people who had recently been to Disney world, and I guess since I had been there in the late 80s, that was &amp;ldquo;recent&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really intend to hang onto it. It just got shoved in with my books and comics from my childhood. I&amp;rsquo;d only remembered it months into my research, and even then it took me another few weeks to locate the storage bin my parents had shoved it all into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I DID find it. Locals were no help, as most were transplants who had moved to the beach in recent years… or old residents who just sneered at me and made rude gestures the second I managed to say &amp;ldquo;Where would I find Mowgli&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive took me through an inordinately long corridor of overgrowth. Tropical plants that had run rampant and overpopulated the area mixed with the native species of flora that actually BELONGED there and had tried to reclaim the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in awe when I reached the front gates of the resort. Tremendous, monolithic wooden gates whose supports to either side looked like they must&amp;rsquo;ve been cut from giant sequoias. The gate itself had been gouged in several places by woodpeckers and eaten away at the base by burrowing insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanging on the gate was a sheet of metal, some random scrap, with hand-painted letters scrawled in black. &amp;ldquo;ABANDONED BY DISNEY&amp;rdquo;. Clearly the handiwork of some past local or an employee who wanted to make some small protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gates were open enough to walk through, but not drive, so grabbing my digital camera and the map, whose flip-side showed a layout of the resort, I set off on foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inner grounds of the place were just as overgrown as the entryway. Palm tree stood untended and ragged among piles of their own coconuts. Banana plants similarly stood in their own stinking, bug-riddled refuse. There was this sort of clash between order and chaos, as carefully planted rows of perrenial flowers mixed with obnoxious tall weeds and stinking, blackened mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that remained of any outdoor structures were broken, rotting wood and various charred bits of unidentifiable material. What was most likely an information booth or an outdoor bar was now simply a pile of assorted debrid chopped up by past vandalism and ravaged by weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing on the grounds was a statue of Baloo, the friendly bear from the Jungle Book, which stood in a sort of courtyard in front of the main building. He was frozen in a jovial wave toward no one, staring into empty space with a silly, toothy grin as bird shit covered whole swaths of his &amp;ldquo;fur&amp;rdquo; and vines ensnared his platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached the main building&amp;mdash;the PALACE&amp;mdash;only to find the outside of the building covered in grafitti where the orginal paint hadn&amp;rsquo;t peeled and chipped away. The front doors weren&amp;rsquo;t just open, they had been taken off their hinges and were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above the front doors, or the gaping maw where they had been, someone had once again painted &amp;ldquo;ABANDONED BY DISNEY&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you about all the awesome stuff I saw inside the Palance. Forgotten statues, abandoned cash registers, a full-fledged secret society of homeless bums… but no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside of the building was so stark, so bare, that I actually think people had stolen the moulding off the walls. Anything that was too big to steal… counters, desks, giant fake trees… they were all resting amid this empty echo chamber that amplified my every step like a slow rat-a-tat of a machine gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the floorplan and headed to all the locations that might seem in any way interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kitchen was as you&amp;rsquo;d imagine… an industrial food prep area with all the appliances and space, no expenses spared. Every glass surface was broken, every door knocked off its hinges, every metal surface kicked and dented. The entire place smelled like very old piss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The huge freezer, not even remotely cool now, had row upon row of empty shelf space. Hooks hung from the ceiling, probably for hanging cuts of meat, and as I stood inside for a momeny, I notced they were swinging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each hook swung in a random direction, but their movements were so slow and small that it was almost impossible to see. I figured it had been caused by my footsteps, so I stopped one from swinging by clutching it in my fist, then carefully letting go, but within seconds it started to swing once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public bathrooms were in much the same state as the rest of the place. Just like the treasure island resort, someone had methodically smashed each porcelain commode with coconuts and other impliments. There was about a half inch of rancid, stinking stagnant water on the floor, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t stay there very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s odd is that the toilets and the sinks (and the bidets in the ladies&amp;rsquo; room, yes I went there) all dripped, leaked, or just ran freely. It seemed to me that they should&amp;rsquo;ve shut the water off long, LONG ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of rooms in the resort, but naturally I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to look through them all. The few I did peer into were similarly wrecked, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to find anything there. I thought there was actually a television or radio in one room, as I really think I heard a quiet conversation coming out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it was like a whisper, probably my own breathing echoing in the silence, or just another case of the sound of flowing water playing tricks on the mind, this is what it sounded like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: (short, unknown reply)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: &amp;ldquo;Your father told you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: (unknown reply, or possibly just weeping.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, that sounds ridiculous. I&amp;rsquo;m just telling you what I experienced, why I thought there might&amp;rsquo;ve been something running in that room&amp;mdash;or worse, some vagrants who had holed up there and probably would&amp;rsquo;ve knifed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the front doors of the Palace again, I figured I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found anything of note and had wasted the trip up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I looked out the door, I noticed something interesting in the courtyard that I had apparently missed. Something that would give me at least ONE thing to show for all my trouble, even if it was just a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There as a lifelike statue of a python, maybe fifty feet long, coiled up and &amp;ldquo;sunning&amp;rdquo; itself on a pedestal right in the center of the area. It was almost time for the sun to start setting, so the light fell onto the object in the PERFECT way for a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached the python and snapped a photo. Then I stood on my toes and snapped another. I moved closer again to get the detail of its face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, casually, the python lifted its head, looked directly into my eyes, turned, and slithered off the pedistal, across the grass, and into the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All fifty feet of it. Its head long disappeared into the woods before its tail even left the sunning spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney had released all their exotic animals onto the grounds. Right there on my floorplan map was the &amp;ldquo;Reptile House&amp;rdquo;. I should have known. I&amp;rsquo;d read about the sharks at Treasure Isle, and I should have KNOWN they&amp;rsquo;d done this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was dumbfounded, just utterly stupefied. My mouth must&amp;rsquo;ve been hanging open for the longest time before I came back down to Earth and snapped it shut. I blinked a few times and backed away from where the snake had been, back toward the Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it was totally gone, I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking any chances and backed my way into the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few deep breaths and slaps to my own face to get myself right in the head again after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked for a place to sit down, as my legs were feeling a bit like jelly at this point. Of course, there WAS no place to sit down unless I wanted to recline in the broken glass and dead leaf carpet or haul myself up onto a desk of questionable reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had seen some stairs near the Palace&amp;rsquo;s lobby and decided to go have a seat there until I felt better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staircase was far enough away from the front of the building to be relatively clean, save for a startling accumulation of dust. I pulled a wedge of metal off the wall, once again painted with the &amp;ldquo;ABANDONED BY DISNEY&amp;rdquo; motto I&amp;rsquo;d become accustomed to. I placed the wedge on the stairs and sat on it to keep at least somewhat clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stairway led downward, below ground level. Using my camera flash as a sort of improvised flashlight, I could see that the stair case ended in a metal mesh door with a padlock. A sign on the door… a REAL sign… read &amp;ldquo;MASCOTS ONLY! THANK YOU!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perked up my spirits a little bit, for two reasons. One, a Mascots-Only area would have definately had some interesting stuff back in the day… Two, the padlock was still in place. Nobody had gone down there. Not the vandals, not the looters, nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the one place I could actually &amp;ldquo;explore&amp;rdquo; and perhaps find something interesting to photograph or wantonly steal. I had come to the Palace essentially agreeing with myself that it was okay to take anything I wanted because&amp;mdash;hey&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;abandoned&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much to bust the lock. Well, actually that&amp;rsquo;s wrong. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much to bust the metal plate on the wall that the padlock was hooked to. Time and decay had done most of the work for me, and I was able to bend the metal plate enough to pull the screws out of the wall&amp;mdash;something nobody else had apparently thought of, or hadn&amp;rsquo;t been able to do at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mascots-Only area was a startling and very welcomed change from the rest of the building I&amp;rsquo;d seen. For one, every second or third fluorescent light overhead was illuminated, even though they flickered and faded randomly. Also, nothing had been stolen or broken, even if age and exposure were definately taking their toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables had note pads and pens, there were clocks… even a punch-in clock on the wall complete with filled-out time cards. Chairs were scattered around and there was even a small break room with an old, static-filled television and long rotted-out food and drink on the counters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was like one of those post-apocalypse movies where everything is left in the state of evacuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked the maze-like sub-basement hallways of the Mascots-Only area, the sights just became more and more interesting. As I went further, desks and tables were knocked over, papers scattered and almost melded with the damp floor, and a large carpet of mold was slowly overtaking the real rotting crimson floor-covering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was just sort of &amp;ldquo;squishy&amp;rdquo;. Anything wood disintegrated into mush when I applied even the least amount of force, and clothing items hanging on hooks in one of the rooms simply fell to moist threads if I tried to unhook them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that annoyed me was that the light was becoming more sparse and unreliable as I went further into the dank, suffocating depths of the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I reached a black and yellow striped door with the words &amp;ldquo;CHARACTER PREP 1&amp;rdquo; stenciled on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open at first. I figured this was probably where the costumes were kept, and I definately wanted a photograph of that twisted, stinking mess. Try as I might, whatever angle or trick I tried, the door wouldn&amp;rsquo;t budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until I gave up and started to walk away. That was when there was a slight popping sound and the door creaked open slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside, the room was completely dark. Pitch black. I used the camera flash to look for a light switch on the wall by the door, but there was nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I made my search, I was jarred out of my sense of excitement by a loud electrical buzz. Rows of lights overhead suddenly flashed to life, flickering and fading in and out like the rest I had passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a second for my eyes to adjust, and it seemed like the light was going to just keep getting brighter until all the bulbs exploded… but just when I thought it would reach that critical stage, the lights dimmed a bit and steadied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was exactly as I had pictured it. Various Disney costumes hung on the walls, fully put together like strange cartoon cadavers hung from invisible nooses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an entire rack of loincloths and &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; clothes on hangers toward the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found odd, and what I wanted to photograph right away, was a Mickey Mouse costume at the center of the room. Unlike the other costumes, it was lying on its back in the center of the floor like a murder victim. The fur on the costume was rotten and shedding, creating bare patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was even more odd, however, was the coloring of the costume. It was like a photo negative of the actual Mickey Mouse. Black where he should be white, and white where he should be black. His normally red pants were light blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sight was off-putting enough that I actually postponed photographing the thing until last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a picture of the costumes hanging on the walls. Upward angles, downward angles, side shots to show an entire row of frozen, putrid cartoon faces, some with plastic eyes missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to stage a shot. Just one of the bedraggled character heads on the slick, grimy floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached for the headpiece of a Donald Duck costume and carefully removed it so the thing wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fall apart in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I looked into the face of the wide-eyed, mouldering head, a loud clattering sound made me jump with fright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked down at my feet, and there between my shoes was a human skull. It had fallen out of the mascot head and shattered into pieces at my feet, only the empty face and lower jaw remained, staring up at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped the Duck head immediately, as you&amp;rsquo;d expect, and moved for the door. As I stood in the doorway, I looked back to the skull on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to take a picture of it, you know? I HAD to, for any number of reasons that may seem silly, but only if you don&amp;rsquo;t think it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d need proof of what happened, especially if Disney was going to somehow make this go away. I had no doubt in my mind, right from the start, that even if it was just gross negligence, Disney was RESPONSIBLE for this. THIS was why the resort had closed, and I was the only one outside Disney Co. who knew. ME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when Mickey, that photo negative, opposite-Mickey in the middle of the floor, started to get up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First sitting up, then climbing to its feet, the Mickey Mouse costume… or whoever was inside of it, stood there at the center of the room, its fake face just starting directly at me as I mumbled &amp;ldquo;No…&amp;rdquo; over and over and over…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;float-right&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/abandoned-by-disney/Reverse-mickey.gif&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/abandoned-by-disney/Reverse-mickey.gif&#34;  alt=&#34;Reverse Mickey&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With shaking hands, a violently thrashing heart, and legs that had once again turned to jelly, I managed to lift the camera and aim it at the opposite creature now quietly sizing me up, head tilted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital camera&amp;rsquo;s screen displayed only dead pixels in the shape of the thing. It was a perfect silhouette of the Mickey costume. As the camera moved in my unsteady hands, the dead pixels spread, marring the screen wherever Mickey&amp;rsquo;s outline moved to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the camera died. Went blank and quiet and… broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I raised my eyes once again to the Mickey Mouse costume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey,&amp;rdquo; it said in a hushed, perverted, but perfectly executed Mickey Mouse voice, &amp;ldquo;Wanna see my head come off?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started to pull at its own head, working its clumsy, glove-clad fingers around its neck with clawing, impatient movements similar to a wounded man trying to pull himself free of a predator&amp;rsquo;s jaws…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it worked its digits into its neck… so much blood…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much thick, curdled, yellow blood…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned away as I heard a sickening tearing of cloth and flesh… only cared about getting away. Above the doorway out of this room, I saw the final message clawed into the metal with bone or fingernails…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;ABANDONED BY GOD&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never got the pictures out of the camera. I never wrote the blog entry about it. After I ran from that place, fled for my sanity if not my very life, I knew why Disney didn&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to know about this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;rsquo;t want anyone like me getting in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;rsquo;t want anything like that getting out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;green-text&#34;&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be black and have family down in Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they farm and own a huge amount of land down in Huntsville&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uncle owns a big house and a bunch of trailers they put out in the woods for hunting or camping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;down south cousins suggest that we go out there to camp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;know I&amp;rsquo;m a city kid from Chicago so they tease the fuck out of me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collect food, kill a pig and some chickens, and bring necessities to camp out for a few days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we get to the camp and it&amp;rsquo;s obvious something is weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;air has this weird electric smell like right before a storm, like ozone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we think nothing of it and unpack and go down to a little creek to swim for a few hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all of a sudden some older white guy and a white teenager come out of the bushes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he has a shotgun in the crook of his arm and says hello and asks us what we&amp;rsquo;re doing this far back in the woods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tell him about my uncle, who he knows, and say we&amp;rsquo;re camping out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he tells us we need to be real careful out here and stick together because there was a big animal in the woods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his son, who is my age, asks if he can stay and hang out with us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;he says OK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to stop greentexting because the story is fairly long and the format is harder to write in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we end up playing football. Dicking around with me, there&amp;rsquo;s the white kid &amp;ldquo;Tanner&amp;rdquo;, five of my cousins, and then four of their friends. In total, there were five girls and six boys. We all were around 15-17 and we ended up just dicking the day away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we head back to the camp and pull out some stuff for a campfire, even though the trailers both had kitchenettes. Tanner says that his family&amp;rsquo;s property sits up against my uncle&amp;rsquo;s; he wants to run home and ask his dad if he can come out camping with us. My cousin Rooster says he&amp;rsquo;s going to go with him since it&amp;rsquo;s going to get dark soon. One of the girls also wants to tag along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about 7 o&amp;rsquo;clock, and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to get pretty dark. They grab flashlights and take the trail toward Tan&amp;rsquo;s property. The rest of us chill. We make smores, drink, and kiss on the girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About thirty or forty minutes later, there&amp;rsquo;s the smell of ozone again. You could notice it over the scent of the fire we had started: this really nasty, coppery smell, like right after you&amp;rsquo;ve had a nosebleed and it&amp;rsquo;s stopped. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly like dried blood, but it was that metallic, back-of-your-throat smell. We immediately think that it&amp;rsquo;s some kind of electrical malfunction, or that someone left a hotplate on or some shit. We search the trailers and nothing&amp;rsquo;s on, but we can all smell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, we can hear people booking it down the path toward us. Rooster, Tan, and the girl all come running into the clearing, out of breath. And they don&amp;rsquo;t even break stride; they all run into the trailer, right by where the fire is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all get the fuck outta there and into the trailers. They end up calming down; even Rooster is crying his fucking eyes out at this point. All the while, the fire is guttering lower and lower, so my other cousins say fuck it and are about to go outside to get the generator out of a shed between the trailers. Tanner goes, &amp;ldquo;Fuck no! Lock the front door, ain&amp;rsquo;t nobody else going outside!&amp;rdquo; He&amp;rsquo;s been crying too; his eyes are bloodshot and puffy and his pants are dirty as shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes on to tell us that they went up to his house. His father said sure, he could go out camping, but to make sure they were careful on the way back, and that maybe they should take one of the hunting rifles just in case. Evidently, Tanner had seen something in their yard a few days before. One of their pigs had been ripped up and half eaten. They assumed it was just some big cats or coyotes, even though they don&amp;rsquo;t usually fuck with live animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanner went upstairs, packed his stuff, and told his dad they would be OK without the rifle, because coyotes avoid people. Then they started walking back toward where we were camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooster finally stops crying and shaking; the girl already had, but was now just staring out the window with a dumb look on her face. He says they had gotten halfway into the woods toward the camp when they&amp;rsquo;d started to hear shit in the forest. It was almost pitch black by this time, so they weren&amp;rsquo;t sure at first what the fuck it was. The girl says that she heard something in the bushes right off the trail. They all beamed their flashlights over there and there was someone standing in the woods in a little hollow. Rooster said they shouted at him and told him that he was scaring the fuck out of them and what a dick he was. He says that&amp;rsquo;s when he realized that the guy was facing away from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They keep walking, and they start smelling the nasty coppery ozone smell. They say that they look off into the forest on the opposite side, and there&amp;rsquo;s a dude standing there too, backward, slightly closer to the path. So now they start powerwalking and Tan keeps going, &amp;ldquo;I should have taken the fucking rifle.&amp;rdquo; As they&amp;rsquo;re telling the story, the smell is still super strong, even inside the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that after they started walking faster, a kind of low gibbering had began coming from both sides of the wood. As they booked it back to the trailer, the girl said she flashed her light out to the side of them and saw something jerking itself through the woods. The gibbering just got louder and louder, and when they could see the light from our campfire, something had come out of the woods about 40 yards behind them onto the track. Then they just flat out ran as hard as they could to the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;rsquo;re out in the fucking woods, and we&amp;rsquo;re assuming at this point it&amp;rsquo;s some rednecks or some shit trying to fuck with us. All of a sudden, my other cousin, Junior, starts going on about how he went to school with a native kid that was telling him about the &amp;lsquo;Goatman&amp;rsquo; or some shit. We promptly tell him to shut the fuck up because we don&amp;rsquo;t need any spooky talk right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he just keeps going on and on about how it&amp;rsquo;s the fucking &amp;lsquo;Goatman,&amp;rsquo; and how we&amp;rsquo;re in his woods and blah, blah, blah. Now at the time, I had never heard of this goat man or any of that, but then a couple years ago&amp;mdash;the year before I graduated from college&amp;mdash;I had a Menom for a roommate and I ended up asking him about it. And to sum it up, it&amp;rsquo;s basically a fucking man with the head of a goat, and he can shapeshift and get among groups of people to terrorize them. It&amp;rsquo;s also supposed to be kind of like the Wendigo; it&amp;rsquo;s bad mojo to even talk about and even worse if you see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this back when I was sixteen. So my cousin is going, &amp;ldquo;The goat man&amp;rsquo;s going to get in and fucking get us.&amp;rdquo; The girls are all terrified and my cousins and I are all fucking trying to figure out if it&amp;rsquo;s just some hillbillies or an animal. All of a sudden, the smell just goes away. To this day, I haven&amp;rsquo;t even experienced anything like it. Obviously, smells usually fade away or lessen, but it literally was just there one second and not the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s after an hour, making it around 9 or 10. We&amp;rsquo;ve stopped shitting bricks enough to go back outside and stoke the fire again. We figure it was just some assholes trying to fuck with us, so we don&amp;rsquo;t go back home, because we think if we do, they&amp;rsquo;ll chase us through the woods or some crazy shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing else weird happens that night. We stay another night, and for the main part of that night, nothing happens. But at about 1 in the morning, we&amp;rsquo;re outside getting drunk and telling ghost stories. As someone is finishing some 2spooky story&amp;mdash;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what about&amp;mdash;the smell comes back. It&amp;rsquo;s so fucking strong that one of the girls literally starts vomiting. I stand up, and you can actually feel how clammy the air is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say we should get inside and that this isn&amp;rsquo;t right; we should have just fucking left. We all go back inside, and we&amp;rsquo;re standing around. My cousin keeps going on about how it&amp;rsquo;s the goat man. My other cousin Rooster tries to shut him the fuck up, and all the while, I&amp;rsquo;m just feeling that something is wrong, and I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out what the fuck it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We end up sitting in there for a while. The smell is just as strong, and we&amp;rsquo;re terrified and all huddled in this camper. We end up cooking brats for everybody because nobody wants to go outside. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those packs with four brats. We have a total of 3 packs. I grill them up on the stove and give everybody a hot dog, then get mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, one of my cousins gets up and goes over to the pot to get another one. He starts grumbling about how I got two brats and everybody else only got one, and I look at him like he&amp;rsquo;s fucking stupid. I tell him that everybody only got one because there were only 12 brats, and that if he wanted more, he should open up a new pack and cook some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when the girl that had been out with Rooster and Tan just starts screaming. &amp;ldquo;OH JESUS, OH LORD, GET IT OUT!&amp;rdquo; She&amp;rsquo;s crying and shivering, and then it dawns on the cousin standing up what the fuck is wrong. Me and him both glance around the room, and I feel my heart fucking sink. I run the fuck out of the cabin and the girl runs out with us. The trailer door is banging against the side of the trailer as everybody books it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my cousin&amp;rsquo;s friends ask us what the fuck was wrong. I start counting us. There&amp;rsquo;s only 11 now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I shit you not,&amp;rdquo; my cousin verified. There had been twelve people in the cabin. But being that everybody didn&amp;rsquo;t really know each other well, nobody had noticed the whole fucking time that there was an extra person. And then I realized earlier that I had kind of noticed something was off. You know how when you&amp;rsquo;re just dicking around having a good time that you don&amp;rsquo;t sweat the small shit, and you don&amp;rsquo;t always keep track of certain stuff? I&amp;rsquo;m dead sure that someone else had been in the trailer with us, and that they had been there for at least a fucking day, eating with us. What makes it worse is that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out who it was, because I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone ever actually interacted with the other person/the Goatman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl kept praying to Jesus and we&amp;rsquo;re all sitting outside. Eventually, we get big-ass sticks and go back in the cabin, but there&amp;rsquo;s nobody in there. We count again, and there&amp;rsquo;s 11 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go back into the trailer and lock the door. We explain what the fuck happened&amp;mdash;the girl says that she realized too, and that when she was about to say something, the person sitting next to her had grabbed her leg hard, leaned over toward her, and said something she couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are pretty much scared as fuck as we huddle together, and I fall asleep. When I wake up, the sun is just coming up, and half the people are asleep and the other half are packing our shit up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all want to walk back home, but like four people want to stay until the sun is all the way up. And some people think that we&amp;rsquo;re just fucking around and still want to stay at the trailers. I just want to get the fuck out of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl&amp;rsquo;s name was Keira, the one that the Goatman had touched. Anyway, I asked her if she really thinks it was something bad, and she says she just wants to go home and that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be out in the woods alone for another night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decide to split up; the four that want to go can go, but I have to stay because I have the keys to the cabin and it&amp;rsquo;s my uncle&amp;rsquo;s and I have to lock up. I&amp;rsquo;m super pissed at this point because I feel like people aren&amp;rsquo;t taking this shit seriously, and I definitely didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be out in the woods for another night. I spend the rest of the day trying to convince the rest of the people&amp;mdash;now 4 girls and four guys&amp;mdash;to get the fuck out of dodge. Tanner leaves with them to go get a rifle and says he&amp;rsquo;s going to be back, so there are just 7 of us left by 4 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around 5 PM, he hasn&amp;rsquo;t made it back yet, and we&amp;rsquo;re getting extremely fucking antsy. The only reason I stopped begging them to leave was because he went to get a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 5:30 PM or so, the one cousin that did stay says that the girl Keira is outside. We all look outside, and sure enough, she&amp;rsquo;s standing by the firepit with her back to the cabin. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking to myself, if she was so fucking scared, why the hell would she come back? And then I get this nasty feeling in my gut. Keep in mind, the whole time, the coppery smell has been gone. Now I realize I can smell just a twinge of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this to the rest of them. Everybody&amp;mdash;and these are the people that wanted to stay in the fucking woods after we had the goddamn Goatman in our midst&amp;mdash;is laughing at me and asking if I set this up to scare them. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at them like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not fucking bullshitting you at all right now.&amp;rdquo; I ask them why the fuck would I play like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the girls goes outside to get Keira. She gets halfway to her and stops cold. Keira starts heaving; I don&amp;rsquo;t know how the fuck to describe it. Sort of like if someone with their back turned was laughing without actually making any sound. It was this fact that made me realize there was not a fucking sound in the whole woods; it was dead silent. This was like late September, so it was still fairly hot at the time, but super chilly some days too. And you could usually hear big-ass geese honking, or some kind of birds or squirrels chitchatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I step out the door and tell the girl to come back in the fucking trailer right goddamn now. She backs up into it and we lock the fucking door. We pull down all the shades except one, and put a guy there in a chair to watch &amp;lsquo;Keira&amp;rsquo;. She stands there for another 20 minutes or so. Eventually, the guy turns to say that she&amp;rsquo;s still there, and there&amp;rsquo;s a HUGE fucking bang on the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all jump the fuck up and scramble around the living room of the trailer. The banging is super fucking loud. My cousin is holding one of the girls, the other two are kinda giggling with nervous laughter, and me and the other two guys are shitting brix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we hear Tan. He&amp;rsquo;s screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;LET ME THE FUCK IN, STOP FUCKING PLAYING!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go over to the door and open it, and he stumbles in with a rifle. There&amp;rsquo;s nobody else outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, he had walked up to the campsite. Nothing weird happened in the forest, but he had seen a girl. Mind you, he said it was not Keira standing there. When he had gotten to the edge of the clearing, she had turned toward him with a slack-jawed look and just stared him down, slowly tracking him as he walked around the outside of the clearing towards the camp. He said it wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;rsquo;til he was almost halfway to the trailer that he&amp;rsquo;d realized she was getting closer to him. She had started off by the fire, and without him even seeing her move, she had been turning, inching closer. He said he just ran the rest of the way back to the cabin, thinking it would open. When he got to the door and it was locked, he turned and it was about half the distance to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looks around the room and then gets super pale. He pulls me to the side and whispers in my ear, &amp;ldquo;You know there are only seven of us in here, right?&amp;rdquo; I get that feeling where your stomach drops to your nuts. It had been back inside the trailer while we were sorting out who was going where, and then when we all went outside to talk earlier in the day. It&amp;rsquo;d just slipped right back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look out the window and there is nobody there. So we recount, and then I go over and ask everyone how many people were here earlier. And everybody says 8. I say, &amp;ldquo;Well, how many are here now?&amp;rdquo; They all do the count and realize there are now only seven people in the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan had brought back a couple boxes of ammo and his rifle. He had told his dad that there was some kind of animal in the forest because he didn&amp;rsquo;t think he would believe him if he said it was the Goatman. He says that his cousin is supposed to be coming down in a few hours and that in the morning, we can all go back to his place, and his cousin will drive us home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m really fucking terrified, but I at least feel better because we can be American and shoot the fuck out of whatever it is if it comes back. But then my cousin gets into this huge argument with one of the girls because she thinks that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be funny and prank them. She&amp;rsquo;s getting really scared and thinks I&amp;rsquo;m not funny. He keeps telling her I&amp;rsquo;m not that kind of person, and she says, &amp;ldquo;Well, how do we know the girl wasn&amp;rsquo;t just Tanner in a wig? Or if it&amp;rsquo;s really the Goatman, how do we know that this is the real Tanner and that Goatman just didn&amp;rsquo;t kill Tanner in the woods and take his gun?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we get into a huge fucking argument about this, where me and Tan are like, &amp;ldquo;we could seriously be in danger, because at the very least, someone has been sneaking themselves into our fucking trailer without us knowing and mingling with us, and at worst, something bad is in the forest fucking with us.&amp;rdquo; One of the girls is crying and saying she wants to go right now, and we&amp;rsquo;re trying to tell her we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t because none of us are walking through the woods in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the sun is starting to go down and it&amp;rsquo;s getting a little cloudy out. We eat something and turn on the radio for a while, but we can&amp;rsquo;t really get a station out there with anything decent. So we turn it off at about the time that Tan&amp;rsquo;s cousin shows up. He was like 19, I think. Now the sun is just barely over the horizon and he has one of those heavy duty lantern flashlights and another rifle. He walks up to the trailer and we whisper to Tan, asking if he&amp;rsquo;s sure that&amp;rsquo;s his cousin. He says yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy looks behind him and all around the camp, then walks in. He kind of glances at all of us and looks a little confused. Then he says, &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s your other little buddy at? I figured she would meet me up at the cabin. Is she a little slow or something?&amp;rdquo; He also asked whether we had been cooking blood in the cabin, because it smelled like blood and hot pans all the way up the trail. We are all like fucking &amp;ldquo;NOPE.&amp;rdquo; We ask him what the fuck he&amp;rsquo;s talking about with the girl he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had come down the same trail Tan had been using and found &amp;ldquo;one of youse guy&amp;rsquo;s buddies&amp;rdquo; standing in the middle of the trail, looking at him slack-jawed. He had asked her a bunch of questions, but all she did was just look at him. Then she smiled, and he said he kept walking. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t seem to keep up with him, and kept lagging a little behind. He said he asked her if she was hurt or something, and if she needed any help. But she had continued to stare. Eventually, he turned around a bend in the trail. But when he went back to see if she was okay, the trail was empty. He&amp;rsquo;d assumed she had taken some shortcut through the woods to our trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tell him the whole story of what&amp;rsquo;s been going on. I half expected him to say we were full of shit, but he just listened and then sat down on the couches in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanner&amp;rsquo;s cousin gets back to the girl. He says that when she had kept trying to lag behind him, it had kinda weirded him the fuck out, so he tried to keep her in front of him. But no matter how slow he walked, she was always lagging a little behind. He smelled this nasty smell, and it got stronger as he got to the camp. Eventually, it got really strong. She had said something really low that he didn&amp;rsquo;t catch, and when he had turned around, she had been right the fuck up on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stepped back from her. It was at this point that he asked her if she was okay. If she wasn&amp;rsquo;t, he offered to carry her back the rest of the way. She just kept staring. He said he reached out for her, as in to grab her on the shoulder, but he must have &amp;ldquo;misjudged the distance&amp;rdquo; because she was off to the side of where he had put his hand, like she had moved while he was looking dead at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at this point, we know this shit&amp;rsquo;s real, unless Tan is playing a joke, which we can tell he&amp;rsquo;s not because he&amp;rsquo;s almost pissing his pants. They load up their rifles, we eat some more, and we just kind of sit around until about 11. To this fucking day, every time I think about this, I really pray to God that it&amp;rsquo;s some huge prank that my cousins played on me and just never revealed so I would shit myself for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &amp;lsquo;round 11, the stink of copper turned into an actual gross, blood-like smell, like cooked blood and singed hair. Tan and his cousin, Reese, get the fuck up instantly and grab the rifles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s like a half-knocking, half-clawing at the door, and I shit you not, there&amp;rsquo;s this voice. It sounds like when you see those YouTube cats and dogs whose owners teach them how to &amp;ldquo;talk.&amp;rdquo; It says in this halting, weirdly toned voice, &amp;ldquo;Let me the fuck in, stop fucking playing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made my fucking nuts creep up against my body, and one of the girls just starts crying and calling for Jesus. It was so fucking obviously not a person talking. It didn&amp;rsquo;t have the right cadence. That&amp;rsquo;s some shit that I never realized until that moment, but all people have a certain cadence when they talk, no matter what language. All people have a certain kind of rhythm when talking. This shit didn&amp;rsquo;t have any kind of cadence or rhythm. One of those YouTube cats, that&amp;rsquo;s what the fuck it sounded like outside the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y0CoZoKzt0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; class=&#34;external&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y0CoZoKzt0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounded like this almost, just not funny. Sorry for being on a tangent, but if you can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how this shit sounded, then you can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how fucked up the whole situation was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;rsquo;m in full on terror mode. We keep yelling outside, &amp;ldquo;Who is it? Stop fucking around, man!&amp;rdquo; and it just keeps saying, &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Let me the fuck in&amp;rdquo; for almost 15 minutes. Then the smell goes away for a while, and for the next hour or so, you can hear someone basically creeping around in the woods and shit. Every couple minutes, it comes back to the door and says something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the smell fades away at around 2 in the morning. Reese says, &amp;ldquo;Man, fuck this!&amp;rdquo;, opens the door, and walks outside with his rifle. He fires a shot into the air and says something to the effect of, &amp;ldquo;In the name of Jesus Christ, go away!&amp;rdquo; He fires two more times, and then from the woods, right up against the river across from the trailer, it sounds like something is slowly jibbering and hooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it starts screaming, and it sounds almost like a woman and a cat in a bag screaming together. Like I seriously have never heard any shit like that. We can hear the brush over that way start to shake; Reese fires over into the treeline and then starts backing up into the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lock the door, and we can hear this shit keening and screaming. Reese says something had come out of the bushes, super low to the ground, and was crawling toward the cabin. He had shot at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much, that was how the rest of the night went; literally constant screaming for the next two hours and shit moving out into the treeline. But it never came back up to the cabin until everyone had finally fallen asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tan had been sitting in the chair watching the door with his rifle. Nobody else heard or saw this, and he told me two days later, after the whole thing was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he had been nodding off after the screaming and noises finally stopped. He&amp;rsquo;d been almost asleep when he saw someone come out of the bathroom and then lay down in the middle of the floor and go to sleep. He just assumed it was one of us and that the guy had nodded off. Then he said he kind of realized something was wrong, and while pretending to be sleeping, he counted us. There were 9 people in the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to try to shoot at the fucking thing and have it kill us all then and there, or have Reese wake up and start shooting and us kill ourselves. So he just stayed awake all night, pretending to be asleep. He said sometimes, it would stand up and kind of do this weird jittery thing, or heave like it was laughing. But then it would lay back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story closes pretty weak, because from my perspective, nothing happened. When we woke up, I noticed that Tan was a little jittery, and that he was avoiding looking at all of us. But we ate some breakfast, packed up, and started walking to his house. He stayed last in the cabin and said he&amp;rsquo;d lock up and bring me my uncle&amp;rsquo;s keys. He told us to just start walking, and that he&amp;rsquo;d catch up. Which I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to fucking do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a little bit up the path, and when he came running up, we just jogged back to his house. His cousin took us home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a window in the bathroom. Tan had gone back to lock up and looked in there. We were too stupid to lock a screenless window, and it was fucking up when he went in there. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it had been doing that all along, waiting for us to fall asleep or slip up and then getting in among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It walked with us all the goddamn way back to his house, and then he said it lagged to the back of the group and looked him dead in the eyes before walking into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m awake now, semi-sober, and ready to finish this for you guys, the internet, and whoever cares to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t find out that Mr. Mays had passed away until a couple months after the funeral service. Initially, I was going to seek out his family in order to send my condolences, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as if Mr. Mays and I were best friends or anything like that; so, I refrained. I continued through my college career and graduated a year or so after our bar meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduating with English as my major wasn&amp;rsquo;t a mistake, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly something that landed me any sort of immediate jobs after college. Now, I had saved a pretty solid amount of money while I was in school and decided that I deserved a bit of a vacation, if you will. I took my spare cash, got together with my college buddy Steve, packed up and hit the road, aiming for somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. I had lived near Littleton, Colorado when I was younger and remembered loving the area, so this destination was as good as any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip was a success. We made it somewhere around Estes Park, Colorado and found a cheap cabin that we rented for about a month. The days were filled with lounging, hiking, and generally things that involved little-to-no work on our parts. After our rental was through, we packed up again and headed on our way back east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime during this trip, we had met up with a couple Estes Park natives in one of the local bars. We never typically &amp;ldquo;hung out&amp;rdquo; with them or anything like that; we just had conversations now and then over drinks and food. One night, these guys were paying their tab and packing up to leave awfully early; they were usually there until the wee hours of the morning. When we questioned them about it, they told us that they were headed to a little get-together with some friends of theirs, and they invited us. Having nothing else to do, we hopped in the car and followed them to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party itself was very low-key, and ultimately inconsequential to this story; however, the important thing about it was that at some point in the night, we were all sitting around the fire and swapping ghost stories. At this point in my life, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as much of a ham as I was in my younger years. But, with a little bit of encouragement, I started on a couple of stories that I remembered telling in my youth. Eventually, I made it to Mr. Mays&amp;rsquo; story about &amp;ldquo;The Showers&amp;rdquo;. Every time that I had told it after hearing it from Mr. Mays, I had spiced it up a little bit. But, out of some sort of subconscious respect for my former teacher, I went straight into the version that he told my class in my sophomore year of high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group enjoyed my stories for the most part, &amp;ldquo;The Showers&amp;rdquo; being the mutual favorite among the partygoers. Steve and I left for the cabin at around five in the morning, and he asked me about that story on the drive home. I told him all about Mr. Mays, that class, my love for everything horror-related and whatnot, and he suggested that we tried to find the place on our return trip to New York. Initially I was reluctant simply because I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like aimlessly wandering through Nebraska for days, looking for some old farm building that was probably demolished at this point. But, a couple of days before we left Colorado, I told Steve that it sounded like fun. We weren&amp;rsquo;t going to be able to do another trip like this for a long time, so I figured that we might as well make the best of it. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I thought of it as a little tribute to Mr. Mays, a guy that, in retrospect, helped me realize that I wanted to be a writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we left Colorado and made the long, boring, and barren drive to Broken Bow, Nebraska, or &amp;ldquo;Hell on Earth&amp;rdquo; as Mr. Mays had put it. We found a motel in town and hung around for a couple of days, venturing out a hundred miles or so in any given direction each day after that. I had remembered Mr. Mays telling us that it was somewhere outside of Broken Bow, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think he got any more specific than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried asking the townsfolk if they had any information about The Showers, but we were usually met with blank stares or eye-rolling when we told them what exactly this place was. The only person who seemed to know anything about it was an older lady that worked at a gas station on the outskirts of town. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall her name, but this woman was just one of those cheerful old people, very helpful and generally interested in what anyone had to say to her. Steve had started talking to her at checkout and she asked about our license plate, commenting about the fact that we were very far from home. We had nowhere in particular to be, so Steve and I ended up talking to this woman for about fifteen minutes, at which point we brought up our hunt for the place known as &amp;ldquo;The Showers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the name didn&amp;rsquo;t ring any bells with the woman which made sense, seeing as Mr. Mays had just given it the name after his experience there. But, when I began to describe the details that I remembered from his story, the friendly old woman interrupted me. Her tone was not scornful or mean in any way, but she became very terse and deliberate with her words from that point on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People don&amp;rsquo;t deal with anything relating to that sort of business around here anymore,&amp;rdquo; she told us. &amp;ldquo;That was all a long time ago.&amp;rdquo; Following her statements, she attempted to be cheerful again, excusing herself to the restroom and wishing us the best on our return trip to New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve and I returned to the car without a word. Both of us were thinking about what the lady had said. Again, she didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be angry at all, she just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hear another word about it. We were driving back to the hotel before Steve said something. &amp;ldquo;I mean, if I had to live in a place associated with an urban legend or something like that, I would totally mess with anyone who asked about it,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I mean, eventually you&amp;rsquo;d just get tired of people asking about it and so you&amp;rsquo;d just try to scare them to get them to shut up, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agreed with Steve and kept driving, but the whole experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t sitting right with me. If this was some sort of well-known legend in the area, why did no one else in the town seem to know anything about it? But, I managed to shrug it off. Mind you, neither of us was scared of finding The Showers; this little excursion on our road trip was more like a scavenger hunt, a cap-off to an overall relaxing vacation. Steve and I were basically like tourists, hunting for the site at which a famous movie was filmed or something like that. We went into the whole situation with little to no expectations and a fleeting hope that we would be able to find this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent another day in Broken Bow before we took our next trip out to try to find The Showers. Nebraska isn&amp;rsquo;t as terrible of a place as people make it out to be, but it really isn&amp;rsquo;t all that exciting. We found a bar and spent some time there, and that was just about the extent of our activity on our &amp;ldquo;day off&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we did get back on the road, we decided that we would attempt to stay off of main roads for as much of the day as we could. I knew that there was no way that this place was going to be off of the highway and I remembered some detail about a dirt road in Mr. Mays&amp;rsquo; story, so we went looking for those. This was a fairly futile effort; most of Nebraska is dirt roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was seven in the evening when we came upon a small, but thick forest. I use the term lightly, but for Nebraska, this place was like an oasis. The trees were full and thick, shrouding most of its insides in darkness. The sun was setting and even though we had run into a few of these random crops of trees, we agreed that this one showed more promise than any of the others. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a road, but there looked to be a path where a dirt road might have been at some point, so we drove along that. If the car was able to handle the Rocky Mountains, a dirt path in Nebraska would give us no trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We moved slowly and carefully along this trail, making sure to clear any fallen trees in the road or rocks that would render the car useless, when the sun finished setting. It was pretty dark in this place during the day, but when night came, it was something else entirely. I had an inkling at this point that we had found the right place, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to jinx it, so we continued onward. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it at the time, but the little bits of light that managed to penetrate the canopy in this miniature forest actually did make it look as if the tree branches were trying to grab the car, just like Mr. Mays had mentioned in the story. I&amp;rsquo;m still convinced that he made up the part about the animal eyes, though; the most aggressive creature we saw in the woods was a dead rabbit on the side of the trail. It didn&amp;rsquo;t have any obvious signs of death; it just looked like it had simply lay down and never bothered to get up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove around in the darkness for quite a while before we found a clearing. We had to move several smaller clusters of branches out of the way before, but right in front of our exit was a giant, dead, monster of a tree. There was no way we were moving this one, so we got out and turned on the bright headlights in the hopes that it would illuminate the area in front of us. There was a feeling of excitement mixed strangely with fear when I saw what lay fifty feet beyond the clearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, lit partially by the headlights from the car and the little bit of light from the crescent moon, was what appeared to be an old barn house. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a typical farmhouse, it was larger than the barns that I had seen in films and didn&amp;rsquo;t have any sort of crest. It basically looked like a small warehouse. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely sure at this point if this was the place we were looking for, but this was definitely the closest we had come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved through the brush until I was roughly twenty feet from the entrance, at which point all of the growth seem to stop. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if the owners had done something to the soil, but the whole structure had a border around it that was clear of any sort of plant life. I approached the entrance to the building, a large sliding door, as Steve came up behind me with two flashlights in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So you were just going to run off into that place in the dark?&amp;rdquo; he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a half-hearted chuckle and grabbed one of the lights from his hand. Mine was a little, but pretty bright flashlight; it was the kind that hikers would most likely fasten to their backpacks, just in case they were stranded at night. It worked well enough. I grabbed the metal door with both hands, holding the flashlight with my mouth, and gave it a tug. It moved slightly, creaked a little bit, but there was no way I was doing this by myself. Steve came up from behind, set his flashlight on the ground, grabbed the door, and said, &amp;ldquo;One, two&amp;hellip;three!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled at the door with all that we could muster. Once we had managed to move it a couple of inches, it must have latched back onto its track because it slid very easily, stopping hard with a loud and echoing thud when it was completely open. Steve picked up his flashlight and walked behind me; I had already moved inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside of the structure was exceptionally bare, almost troublingly so. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely sure how far we were from the nearest home or small town, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t even the slightest bit of evidence that anyone had been in this building for years. There were no broken beer bottles or empty bags of chips; there weren&amp;rsquo;t even any animal droppings or eager plants that managed to grow here. The room was expansive, larger than your average farm, but not the warehouse-sized monstrosity that I believed Mr. Mays had described in his story. I was sure that it was simply a holding area for farming equipment or something similar at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointed, I wandered near the entrance while Steve ventured into the expanse of darkness. As I was running over the details of the story in my mind, something struck me like a sack of bricks; in Mr. Mays&amp;rsquo; story, there was a silo near the barn. I ran outside, my eyes adjusting easily because at the very least it was brighter outside. I looked in all directions, running around the perimeter of the building. Surely, if there was ever a silo near this place, there would be some evidence of it somewhere. But, despite my hopes, there was nothing but a cluster of thick bushes on one side, brush and dirt everywhere, and the forest that we had come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked back into the building, frustrated and tired. Steve was still excited, eagerly running around the inside of the building. &amp;ldquo;Even if I could just find a showerhead or a pipe,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Then we&amp;rsquo;d know it was true. Just keep looking with me.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to ruin his excitement; I had told Steve the story several times, but obviously he didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that this just wasn&amp;rsquo;t the place. The building was weird, yes. It was out of place and oddly pristine, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the location of The Showers. I let him explore for a little bit before I called him over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This was probably as close as we are going to get, man,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;But this isn&amp;rsquo;t it. Remember the silo?&amp;rdquo; His face went from excitement to disappointment in an instant, much like a young child who didn&amp;rsquo;t get the presents he wanted on his birthday. I patted him on the shoulder. &amp;ldquo;This is still pretty cool, though. I mean, we could still tell people that we found it.&amp;rdquo; I was reverting back to my old habits quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve laughed. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, man, I guess we could. It is definitely creepy enough. We should get some pictures as &amp;lsquo;proof&amp;rsquo;, you know?&amp;rdquo; I agreed with him. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go grab the camera really quick,&amp;rdquo; he said as he bolted out the entrance of the building. I was left alone in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very quiet when I was alone in there. I could hear the faint sound of Steve running through the brush and to the car, but once he was far enough away, everything was quiet. I remember not even hearing wind or the chirping of crickets as I walked deeper into the dark, flashlight in hand. I was convinced that there had to be something. As I approached the far corner of the room, the sound of my feet scratching against the dirt was interrupted by a soft, hollow thud. I stopped, trying to figure out what it was. I put my foot down hard against the ground and heard it again. I stomped one more time, realizing that the floor that I was standing on was covering something hollow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked to the wall of the room, looking carefully at the floor to try to spot any holes or gaps. As far as I had known, it was solid ground that this thing sat atop, so I was convinced that I had found a hatch or a basement or something. I heard Steve coming back through the brush as I shouted, &amp;ldquo;Steve! Come over here, it&amp;rsquo;s hol-&amp;rdquo; As I went to say the word &amp;ldquo;hollow,&amp;rdquo; I hopped a little bit, hoping to recreate the sound so that he would be able to hear it upon entering the door. The second that my feet made contact with the floor, I felt it give out beneath me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory of the fall is fuzzy, but I do recall hearing wood splinter. I remember seeing the light from Steve&amp;rsquo;s flashlight falling away into complete darkness. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a long fall, but I must have fallen in a terrible position because I know that I lost consciousness for several seconds at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up I was staring at a bright light. For an instant I had thoughts about approaching the fabled &amp;ldquo;light at the end of the tunnel.&amp;rdquo; I was angry at myself. &amp;ldquo;You died in Nebraska, Jack? Wow, you do know how to fuck up.&amp;rdquo; My self-deprecation in the afterlife was interrupted by what sounded like Steve&amp;rsquo;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus, Jack! Jack, can you hear me? Dude, wake up. Please, wake up,&amp;rdquo; he screamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to lift my head up off of the floor just enough for him to celebrate. The pain in my head was immense, but it was outweighed by the pain shooting through my knee. I knew I had a concussion, but the pain in my knee was just so much more pressing. I looked around until I found my tiny flashlight, then sat up and reassured Steve. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m okay, I just hurt my knee; I bumped my head too, really hard.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank fuck, man. I thought you were dead. Imagine that, though, dying in fucking Nebraska. It&amp;rsquo;d be awful.&amp;rdquo; His words made me laugh a little bit, but I stopped myself; the slightest shaking hurt my head and made me incredibly dizzy. &amp;ldquo;I guess, a rope?&amp;rdquo; said Steve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; I asked, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Should I go get a rope to get you out of here, or do you see a ladder?&amp;rdquo; I looked around the walls that sat in front of me; they were smooth cement. There was no way that I was climbing out of here. &amp;ldquo;Yeah, get the rope,&amp;rdquo; I told him. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s buried under all of our stuff. I think it might be in my red climbing bag, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&amp;rdquo; Steve nodded, telling me to hang in there and that he would be back in a little bit, and then he ran off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silence that followed was uncomfortable. After the sound of Steve&amp;rsquo;s feet scraping the floor above me faded away, I was only able to hear that buzzing that occurs in total silence intertwined with the pulsing in my head. I pushed myself over to the nearest cement wall and braced myself against it, resting and breathing deep in an attempt to calm myself. The cement was unnaturally cold against my back. It was summer, so I only had a t-shirt on, but it felt like ice even through that. Again, this observation was primarily made after the fact. In the moment, it just felt good to lean against something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there, waiting for Steve in this underground basement, and I began to feel uneasy. I felt like an idiot for falling down here; I felt pain from my injuries as well. That all seemed to fade into one emotion in an instant when I heard what I could only identify as breathing, somewhere to my left. I convinced myself that it was my injured mind playing tricks on me for a few moments until my mind decided to rapidly replay Mr. Mays&amp;rsquo; story. When I had first heard it in that classroom years before, I was more impressed than I was scared. But now, sitting in a dark basement in the middle of Nebraska, I felt something that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t felt in a long time; it couldn&amp;rsquo;t even be summed up in the word &amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo;. As I sat there, I felt all-encompassing dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pointed my flashlight to my left, the direction from which I thought I heard the sound. The light didn&amp;rsquo;t reach the other wall; it was too far away. But, I was comforted to see absolutely nothing there. I breathed deeply for a couple more seconds before I heard another noise in the darkness. It was very quick, and I cannot be sure that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my own body moving around without my noticing; but I thought that I heard a scraping sound not ten feet in front of me. It sounded like the noise your feet make when you are walking across a dirt-covered floor. Before I could react, I heard the breathing to my left again, closer this time. There was no way this was real. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen so much as a spider web in this building and now I was convincing myself that something next to me was breathing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was angry at myself for getting so worked up. I told myself that the human brain is constantly hallucinating. I told myself that while in silence or darkness, the brain will make sounds to fill the gap, or make you think you see things that aren&amp;rsquo;t there. I channeled my inner-skeptic in order to calm myself; it worked. It worked until I saw a flash of something in front of me. I can&amp;rsquo;t be entirely sure what it was, but I heard the accompanying sounds of feet scraping against the floor and I began to swell with dread. I decided that the best course of action at this point was to turn off my flashlight, assuming that if they couldn&amp;rsquo;t see me, they couldn&amp;rsquo;t get to me, whatever &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned off my flashlight and was left in complete and total darkness. The bulb of the flashlight faded as it cooled and I put it into my pocket, simultaneously pushing back against the cold cement wall in an attempt to stand. I managed to get up on my feet, well, foot, and found that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand to put any pressure on my injured knee. I limped to the corner, humming to myself, trying to break the deafening silence. I called for Steve, as loud as I could manage, but heard no response. He was probably in the back of the car, still hunting for the rope. There had to be a ladder or something, somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to hum and my heartbeat, which had been beating almost out of my chest, slowed to a manageable rate. I moved along the cement wall, keeping my whole body against it and the weight off of my injured knee. I had traveled what I guessed to be about ten feet when my head made contact with something in front of me. I tumbled to the ground. My concussion must have amplified the pain, because it was blinding. I reached both hands to my forehead when I felt something warm and wet with my fingers. I searched for a cut anywhere on my forehead, but couldn’t find one. I desperately searched for my flashlight as I sat up and tried to get back against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the light in my right hand, bracing against the wall with the other. I turned it on and pointed it into the darkness where I was just lying. The floor was wet, but the dirt had muddled the color of whatever the liquid was. I tried to get my eyes to focus on the puddle, tried to convince myself that it was my blood when I saw another drop fall into the puddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words lack the ability to describe the way I felt when I heard the &amp;ldquo;drip&amp;rdquo; noise again, and saw yet another tiny ball of liquid fall into the puddle. I think I knew, even then, exactly what the source was, but I was endlessly trying to convince myself that I was wrong. I lifted the flashlight up and pointed it at the source of the liquid. What stared back at me was a pipe that protruded at least a foot out from the cement wall. The metal was rusted and cracked; little bits of the liquid began to seep from them. At the end of the pipe was a simple showerhead, aimed down towards the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that feeling when your stomach drops? In this case, I think mine literally did, because I vomited immediately. It got all over my shoe, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the least bit important at the time. I ignored the pain in my knee and shuffled along the wall as fast as I possibly could. I heard noises, but I can&amp;rsquo;t be sure if it was just the sounds of my own movement or something around me. I managed to duck under the next showerhead. This one was higher up on the wall, and seemed to be leaking the same liquid that the other one was. I felt like I was moving along something infinite. Every now and then I would have to duck or move under another metal bar, another showerhead. They began to pour more profusely, but the liquid was too thick to come out easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room began to smell. I remembered immediately the way that Mr. Mays had described it. I grabbed my shirt and put it over my nose, trucking onward, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop the smell for an instant. It smelled like vomit; it smelled like shit; it smelled like burnt hair; it smelled like rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still moving against the wall when I fell into some sort of outlet. I hit the dirt ground hard, adrenaline coursing through my veins; the pain still managed to break through, though. My flashlight was still in my hand; I aimed it and examined my surroundings. Sitting in front of me was a doorway. There was a door there, though it looked aged now. It had a nice little design on it, a doorknob, and a knocker that looked like a snarling demon. Red paint was peeling from it, flaking off and falling to the ground in front of me. I clumsily rose and busted through the door, narrowly missing a piece of hanging sheet metal in front of me. I was crawling now; there was no way that I could run. The walls and ceiling were lined with metal, the kind that you would see on the roof of a farm. Large pieces of wood seemed to brace the sheets, holding this makeshift tunnel together. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t risk sliding against that and possibly cutting myself on the metal, or hitting the wood and causing a cave-in. So I crawled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled myself for what felt like miles, running into walls every now and then because the path seemed to curve like a snake. I had no idea where I was in relation to the hole that I had fallen through, but I told myself that there was an exit at the end of this. Had I not been crawling, I would have surely hurt myself far worse. There were parts of the tunnel in which the ceiling dipped down to maybe three feet above the ground. It hadn&amp;rsquo;t caved in, because the ceiling still lined it. Someone had built it like this. This, again, is in hindsight. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care at the time. I kept telling myself there was nothing behind me, but I swore that I heard feet scraping only a few inches behind my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My jeans would brush against my legs every now and then, making it feel like someone was touching me, and even now, I still can&amp;rsquo;t completely convince myself that someone wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I crawled and crawled until I reached an upslope. With joy I looked ahead of me; there was a cellar door. The door was made of wood; I knew this because I could see light through them. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sure, but I thought it might have been the light from the car&amp;rsquo;s headlights. Besides all of that, I was just so immensely happy to find an exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crawled all the way to the door and threw my shoulder into it. It budged, but didn&amp;rsquo;t open. I began to scream, but I my throat seared with pain. The most I could manage was a harsh crying noise; it sounded like a dying animal. I collapsed in exhaustion and pain, my eyes staring up at the slits of light before me. I was so close to being out of here; I could taste it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in that moment of silent defeat that I heard a noise that was, without question, something moving in the tunnel. It sounded like something was being dragged across the floor. It would move, pause for a second, and then move again. I had nothing left in my stomach to throw up, but I began to gag. I gathered myself slightly and tried to steady my hand enough to focus the flashlight into the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I saw, I can still not rationalize. I know what I saw, but I cannot convince myself that it was actually there. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop telling myself that I was hallucinating. I saw a child in a dirty sleeping gown. The gown was stained with something dark and brown, with occasional splashes of a deep red. The child was extremely frail, like the pictures that people might see of a holocaust victim. I could only make out one eye, brightly reflecting the light of my flashlight. In between huge tufts of long, dirty hair. It reached down beyond the fingertips of the child, which were caked with dirt. The boy, or girl, I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure which, moved towards me with difficulty. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t breathing hard, but it seemed that every movement of every muscle took every ounce of strength the child had. The thing that froze me, though, was the eye. It was only visible because it was reflecting my flashlight, but even in that glint, I could feel anger, or deep hatred, or something like it. This is the point in which the English language really lacks the right words to explain the situation. I could tell that this child meant me harm. Whether it was a hallucination or not, the thing was getting closer. I started to cry. It was getting closer and closer when I heard a voice from behind me. &amp;ldquo;Hey, Jack,&amp;rdquo; whispered the voice. It was Steve, I was certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to talk back, fully intending to say, &amp;ldquo;Open this up and get me out right now.&amp;rdquo; However, given my current state, I am sure it just sounded like garbled nonsense. I clawed at the door, pushing against it with everything that I had and finally breaking eye contact with the child. As I did this, the flashlight rolled down the slope, coming to rest somewhere near the child&amp;rsquo;s feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you see?&amp;rdquo; the voice asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you talking about?&amp;rdquo; I closed my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember hearing a reply along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Just look at it. Tell me what you see,&amp;rdquo; but my own screams of frustration drowned it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was mumbling like a maniac when the voice told me, calmly, &amp;ldquo;Rest for a second, I&amp;rsquo;ll get it.&amp;rdquo; The statement took a second to settle in, at which point I closed my eyes tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Steve, just do it please. Please, just get it open please,&amp;rdquo; I whimpered. &amp;ldquo;Just get me out of here.&amp;rdquo; My voice was beginning to get louder. &amp;ldquo;Steve, god dammit, open the fucking wooden door.&amp;rdquo; I opened my eyes for a split second to see nothing but black hair, dangling in front of my face, a small glint of light hidden in the mess of tangles. I slammed my eyes shut and screamed with every ounce of energy I had, &amp;ldquo;Open the fucking do&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; The door behind me gave way, and I fell onto the dirt, taking in a breath of fresh air. My eyes were still closed, but the first thing that I did was scramble to find the cellar door and close it. Once I had done that, I took a deep breath and opened my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the barn in front of me, illuminated by the headlights of the car. My head was pulsing with pain. I was covered in dirt and liquids that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even care to know the origin of. My knee was, at the very least, dislocated. But despite all of that, I was out of the tunnel. I took a deep breath, buried my head in my hands, and said &amp;ldquo;Steve, why didn&amp;rsquo;t you just fucking open the door?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited for a response, but none came. &amp;ldquo;Steve, seriously,&amp;rdquo; I began, &amp;ldquo;I was fucking clawing, screaming for my life,&amp;rdquo; I said as I looked behind me. My stomach must have been on the verge of falling out of me at this point, because it shifted again. The only thing behind me was the large mass of bushes that I had seen while examining the perimeter or the building. I was angry. &amp;ldquo;Steve, this is not the fucking time. Come out of the fucking bushes.&amp;rdquo; I was getting ready to stand up when I heard a yell from the front of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flashlight bobbed up and down in the semi-darkness. Steve was running into the open door of the structure, yelling my name and telling me not to worry. I must have lost consciousness at that point. When I woke up, Steve was standing over me, desperately trying to wake me up. His words were almost incoherent, at least to my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He helped me to my feet and began to walk me to the car. As we walked away, I saw my flashlight sitting just outside the cellar door, the light was fading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve brought me back to the car and then drove me to the nearest hospital. I fell asleep, but he told me that he drove around for an hour before he found a main road. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever told him the whole story. I believe he thinks that I was just injured from the fall. He never really asked about it, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t stay in contact for much longer. It&amp;rsquo;s not like we deliberately parted ways, we just sort of stopped hanging out after that trip and went our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been able to fully understand what happened that night. There are many things that I can explain away as being hallucinations, but there are still many things that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense. The showerheads were there and they were leaking something. The door was real, the tunnel was real. Most everything else can be semi-rationalized if I can convince myself that I had a very bad concussion, a very, very bad concussion. But the one thing that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have imagined was that cellar door was locked, and then it suddenly wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still as skeptical as I have ever been, but I believe in what happened to me at The Showers. I&amp;rsquo;m not a hermit or a social retard because of this. I drink a lot, but I am still functional. But, I will never return to Nebraska; no one will ever be able to convince me otherwise. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch horror movies either; there is absolutely nothing entertaining about being so desperately scared. That&amp;rsquo;s it, really. There is no typical ending for my story. I was changed by my experience, yeah. But, there is no way to change anything about it or &amp;ldquo;fight back&amp;rdquo; against it. I can&amp;rsquo;t even convince myself that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t just seeing things. Believe me; I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, there was really no way to find any information on The Showers. The legend didn&amp;rsquo;t extend outside the classroom of Mr. Mays. No one told stories like this to keep children away from a certain place or to scare them; it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t known. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s really the point of this whole story. I want people to know, first hand, what this place is like. Maybe it is a drunk&amp;rsquo;s rationale, or the kid inside me wanting to spread these kinds of stories again. I don&amp;rsquo;t know; I don&amp;rsquo;t care. But, it&amp;rsquo;s out there now, for people to mold and warp to their needs. Most importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s finally out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s getting late and I&amp;rsquo;m getting another drink. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work at a gas station in rural Pennsylvania. It&amp;rsquo;s a boring job, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy and it pays all right. A few weeks ago, this new guy started; I&amp;rsquo;ll call him Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy is weird. He&amp;rsquo;s about 25 or 26, and he hardly speaks, but he&amp;rsquo;s got the creepiest laugh I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard. My boss and I have both noticed this, but it&amp;rsquo;s never been a problem, so there&amp;rsquo;s not much we can do about it. Customers have never complained about him, and he&amp;rsquo;s always done his job fairly well. Up until a few weeks ago, anyway&amp;mdash;that&amp;rsquo;s when things started going missing. Employee theft can be a problem at any business that sells consumer goods, and there&amp;rsquo;s only one person working at a time at this gas station (it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty small place). About two weeks ago, my boss started noticing that we were short on motor oil. At first, it was a few containers at a time, then entire shelves and boxes from the back room. Pretty soon entire shipments would be gone the day after we got them, and it would always be right after Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s shifts. My boss has checked the security camera tapes from every single night he worked, but he could never catch him in the act. Jeremy would lock up at closing, then the motor oil would be gone the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss usually takes the tapes home with him to try and catch Jeremy stealing, but his daughter had a softball game last night, so he asked me to watch the tape for him. He offered to pay me overtime, under-the-table, so obviously I took that offer. There are three cameras, so he gave me three different tapes to check. I figured it would be a long night, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to save up for vacation, so I really needed the money. I took the tapes home, popped them in an old VCR and sat back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days ago (the last time he worked), Jeremy started at 4 PM. Everything seemed pretty normal at first. He counted up his drawer, switched off with the girl who was working before him, and waited for a customer. The first person who came in was Mrs. Templeton (the timestamp on the video read 4:03), a regular. She picked up her cigarettes and a newspaper and paid with a twenty. Nothing unusual there. The next customer was some local guy named Ron. He drives a motorcycle, usually comes in every few days. He filled up his tank, got a bag of beef jerky, paid with his credit card, and then left. Next was some guy with a cowboy hat. I&amp;rsquo;d never seen him before, but we get plenty of strangers passing through, just like at any gas station. He got forty dollars worth of diesel fuel, paid with a hundred dollar bill, and went on his way. I sat back and sighed. The only thing more boring than doing this job is watching someone else do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss&amp;rsquo;s offer was enough to keep me watching though, so I left the tape on. Everything seemed pretty normal. I had a feeling that if Jeremy was stealing motor oil, he knew we were suspicious of him by now. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect him to be dumb enough to let us catch him on camera. Things stayed boring and routine until about five o&amp;rsquo;clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 5:03, Mrs. Templeton came back in; she must have forgotten something. But she didn&amp;rsquo;t. She bought the same pack of cigarettes as before, and the same newspaper. She paid with another twenty. That&amp;rsquo;s odd, I thought, but then again, she&amp;rsquo;s a little absent-minded. I thought Jeremy should have told her she already got her smokes, but it&amp;rsquo;s not against the rules to sell somebody the same thing twice. That&amp;rsquo;s when Ron came in again. He bought another tank of gas (for his motorcycle again&amp;mdash;I later checked the outdoor camera because I thought maybe he had another car he wanted to fill up) and the same pack of beef jerky. He paid with his credit card again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No big deal, I figured this was just a weird coincidence. Mrs. Templeton is forgetful and Ron probably owns more than one Harley. That&amp;rsquo;s when the guy in the cowboy hat came back in. I felt a chill run down my spine. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t get diesel, don&amp;rsquo;t get diesel,&amp;rdquo; I found myself whispering to my empty living room&amp;hellip;but he did. He got forty dollars worth of diesel fuel and paid with another hundred dollar bill. Every move he made was identical to his first visit, right down to the way he scratched his nose before he walked out. Either this guy is rich, owns a lot of trucks, and just moved into town, or something really bizarre was happening. I kept watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every customer for the next hour was the same as before. Every single one. I was seriously freaked out, and then at 6:03, Mrs. Templeton walked back in. She bought her cigarettes and newspaper again, and paid with a twenty again. I thought I was going to lose it. I only watched another half hour before I started fast-forwarding through the rest. It was all the same. Every customer would come in at the exact same times, exactly one hour apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking. That sneaky motherfucker Jeremy had messed with the tapes. He had run a loop of his first hour of business over and over. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case. There are windows around the cash register area that the camera covers, and I watched the sunlight fade as time ran on. Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s routine didn&amp;rsquo;t loop over&amp;mdash;he swept, mopped, restocked, and did all his duties exactly how you would expect. But the same customers kept coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was panicking at this point. Something was seriously wrong with what I was seeing, and I had no explanation for it. I skipped ahead to when he locked up and walked out to his car. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t stolen anything, but I kept watching, just to make sure. I fast forwarded one last time, to about midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At exactly 12:03, out of nowhere, Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s face pops up on the camera. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean he moved his head into view, I mean that one second the store was empty, the next second his face was all I could see. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking at the camera, he was looking at me, I was sure of it. I screamed and fumbled for the remote. By the time I grabbed it, he was gone, just as soon as he had left. One frame he was there, the next he wasn&amp;rsquo;t. My hands were shaking like crazy, but I popped in another tape. The other indoor camera shows the back area, by the cash register, and I would be able to see how he got up to put his face in the camera like that. I skipped ahead to 12:03, but there was nothing. I would have been able to see him standing on a chair or something on this tape, but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t there. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see him enter the store at all after he left. It&amp;rsquo;s like he wasn&amp;rsquo;t really there. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the security code, and no alarms were triggered that night after he locked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did see, however, was that at 12:03, the motor oil vanished off the shelf. All of it. Same as Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s face, one second it was there and the next it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I turned that tape off and went to bed, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a wink of sleep. My body is exhausted right now, but my mind is racing. That tape was undoubtedly the creepiest, most disturbing thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in a few hours. My boss asked me to bring the tapes back in and let him know what I found, but really, what the hell am I going to say? Jeremy works the night shift tonight, directly after me, and the plan is for my boss to come in just before I leave and confront him with me (as I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be the one who caught him stealing). I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ll have to show my boss the tapes, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to watch them with him. I never want to see something like that again. I can&amp;rsquo;t get the image of Jeremy just smiling directly into the camera out of my mind; it was the creepiest look I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen on another human being&amp;rsquo;s face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try again to get some last minute sleep before I have to go in and deal with this. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you guys know what happens&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (2:49 PM): Updating from my phone, apologies in advance for errors. My boss just finished watching the last of the tapes. I told him what to expect, but you really can&amp;rsquo;t prepare someone for something like that. He&amp;rsquo;s scared shitless (I still am too) and Jeremy is due to come in at 4. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a little over an hour to get our shit together, but neither one of us knows what to say to him. Is he just a fucked up guy who likes to steal motor oil and scare the shit out of people? Or is he something else? I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is crazy, but does anyone think he could have anything to do with the time loop? My boss said he never noticed anything like that in the other tapes, but the way he popped up in this one made me think he knew I would be watching. It&amp;rsquo;s like he wanted me to see what he could do. Like he was showing off or something. The way he smiled into the camera was like a little kid showing you a sandcastle they just built or something. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I probably sound crazy. I sure feel the part. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk to my boss some more. We have to calm ourselves down and figure out how to handle this. I&amp;rsquo;ll update again tonight, but I have a really bad feeling about how this is going to play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (4:33 PM): No sign of Jeremy. Tried calling him, but his phone has been disconnected. We&amp;rsquo;re calling the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (5:33 PM): No sign of Jeremy. Tried calling him, but his phone has been disconnected. We&amp;rsquo;re calling the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (6:33 PM): No sign of Jeremy. Tried calling him, but his phone has been disconnected. We&amp;rsquo;re calling the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (7:33 PM): No sign of Jeremy. Tried calling him, but his phone has been disconnected. We&amp;rsquo;re calling the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (8:33 PM): No sign of Jeremy. Tried calling him, but his phone has been disconnected. We&amp;rsquo;re calling the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE (10:58 PM): Holy shit. Holy shit holy shit holy shit. I just got home and saw my previous updates. Things make less sense now than ever. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I can tell you. I went to work, Jeremy never showed up, my boss and I decided to call the police, as you&amp;rsquo;re well aware. When I picked up the phone to call, though, the sun went out. I shit you not, that&amp;rsquo;s what I thought happened. Apparently, I blacked out for exactly five hours, because when I looked at the clock, it was 9:33. I think I got stuck in Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s time loop, and then I snapped out of it at the exact point I blacked out, if that makes sense. But that&amp;rsquo;s when things got really weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss was right next to me when I blacked out, ready to corroborate my story to the cops. When I came to, the phone was in my hand, but it was dead. Not even a dial tone. My boss was still right there, but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t moving. He was standing up, but frozen. I looked at the clock again, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t moving. The second hand was stuck on the 12. It was 9:33 exactly. The clock on the register (computer screen) wasn&amp;rsquo;t moving either. My phone was frozen. There was even a customer at the register, waiting for my boss to get him cigarettes. I&amp;rsquo;m betting that would have been his fifth pack of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the fuck out of there. Didn&amp;rsquo;t lock up, didn&amp;rsquo;t turn the lights out, and sorry guys, I didn&amp;rsquo;t grab the security tapes to upload on the internet. Believe me, that was the last thing on my mind. The gas station is on a major highway, and cars were parked all along it, except they weren&amp;rsquo;t parked, they were frozen. The people inside were sitting still as wax statues. I got in my car and prayed that it would start. Thankfully it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About halfway home, time started up again. The static from the radio turned into music like it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be, and from what I could tell by listening to the host talk in between songs, no one noticed the time freeze, or whatever it was. I was the only one. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m sure Jeremy noticed as well. I still have no clue where he is or what he&amp;rsquo;s doing. I&amp;rsquo;m hiding in my room and calling the police again in the morning. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I ever got through to them before, or if I did, whether they took me seriously. I&amp;rsquo;m scared for my life at this point. I&amp;rsquo;ll update tomorrow, if I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINAL UPDATE (10:33 AM): I finally fell asleep last night around 4. I have no idea how I did it, I guess exhaustion finally got the best of me. This morning, I woke up to my phone ringing; it was my boss. He&amp;rsquo;d been calling me since about 6. He woke up when time turned back on last night and immediately called the cops. They came by to see what was wrong and he told them everything. The police around here are all small time guys; they were more concerned with the missing motor oil than anything, but my boss figured he would take it, as long as he had their attention. They decided to go looking for Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep all our employees&amp;rsquo; applications on file, and since Jeremy just started working here, his was easy to find. They checked the address on it and headed over to his house. You&amp;rsquo;re not gonna believe what they found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The address Jeremy listed on his application was an empty lot. Or at least now it is. There used to be a house there, but it burned down in 1993. Being a small town, almost everyone remembers that fire. A family of four used to live there way back when. Rumor has it that they had an estranged son who they never really talked about, but I can&amp;rsquo;t say for sure if that&amp;rsquo;s true. What I can say is true is that after an insurance investigation, the fire was ruled an arson. The entire house was soaked in oil and torched with a Molotov cocktail. The entire family was sleeping when it happened; none of them survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They never caught the guy who did it. Rumor has it that when they tried to contact the estranged son, no one could find him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my boss called and told me this, and I freaked out. Then he asked me to come to the gas station. &amp;ldquo;What are you, crazy?&amp;rdquo; I said, but he assured me that the cops were there with him. Then he dropped a bomb: the FBI was also in town and they were going to talk to me one way or another, so I might as well come in. It was about 7:15, and I wanted to go back to bed, but I figured I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to sleep much more anyway, so I went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four men in suits greeted me and told me to have a seat. We went over everything two or three times until they got all the details down. I told them about Jeremy, the security tape, last night at work. Everything. Finally, after I finished, one of the agents said, &amp;ldquo;Oh Christ, we&amp;rsquo;ve got another one on our hands.&amp;rdquo; Then they made me sign a bunch of papers saying I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone about what happened, so I can&amp;rsquo;t say much more. I might be breaking the law just by posting this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;rsquo;m home. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to do with myself. That agent&amp;rsquo;s words when I told him the story are going to haunt me for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to go. I have some errands to run today, and then I have to go into work to pick up some tapes. My boss and I think this new guy Jeremy (he&amp;rsquo;s a complete creep) is stealing motor oil and I have to watch the security footage to see if I can catch him doing it. I have better things to do, but my boss is paying me overtime, under-the-table, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to save up for vacation so I could really use the money. It should be pretty simple; the oil always goes missing right after his shifts. I figure I&amp;rsquo;ll just watch the tapes, catch him in the act, and that will be that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>The Smiling Man</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About five years ago, I lived downtown in a major city in the US. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep. To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid. I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite. But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a Wednesday, somewhere between one and two in the morning, and I was walking near a police-patrolled park quite a ways from my apartment. It was quiet, even for a weeknight, with very little traffic and almost no-one on foot. The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned down a short side-street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him. At the far end of the street, on my side, was the silhouette of a man, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding he was probably drunk, I stepped as close as I could to the road to give him the majority of the sidewalk to pass me by. The closer he got, the more I realized how gracefully he was moving. He was very tall and lanky, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face. His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky. His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side, I glanced back&amp;hellip; and then stopped dead in my tracks. He had stopped dancing and was standing with one foot in the street, perfectly parallel to me. He was facing me but still looking skyward, smile still wide on his lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/smiling-man/The_smiling_man.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/smiling-man/small-The_smiling_man.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;The_smiling_man.jpg&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again, but kept my eyes on the man. He didn&amp;rsquo;t move. Once I had put about half a block between us, I turned away from him for a moment to watch the sidewalk in front of me. The street ahead of me was completely empty. Still unnerved, I looked back to where he had been standing to find him gone. For the briefest of moments, I felt relieved, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than ten seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so shocked that I stood there for some time, staring at him. And then he started moving toward me again. He took giant, exaggerated, tip-toed steps, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I just stood there, completely frozen, as the smiling man crept toward me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he stopped again, about a car length away from me. Still smiling his smile, still looking to the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally found my voice, I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. What I meant to ask was, &amp;ldquo;What do you want?!&amp;rdquo; in an angry, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper: &amp;ldquo;Whaaat…?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, they can certainly hear it. I heard it in my own voice, and that only made me more afraid. But he didn&amp;rsquo;t react to it at all. He just stood there, smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, after what felt like forever, he turned around, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran until I was off of the side-road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, he was nowhere to be found. The rest of the way home, I kept glancing over my shoulder, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lived in that city for six months after that night, and I never went out for another walk. There was something about his face that always haunted me. He didn&amp;rsquo;t look drunk, he didn&amp;rsquo;t look high. He looked completely and utterly insane. And that&amp;rsquo;s a very, very scary thing to see.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Cure for Cancer</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Marissa said, &amp;ldquo;Maybe we should see other people,&amp;rdquo; Nicholas decided to give her cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas, like many geniuses, had his great obsession. The root of his monomania wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard to trace. After all, he&amp;rsquo;d lost both his parents to cancer by the age of thirteen. He bore mute witness as they wasted away, leaking mucilaginous fluids onto crisp white hospital sheets. Colon cancer (father) and lung cancer (mother) had followed in quick succession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outwardly, he remained stoic; inwardly, he was a roil of emotion. First debilitating grief, then rage at his parents for abandoning him. Followed by searing guilt. Guilt at surviving. Guilt at having done nothing to save his parents. Certainly he&amp;rsquo;d been young when it all happened, not even of legal age; still he suffered lingering doubts that if only he&amp;rsquo;d asked the right questions, insisted on different doctors or courses of treatments, spoke out for his parents when they&amp;rsquo;d been unable, things might have gone differently. For years he prayed that cancer would take him too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven months after he&amp;rsquo;d watched his mother&amp;rsquo;s casket lowered into the ground alongside his father&amp;rsquo;s grave, and one week after he turned thirteen, Nicholas matriculated at Harvard. By the age of sixteen he&amp;rsquo;d graduated &lt;em&gt;summa cum laude&lt;/em&gt; with a degree in biology. At twenty-five, he&amp;rsquo;d already published half a dozen groundbreaking studies, was a full professor at his &lt;em&gt;alma mater&lt;/em&gt; and an M.D. His goal was nothing less than the Holy Grail of cancer research: a magic bullet to cure all cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By twenty-eight, frustrated with the incessant struggle for funding and bothersome distractions of teaching, he&amp;rsquo;d left academe for full-time research in a corporate lab. Twelve years he toiled at Recombicon, insisting on working alone, skirted by colleagues made uncomfortable by his brooding intensity. He didn&amp;rsquo;t care that he must look a freak to them, tall and thin, a long sad face, stooped shoulders, skin sallow from the fluorescent lights of the lab. More than once he&amp;rsquo;d been likened to John Carradine, the perennial B-movie mad scientist. Yet he did nothing to dispel this image, favouring somber garb and the dark stubble of almost-beards, while sectioning cancerous mammals with precise strokes of his scalpel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he was tolerated, venerated even, by the corporation&amp;rsquo;s board: his work had produced several lucrative patents. They gave him the things he needed and left him alone. In the same way cancer had relentlessly consumed his parents&amp;rsquo; vital organs, so it consumed his imagination, day after day in the lab, and during endless, sheet-twisting nights in his spartan, bare-walled apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Marissa happened into his life, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even obsessed geniuses can fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IRS had sent Marissa to audit him, he never having filed a return, nor answered any of their letters. She waited for him outside his apartment, into the wee hours of the morning, until he dragged himself home from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She startled him, looming out of the darkness, spectral, pale as a gibbous moon, the oval of her lovely, preternatural face framed in white hair. But most startling of all were her eyes, deep-red pupils, like those of a photo&amp;rsquo;s flash-frozen cat, surrounded by milky blue irises. Bewitched, Nicholas couldn&amp;rsquo;t look away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marissa was a breathtakingly beautiful albino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wore a perfectly tailored, black suit, a shocking contrast to her unpigmented skin and Argentine hair. A red garnet pin on her lapel glowed with the same eerie light as her eyes. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve been a bad boy,&amp;rdquo; she said, and that was all it took for Nicholas to fall terminally in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audit can be a simple thing if one keeps good records; or, if the records are spotty, it can take a long time, require the auditor and auditee to spend many hours huddled, head to head, weaving together the intimate details of one&amp;rsquo;s financial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas&amp;rsquo; case was the latter. Not only had his parents come from money&amp;mdash;carrying with them all the attendant stocks, bonds, and sundry other investments he&amp;rsquo;d inherited and then ignored&amp;mdash;but the generous royalty contract he&amp;rsquo;d negotiated with his biotech firm had netted him a small fortune now that three of the drugs he&amp;rsquo;d developed were fairly burning up the market. His tax liability, penalties included, was substantial. Seven figures, was her guess. A prolonged audit would be necessary. Nicholas was elated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next few weeks he spent less and less time at the lab, and more and more at his apartment with Marissa, sifting through his financial records, slowly exposing his empty life through an audit trail. Within days cancer had been displaced in all his waking thoughts by her; when she wasn&amp;rsquo;t around, he suffered the pangs of nascent love, the sleepless nights and tortuous days waiting for her to reappear. To prolong the audit, he lost some of the critical paperwork, purposefully misreported on other forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was unfazed. They ordered pizza as they tried to make sense of his statements of earning and losses; tipped espressos in the local donut shop as they sorted receipts. When it turned out he was nominal president of three numbered corporations, and that his net worth was in the tens of millions, he shrugged. Marissa was clearly puzzled by his reaction, at his indifference to his own wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, she seemed to warm to him, took to calling him by his first name, to touching his arm lightly when she discovered something of interest in the sea of documents. One day, they even took boxes of pay stubs to dinner at her favourite restaurant, an intimate Turkish café. It was here, after the meal, that she jokingly suggested he might add to his paltry deductions by marrying her and having a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage. A child. With Marissa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His heart soared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks passed before the first kiss, weeks in which Nicholas fretted endlessly about her feelings, replayed their encounters over and over again in his mind trying to gauge her reactions to his clumsy advances. Marissa. Beautiful, delicate Marissa. When the last &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo; was dotted and last &amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; crossed on his final return, they kissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, cancer seemed unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maybe we should see other people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marissa&amp;rsquo;s words jolted Nicholas out of his body. He floated above them, the vacated shell of his physical self still in bed next to her, frozen in rejection, his glistening erection, not yet subsided, withering instantly. Twice before he&amp;rsquo;d experienced this out-of-body phenomenon: both times when the same stooped oncologist had explained his parents&amp;rsquo; cancers had metastasized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Things aren&amp;rsquo;t working out the way I&amp;rsquo;d hoped,&amp;rdquo; Marissa said to the shadows of his bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas collapsed back into his body. Every molecule of his being wanted to scream, &lt;em&gt;No! You&amp;rsquo;re wrong!&lt;/em&gt;, but he remained tight-lipped. As self-contained as he had been at the side of his parents&amp;rsquo; hospital beds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re ready for this level of commitment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could she say that? Of course he was ready. Tonight he had planned on telling her he loved her. That he wanted to be with her forever. Too late for that now. Unless . . . Reaching out, he put his hand on her breast, traced its shape the way she liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; But her sharp intake of breath belied her admonition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas feathered the back of his hand down her belly, felt tiny invisible hairs rise to meet his knuckles. As soft as a breeze, his hand slid between her legs, his long index finger straightening into the mucilaginous warmth. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo; Marissa disentangled herself and rose, looming naked in the moonlight, her skin flawless as the finest English porcelain. Heart-stoppingly beautiful. A contrast, in Nicholas&amp;rsquo; imagination, to his own scrawny, consumptive form. Of course she wanted to see other men. Younger, better looking men. Men she could love the way he loved her. He pulled the sheets up to his chin, ashamed of his pitiful carcass. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re dumping me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t say it like that, Nicholas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His genius utterly failed him. She was slipping away while all he could do was stupidly clutch the edge of the sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know I want children.&amp;rdquo; She looked away. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re ready.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s what this was about. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look, Nicholas, you&amp;rsquo;re a nice guy. But there&amp;rsquo;s an anger inside you that scares me. It&amp;rsquo;s poisoning our relationship. I can barely cope, so how could a child deal with it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger? Nicholas was taken aback. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t bring your parents back,&amp;rdquo; she said sharply, as if she were annoyed at him for forcing her to explain. &amp;ldquo;Not by being with me. Or by having your own child.&amp;rdquo; Marissa pulled on her panties, an absence of black against her alabaster skin, slid her arms through the straps of her bra, its dark lines bisecting her breasts. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to get going.&amp;rdquo; Her tone softened, became conciliatory. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about it later. When we&amp;rsquo;re calmer. Next week. Okay?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had nothing to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too fast, too fast, she&amp;rsquo;d gathered up her things and was gone, leaving Nicholas in the dark, a ghostly after-image of her naked luminescence burnt indelibly into his corneas. He felt abandoned, lost, as much as he had that day he stood alone over the twin graves of his parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was when he knew he had to give her cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of his plan was simple: he&amp;rsquo;d save her and she&amp;rsquo;d love him. How to do it? Three years ago he&amp;rsquo;d worked on a clandestine project funded by the CIA. The agency had requested an undetectable delivery system for aggressive cancers using emasculated viral vectors&amp;mdash;a kind of deleterious gene therapy. Nicholas pulled up the old files. The cancer he selected, an accelerated pancreatic cancer, was one he&amp;rsquo;d fathered in his lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He knew its cell surface proteins as intimately as he would have known the face of his own child. And so knew its weaknesses too. In his experiments, he found that he could vanquish the malignant neoplasm easily, working miraculous recoveries in chimpanzees languishing in the latter stages of the disease. He also knew conventional therapies would be useless in fighting his variant. It was ideal. The only problem was its liquid suspension system: too dark, too viscid, and with a sharp, funky aftertaste that made it useless to the CIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Marissa loved the thick, brackish coffee served at the Turkish place. Nicholas was right in believing that the murky liquid was one of the few substances likely to mask the taste, smell and appearance of his acrid, carcinogenic goo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tiny squeeze tube in his pocket. An opportune moment when she excused herself to go to the toilet. Nicholas picked up a silver-plated teaspoon, stirred, watching the liquid diffuse in the miniature cup. Marissa returned and resumed her seat. She looked at him oddly. Nicholas frowned, then realized he was still stirring her coffee. &amp;ldquo;Sorry,&amp;rdquo; he said, dropping the spoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked at her cup, then at him. &amp;ldquo;Are you all right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweat trickled down his temple. &amp;ldquo;Fine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His stomach knotted. Until now he&amp;rsquo;d been so focused on preparing his cancer he hadn&amp;rsquo;t had time to experience doubts. Now he looked at her, at beautiful Marissa. What the hell was he doing? Reaching for her cup, he curled his fingers around it. &amp;ldquo;That one&amp;rsquo;s probably cold. I&amp;rsquo;ll order you another.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She grabbed his wrist. Nicholas felt his own quickened pulse beating beneath her pale fingers. &amp;ldquo;No. It&amp;rsquo;s fine. I . . . I have to be going.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Going? But we haven&amp;rsquo;t really talked.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to say.&amp;rdquo; She looked away, out the window. &amp;ldquo;Besides,&amp;rdquo; she said, far too casually, while letting go of his wrist. &amp;ldquo;I really do have to be going. Another case.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another case? Another late night audit? Like his? Nicholas felt nauseous. He let go of the cup. Marissa picked it up and put it to her lips. Nicholas watched her drink. She dropped her share of the bill on the table and, with a chaste peck on Nicholas&amp;rsquo; cheek, was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six weeks later she called him from the cancer ward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask any researcher: as good as a chimp is for modelling a human being, a chimp is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a human being. So, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been a complete surprise to Nicholas when things went awry. Amidst the monitor ping and the drip of the IV, he hovered over her hospital bed, devastated. Marissa&amp;rsquo;s fingers clutched weakly at his. She looked deceptively normal. But inside things had gone very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the lab experiments, Marissa&amp;rsquo;s cancer had metastasized. Slipped into other organs where it wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to have gone. It spread with a single-minded virulence that befuddled the doctors at the hospital. In a matter of weeks Marissa&amp;rsquo;s poor body had not only been assaulted by pancreatic cancer, but had been besieged with an inexplicable spate of other cancers afflicting her colon, lungs and throat. Nicholas&amp;rsquo; miraculous cure aimed at only one target: the pancreas. In that respect, the experimental drug he proffered the doctors had worked exceptionally well. They were singularly impressed at the results. But as for the other cancers . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They gave her four months, tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas stared at Marissa&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, sad face. She would abandon him as his parents had. And, for all his genius, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a damn thing he could do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or was there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fused trophoblasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;d made the proposal to the board several years ago. His notion was to fight cancer with an equally aggressive vector: embryonic cells. Or, more specifically, trophoblasts cultivated from embryonic cells. After all, the embryo&amp;rsquo;s struggle to bury itself in its mother&amp;rsquo;s uterus was rivaled only by the assault of malignant cancer on normal tissue. His Powerpoint animation showed the engineered cells, his black magic bullets, dispersing throughout the body like a swarm of angry bees, targeting malignant growths, then hijacking critical blood for their own voracious appetite, starving out the malignancy. Once its host died, the engineered trophoblast cells would starve too. On Nicholas&amp;rsquo; screen bright tangles of tumorous cells crumbled under the onslaught, disappearing altogether. Complete remission in days. A catholicon for all cancers in a single syringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convincing presentation, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the board hadn&amp;rsquo;t found it so. Rather, they found it unpalatable. Developing bio-weapons for the CIA was one thing; creating human embryos from which to harvest cells was another. Support for the project was roundly rejected, thus making it impossible for Nicholas to obtain the embryonic material he needed for his experiments. He moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only now his magic bullet was Marissa&amp;rsquo;s last hope. She simply had too many tumors, too many targets, even if he stole all the experimental drugs he and his colleagues had ever produced and pumped her full of them. So Nicholas made a copy of the necessary files, snapped the lids onto several Petri dishes, and stuffed everything into his briefcase. Then he tendered his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day he rented a vacant butcher shop and spent a significant amount of his liquid assets equipping it. The place was in the middle of an industrial neighborhood, surrounded by decaying warehouses on three sides and a rail yard on the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painting over the windows, he worked feverishly to convert the shop into part lab, part operating theatre. He installed everything necessary for blood work and biopsies, then put together an imaging centre of sorts, including an ultrasound and a used X-ray unit. Against one wall he placed a rack for a dozen rat cages; against the other he put two blue plastic-lined bins for animal waste. He&amp;rsquo;d use the animals to perform toxicity and side-effects tests&amp;mdash;at least whatever time would allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long after visiting hours had ended, the corridor was silent save for the occasional nightmare-inspired moan or distant sputum-laden cough. Unseen, Nicholas slipped past the sleepy duty nurse and crept into Marissa&amp;rsquo;s darkened room. Her eyes were closed and her chest rose and fell with a wheezing irregularity. It had been a week since his last visit&amp;mdash;he&amp;rsquo;d been busy prepping his lab and beginning the first series of live animal experiments&amp;mdash;and her condition had so deteriorated Nicholas was shocked into momentary inaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked hollowed out, her cheeks sunken, her eyes dark bruises, her long glorious hair all but gone from the futile regimen of radiation and chemotherapy. Nicholas picked up her hand; it was limp and damp, like holding a drowned kitten. She stirred and groaned softly, her eyes fluttered open, startling him. Her red pupils were dilated. &amp;ldquo;Nicholas?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wh . . . why . . .&amp;rdquo; She floated groggily in a sea of painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stroked her forehead gently. &amp;ldquo;Why what, Marissa?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why . . . did you . . . do this to me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas was taken aback. Did she know? She&amp;rsquo;d never mentioned it on any of his previous visits. Or was she just delirious, talking about something else, an errant memory swimming up through the analgesics? He searched her face, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell. She swallowed and closed her eyes. In a moment her breathing slowed and, although shallow, became regular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because I love you,&amp;rdquo; Nicholas said, kissing her lightly on the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He carefully detached the IV drips, sliding the needles from her velum skin, dribbling bright red lines on her thin arms. Peeling back the tape, Nicholas removed two catheters. Cradling her like a newborn, he lifted and placed her in the wheelchair he&amp;rsquo;d brought. He made for the elevator, passing the now empty nursing station, and down to street level. He rolled her through the emergency room, past incurious, dazed eyes lost in their own pain, and out to his waiting van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please, Nicholas, let me die.&amp;rdquo; Marissa&amp;rsquo;s voice was raspy; it was the first time she&amp;rsquo;d addressed him directly in a week. Usually when she spoke it was to phantoms; occasionally she sang snatches of children&amp;rsquo;s songs. But for the last hour she&amp;rsquo;d followed his movements around the room from where she was strapped to the gurney, repeating her plea like a mantra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas increased her morphine dose 2 milligrams. &amp;ldquo;Please&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; she started again, then shuddered, lapsing into abrupt silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas felt a sharp pang of guilt; she hadn&amp;rsquo;t really needed the analgesic. But his nerves were raw. And now, of all times, it was critical that he be able to concentrate. For three weeks he worked on culturing trophoblasts from Marissa&amp;rsquo;s eggs and his sperm. Of the dozen of cultures he&amp;rsquo;d started, only one cell line was still viable. Nicholas filled a syringe with half of the murky fluid in which her final hope swam, slid it into a vein in her arm, then thumbed the plunger, firing his magic bullets at their targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marissa rallied and Nicholas allowed himself a faint hope. In the days that followed, her tumors began to shrink. In the next two weeks her progress was astonishing; her recovery seemed a certainty. Nicholas was joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then her remission came to a crashing halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her tumors began reasserting themselves. Nicholas applied a second course of treatment. It used up the last of his engineered cells. Only this time her rally lasted for no more than forty-eight hours. The cancer made up for its temporary abatement with a deadly new efficacy. Fresh lymphomas, carcinomas and myelomas appeared. Lumps developed in her breasts and uterus. Her left iris flecked with the black spots characteristic of melanoma of the eye and her nose developed ulcerating sores. Her beautiful, once pristine skin, slowly receded under masses of brown lesions and the red-purple nodules of Kaposi&amp;rsquo;s sarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esophageal cancer ravaged her throat, reducing her cry to an unrecognizable rasping noise. When an x-ray revealed the dark spots of several gliomas in her brain tissue, Nicholas finally understood her cancer-riddled organs were beyond even his powers of redemption. In days, perhaps hours, Marissa would succumb. He&amp;rsquo;d lost again. Six weeks to the day after he&amp;rsquo;d brought her here, exhausted and filled with desperate anguish, he pulled her off life support, then lay next to her on the gurney and wept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his belief that he was feeding the cancers more than her, Nicholas kept her IVs attached. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear to starve her to death. He loved her too much for that. So she lingered another day. And then the next. For a whole week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two long weeks the cancers continued their rampage. She barely looked human. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a single centimeter of her ivory skin left; although she was still vaguely Marissa shaped, she was a mass of lesions, waxy brown lumps and suppurating tumors. Her left eye was dark with clotted blood. It swelled and crusted over, forcing her lid perpetually open. Nicholas leaned over to examine the brown, distended globe; he touched it with the tip of his latex-clad finger and it popped, spattering his cheek with a yellowish-white pus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could she be alive? Nicholas hadn&amp;rsquo;t a clue. Unless . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snatch of conversation he&amp;rsquo;d once had with Marissa came back to him, one of the few times he&amp;rsquo;d talked to her about his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t cancer caused by a mutation?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; she&amp;rsquo;d asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;d answered in the affirmative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;And isn&amp;rsquo;t that also how new species evolve?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He conceded the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;So maybe cancer is a new form of life struggling to express itself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time he&amp;rsquo;d tried to explain the naiveté of her point. But now Nicholas wondered if he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been the naïve one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another week passed. Nicholas&amp;rsquo; lab filled with the stench of death, of the bacterial products of decay: histamine, putrescine and cadaverine. But instead of killing her, the tumors commandeered her organs and stabilized them, creating dark, clotted doppelgangers. The smell diminished. New growths popped up, the cancers somehow activating long-dormant sequences of DNA. Strange, misshapen organs proliferated inside her abdominal walls and thoracic cavity. They pulsed with life and dark fluids passed around and through them, sustaining her. Her blood-starved skin cracked and peeled, then sloughed off in broad swatches, revealing a brown carapace beneath. Where her mouth had been was a blistered oval. Something that might have been a tongue twisted in its depths. Two brown, fibrous orbs had replaced her albinic eyes, twitching in dark sockets, mimicking the movements of real eyes. But did they see anything? Nicholas had no way of knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marissa was alive. He stared at her, incredulous, and appalled. How could he love such a monster? Yet he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When blood formed dangerous, fetid pools in her new organs, Nicholas disensanguinated her. He washed the blood from the floor with a hose, spraying it into runoff channels. A brown sludge now circulated in her sclerotic veins. A few days later he cut out her fibrous, atrophied heart. It had no appreciable effect on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marissa, his Marissa, made odd, ululating sounds, turning her head back and forth as if trapped in a nightmare. Nicholas discontinued the morphine. She calmed. However, when he approached, her head swiveled and her body strained towards him, as if she wanted him to comfort her. Nicholas pulled on his latex gloves and stroked her striated forehead. She relaxed. A dark arm pressed against his thigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though nobody else in the world could possibly have understood the mangled word, Nicholas did. Marissa, his Marissa, had called his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholas peeled off his gloves; he reached out and, for the first time since he&amp;rsquo;d brought her here, touched her directly. Her skin was stippled with waxy bumps and felt cool beneath his fingertips. Yet, in that moment, he could not have loved her more. She stirred when he touched the prominence of her breast. The nipples had rotted and fallen off nearly a month ago, but the rest of the breast had hardened into a shape that remained true to Marissa&amp;rsquo;s. He stroked her the way she liked. Marissa groaned, arching against the restraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as he had done so long ago, Nicholas feathered the back of his hand down her belly, felt tiny invisible hairs rise to meet his knuckles. As soft as a breeze, his hand slid between her legs, his long index finger straightening into the mucilaginous warmth&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single drop of brownish fluid ran down his finger to his knuckle and fell onto the table. Nicholas had an erection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She called out his name again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing onto the gurney, Nicholas straddled Marissa. Her head rose to meet his, her lipless mouth fitting precisely over his&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;and something pointed and greasy tore across his tongue like a rasp. He jerked his head back, tasting his own welling blood, and something else too: the pang of loneliness, abandonment and dark, brackish coffee. The taste of cancer. He leaned forward and kissed her harder this time, pressing his face against hers, his weight fully on her chest, her blistering breath forced down his throat, scalding his esophagus like bad scotch, unfurling in his lungs, settling contentedly there. He kept his lips on her, one minute, two minutes, almost three. Then pulled back, gasping for air. His heart hammered desperately; his vision blurred. Losing his balance, he toppled backwards off the gurney, felt ribs crack when he hit something that jutted from the cold floor, though he couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite think what it might be, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t really bother him all that much. Nicholas&amp;rsquo; limbs twitched uselessly as he convulsed. But bit by bit his body stilled as the cure took hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows that if you surf the web long enough, you’ll see some pretty sick
shit. This is especially true if you intentionally dwell into the dark underbelly
of the internet. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen quite a few things I don&amp;rsquo;t care to admit to, but one
thing that I’ll always remember is a site called &amp;ldquo;normalpornfornormalpeople.com&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first strange thing about the site was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it by actually
looking for it. It was e-mailed to me by someone I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. The e-mail was as
follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hi there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;found this site is very nice thought u might like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;normalpornfornormalpeople.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pass it on, for the good of mankind&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty standard issue chain letter, although the url and the last remark really
piqued my curiosity. I was having a very boring day when I got this, so I made
sure my anti-virus was working and then I clicked on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very average, very generic looking site. It gave the impression that the
creators just BARELY gave a shit about making it look professional. The author
seemed to have a very tenuous grasp on English, and on the front page was a long,
boring, and incoherent rant that I don’t remember or have saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site had a strange tagline (which even today people haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out the
meaning of), which was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Normal Porn for Normal People, A Website Dedicated To The Eradication of Abnormal
Sexuality&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from the sound of that, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether I was here to watch porn or if
I had stumbled onto some kind of eugenics program. But I was here now, and I was
very, very curious to see what &amp;ldquo;Normal People&amp;rdquo; get their rocks off to. So I
scrolled down through the rant and&amp;hellip; nothing. The page didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to link to
anywhere else, and I was about to leave when I noticed every word of the rant was
its own hyperlink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I clicked one of them, and was sent to a white page with very long list of
links in the form of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;normalpornfornormalpeople.com/(random letters)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I stopped for a minute and asked myself if I really wanted to waste God knows
how much time clicking random links that will likely give me a virus that will
rape my computer. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just try it for maybe five minutes, just to see
if anything came up. I clicked one of the links, and was sent to another page.
This page apparently had totally different urls than the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just about to say &amp;ldquo;Fuck this&amp;rdquo; when I clicked on the third link, and a video
download came up. It was called &amp;ldquo;peanut.avi&amp;rdquo;. It was a thirty-minute video of a man,
a woman and a dog in a kitchen. The woman would make a peanut butter sandwich, and
the man would set it down for the dog to eat. This was all that happened, for
thirty minutes. It was obvious that the cameraman had to stop filming and wait
until the dog was ready to eat again, and the dog seemed rather sick by the end of
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking: &amp;ldquo;What the hell does that have to do with porn?&amp;rdquo; I have
no clue. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a little over two dozen videos from this site, and the
majority had no sexual activity at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching peanut.avi, I went on a certain image board I frequent to play
online show and tell, like I always do with weird shit like this. But someone had
already made a thread about it, some guy who had received the same chain letter I
did. The image board thread got lots of people with nothing better to do to dig
through the site, and that&amp;rsquo;s how I saw other videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of those two dozen videos were very uneventful, and consisted of people
talking to the cameraman in a room with nothing in it but a desk and a few chairs.
I mean literally nothing on the walls, or in terms of furniture. The whole room
had a very cold, sterile feel to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversations were just idle banter about previous jobs or embarrassing
childhood moments. I kept expecting some kind of discussion about what the people
were filming or what the site was about, but of course, nothing. You would never
know these videos had anything to do with porn if you saw it out of context. I
will say one thing though, the people who appeared in these videos were quite
attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the other videos that actually did feature content which I suppose could
be called &amp;ldquo;sexual&amp;rdquo; is where things got weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give brief descriptions of the stranger videos; if you&amp;rsquo;re really eaten up
with curiosity you can try to hunt them down on a torrent site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;lickedclean.avi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ten-minute video filmed by a hidden camera in which we see a repairman working
on a washing machine for the first two minutes. When it&amp;rsquo;s fixed, the repairman
talks to the owner briefly, and then leaves. The owner checks to make sure the
repairman is gone, and he begins to lick all over the top of the washing machine.
This goes on for seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;jimbo.avi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A five-minute video of an obese mime performing his act. It was actually pretty
funny, particularly one part where he pretends to pull up a chair, then pretends
that it breaks because of his weight. In the last thirty seconds of the video,
the camera cuts to static briefly and cuts back to the man sobbing quietly, still
wearing mime outfit and makeup. Some kind of obscure fetish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;dianna.avi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four-minute video in which the camerman talks to a woman in a room different from
the &amp;ldquo;interview room&amp;rdquo;. This room looks like one you’d find in a normal person&amp;rsquo;s
house. Exactly where they are is never specified, as Dianna only talks about her
violin playing. She obviously plays her violin, but she keeps getting distracted
by something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this until someone on the image board thread pointed it out, but
if you look at the mirror in the background, you can see a fat man in a chicken
mask masturbating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;jessica.avi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another four-minute cameraman video. This time he&amp;rsquo;s outside a house, talking to
another young woman. They talk about canoe rides. The camera zooms out to reveal
the city streets behind them occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange thing is: No one so far has been able to identify where this street
is. Guesses have ranged everywhere from Europe to Australia to the Philippines,
but there&amp;rsquo;s yet to be a match for the street shown in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;tonguetied.avi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-minute video. The first five minutes consist of an elderly woman making out
with a mannequin. The video cuts out like it did in jimbo.avi halfway through,
and the scene is now a group of mannequins huddled together in a circle around
the camera. The lights have been dimmed, and the elderly woman is nowhere to be
seen. From this point on, there is no sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;stumps.avi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-minute-long video where a man with no legs is attempting to breakdance on a
DDR mat in what looks like the kitchen from peanut.avi, but much dirtier. There&amp;rsquo;s
a radio playing music unseen in the background, but it stops at the four minute
mark when the man collapses on the mat in exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He breathes heavily and pleads with someone off-screen to let him rest. This
off-screen person becomes terrifyingly enraged and yells at him to keep dancing,
which he does. You can hear this off-screen person begin to scream as the video
ends abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;privacy.avi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman from dianna.avi is masturbating on a mattress in the &amp;ldquo;interview room&amp;rdquo;,
while the man from stumps.avi walks around on his hands while wearing some kind
of goblin mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door in this room was always closed in other videos, but it&amp;rsquo;s now open. In
this video the only light is in the room, and the hallway is dark. Near the end
of the video, you can see an animal quickly run through the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the last video we uncovered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;useless.avi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry chimpanzee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this eighteen-minute video, a blonde woman from one of the previous interview
videos is tied down to a mattress in the interview room. She attempts to scream
but her mouth is taped over. After seven minutes, a man in a black suit and mask
opens the door, but he does not enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He holds the door open for the animal that was running in the hall in the previous
video. It&amp;rsquo;s revealed to be an adult chimpanzee, its hair shaved and its entire body
painted red. It seemed to be starved and abused, with several wounds along its
shoulders and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the chimp enters the room, the masked man closes the door behind it. The
chimpanzee sniffs the air for a moment (it may have been blind), and notices the
woman tied to the mattress. It goes into a frenzy, and begins to maul her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assault goes on for a grueling seven minutes, until the woman finally dies.
The chimp eats flesh from her corpse for four minutes as the video ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thread exploded with activity after this video was uncovered, and people
discussed it long into the night. When I came back to the image board the next
day I found that the thread was deleted. I tried to start another one, and they
banned me. I tried e-mailing the guy who sent me the chain letter with the site&amp;rsquo;s
url, sent him five messages and never got a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to discuss this website on various places, and I got banned
frequently. The site itself was also deleted about three days after
useless.avi was uncovered, likely because someone contacted the authorities about
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only proof that normalpornfornormalpeople.com ever existed was a few
screencaps people took, and videos from the site that people saved and uploaded
on torrents. The most popular of which being useless.avi, which found its way
onto a few gore sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever you upload them to, all of the videos from normalpornfornormalpeople.com
get deleted after a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;float-right&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/midnight-game/Candle.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/midnight-game/small-Candle.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Candle&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Midnight Game&amp;rdquo; is an old Pagan ritual, typically performed as punishment for those who had broken the laws of the Pagan religion in question. While it was also used as a scare tactic to not disobey the gods, there is still a very existent chance of death to those who play the Midnight Game. There is an even higher chance of permanent mental scarring. It is highly recommended that you DO NOT PLAY THE MIDNIGHT GAME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for those few thrill seekers searching for a rush, or for those delving into obscure occult rituals, these are simple instructions on how to play. Do so at your own risk&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;instructions&#34;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;PREREQUISITES:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It must be exactly 12:00 AM when you begin performing the ritual. Otherwise, it will not work. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;MATERIALS:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;You will need a candle, a piece of paper, a writing implement, matches or a lighter, salt, a wooden door, and at least one drop of your own blood. If you are playing with multiple people, they will need their own set of the aforementioned materials and they will have to perform the steps below accordingly.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;STEP 1:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Write your &lt;strong&gt;full&lt;/strong&gt; name (first, middle, and last) on the piece of paper. Put at least one drop of blood on the paper. Allow it to soak into the paper.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;STEP 2:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Turn off all the lights in the place you are doing this. Go to your wooden door and place the paper with your name in front of it. Now, take out the candle and light it. Place it on top of the paper.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;STEP 3:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Knock on the door twenty-two times. The hour must be 12:00 AM upon the final knock. Then, open the door, blow out the candle, and close the door. You have just allowed the &amp;ldquo;Midnight Man&amp;rdquo; to enter your house.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;STEP 4:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Immediately relight your candle.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the game begins. You must now lurk around your now completely dark house with the lit candle in your hand. Your goal is to avoid the Midnight Man at all costs, until 3:33 AM. Should your candle ever go out, that means the Midnight Man is near you. You must relight your candle in the next ten seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not successful in doing this, you must then immediately surround yourself with a circle of salt. If you are unsuccessful in both of your actions, the Midnight Man will create a hallucination of your greatest fear and rip out your organs one by one. You will feel it, but you will be unable to react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are successful in creating the circle of salt, you must remain in there until 3:33 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are successful in relighting your candle, you may proceed with the game. You must continue to 3:33 AM without being attacked by the Midnight Man or trapped inside the circle of salt to win the Midnight Game. The Midnight Man will leave your house at 3:33 AM, and you will be safe to proceed with your morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;ADDITION:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Indications that you are near the Midnight Man will include a sudden drop in temperature, seeing a pure black, humanoid figure through the darkness, and hearing very soft whispering coming from an indiscernible source. If you experience any of these, it is advised that you leave the area to avoid the Midnight Man.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DO NOT turn any of the lights on during the Midnight Game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DO NOT use a flashlight during the Midnight Game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DO NOT go to sleep during the Midnight Game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DO NOT attempt to use another person&amp;rsquo;s blood on your name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DO NOT use a lighter as a substitute for a candle. It will not work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AND DEFINITELY DO NOT attempt to provoke the Midnight Man in ANY WAY.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the game is over, he will always be watching you&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, you are going to need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>12 Minutes</title>

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/12-minutes/WSBTV.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/12-minutes/WSBTV.png&#34;  alt=&#34;WSB-TV 2 ATLANTA&#34;   loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1987, local news channel WSB-TV 2 of Atlanta, Georgia was attempting to fill a scheduling gap in their Sunday morning line-up. After a few solicitations by local business owners, they decided to allow the young Reverend Marly Sachs to take the available hour block to do a religiously themed show. It premiered October 18th with little promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show was standard religious fare and consisted of the reverend sitting in a simple chair reading passages from the Bible to the camera and discussing their interpretation and significance to our modern, day-to-day life. The show received a reasonable number of viewers and continued to be shown into early December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then that the studio began to receive extremely strange complaints from the viewers of &amp;ldquo;Words of Light with the Rev. Marly Sachs&amp;rdquo;. The calls were from women (and women only), who vaguely referred to uncomfortable feelings they had at very specific intervals during the program. They described feelings of nausea, back pain, dizziness, and blurred vision. These callers, for no discernible reason, were convinced that it was the viewing of the program that was causing these symptoms. It was later determined after three weeks of complaints that these &amp;ldquo;feelings&amp;rdquo; were happening at roughly twelve minute intervals during the course of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small studio staff checked all recording equipment, both audio and video, and found nothing faulty. When the Reverend was made aware of these incidents, he merely shrugged and stated, cryptically, that &amp;ldquo;Some can’t handle the voice of God&amp;hellip;” The head of the studio, at a loss to explain the cause of these complaints, decided to continue running the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By February, viewership had dropped sharply, and it was decided to pull the plug on the show. The studio head figured it would be more prudent to spend as much time as possible on the news story that had the other two local news networks a-buzz: the miscarriage epidemic. Starting sometime in November, the number of healthy pregnant women miscarrying in the Atlanta metropolitan area had reached over three-hundred. The CDC could find no discernible cause for this terrifying occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reverend took the show&amp;rsquo;s cancellation with what could only be described as abject indifference. When informed, he made no protest, merely nodded, almost knowingly. He left the studio after the last episode was filmed without so much as a word and dropped off the face of the earth. No one ever heard from him again, not his former congregation nor any member of the church. The studio moved on, filling the slot with an infomercial, and continued to concentrate on the miscarriage story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year and a half later, an intern at the WSB studios discovered the tapes of the &amp;ldquo;Words of Light&amp;rdquo; and began going through them in an attempt to find stock footage for an upcoming piece the station was doing on the impact religion had on the city. The Atlanta Incident (as the miscarriage epidemic became known in medical journals) petered out three months after the studio cancelled Reverenced Sachs&amp;rsquo; show, and had already began to fade from the public consciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/12-minutes/Bg4.jpg&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/12-minutes/Bg4.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Bg4&#34;   title=&#34;One of the still frames of the severed head.&#34;  loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;One of the still frames of the severed head.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the intern went through the tapes, he accidentally made a disturbing discovery about the footage. While attempting to stop one recording at ten minutes and forty-five seconds, he mistakenly jammed the fast-forward button down. While the footage whizzed by, he attempted to pry up the button with a screwdriver. Just as he succeeded, the tape stopped at thirty-two minutes and one second. The intern actually fell out of his chair when he looked up at what was frozen on the screen: the image of a badly decomposed severed head filling up the entire frame. After he collected himself, he moved the film back a few frames, then forward, and realized that his mind was not playing tricks on him. He began going through the rest of the recording and soon discovered that at exactly twelve minute intervals, the image would appear for one frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking it some practical joke being played on the new guy, he presented it to one of the film technicians, ready to be mocked. The technician was just as puzzled as him. No one had touched the footage since the cancellation of the show. After the studio had closed for the night, the intern convinced the tech to help him go through all the tapes of the &amp;ldquo;Words of Light&amp;rdquo;. They discovered that every single episode had this same horrifying anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also realized that as the show progressed, the image had become more disgusting, as maggots began to eat away at the loose flesh and pieces of hair and skin seemed to fall off exponentially. The tech made clear to the intern that what they were seeing was technically impossible, since the film itself showed absolutely no signs of splicing. And he himself had been at every filming of the show and knew of no time when this image could have been inserted into the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this was presented to the studio head, who, fearing some kind of backlash over allowing this to get on the air, ordered all the tapes destroyed. He told the intern and tech that he had no interest in knowing who did it at this point, only that, &amp;ldquo;…covering their collective asses is all that’s important now.&amp;rdquo; He demanded that they mention this to no one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech easily moved on, remembering the incident as a darkly funny personal anecdote, but the intern wouldn’t let it go. He made copies of as many tapes as he could before they were wiped, and took them to see if he could find anything else in them that might point to who did this or why they would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, he attempted to rope the tech into helping him again, saying that he believed he had discovered something even more disturbing than the images themselves: when the single frames were edited together in chronological order, the head&amp;rsquo;s mouth appeared to be moving, as if trying to form words. The tech, fearing for his job, told him to get rid of the copies and not talk about it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, police responded to a 911 call made by an elderly woman in one of the Atlanta suburbs at dusk. She had heard horrible noises coming from her next door neighbor’s house, where a young couple lived. She told the emergency responder that the wife was pregnant and that she was terrified that something had happened. When the officers arrived on the scene twenty minutes later, they found no lights on in the windows and the front door ajar. They moved in slowly and made their way into the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside they found a young woman, dead, with her abdomen slashed open. The wound was jagged, and a trail of blood led from the body to the couch on the far end of the room. There sat her husband, the studio intern, naked, the corpse of his unborn child at his feet, dying. In his hand, he held the rusty piece of metal siding he had used to gut his pregnant wife. The television was on and playing an eighteen-second loop of silent footage of a decomposing head mouthing some unintelligible words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story at the police precinct to this day goes that the intern kept saying under his breath, over and over again as they led him away: &amp;ldquo;The light of God calls them&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>NoEnd House 2 -- Maggie</title>
		<link>https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/noend-house-2/</link>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been three weeks since I heard any word from David. In the six months since we started dating we had only gone three days without talking, and that was after a pretty intense fight. There was nothing out of the ordinary when I had talked to him last, he had just mentioned that he was going to check something out a friend told him about. But then I got a really weird text the night before. It was from David, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t from his number. It only had five words in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;no end dont come david&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was wrong. After I read that text I felt nauseous, like I was seeing something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. I decided to get a hold of Peter, but I had talked to this ass before. He was a deadbeat, but at least he might have some information on where David might be. I decided to log onto AIM with David&amp;rsquo;s account. I figured it would be easier to start something with Peter if he didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was me. When I logged on, he immediately messaged me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David?! Holy shit you had me worried I thought you went to the house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;NoEnd House, man, that place I told you about I could have sworn you were gonna go.&amp;rdquo; NoEnd. This guy knew what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah, I actually couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try again tomorrow. Where was it again?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No way, you already had me worried fuck that place I&amp;rsquo;ve been there you do not want to go there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Peter. This is Maggie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wait what? Where&amp;rsquo;s David?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I thought you would know but apparently not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh shit. Oh shitshitshitshit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What? Seriously Peter you need to tell me what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think he went to the house. It&amp;rsquo;s outside of town, maybe four miles down Terrence St. Unmarked road turn right. Shit, man, he&amp;rsquo;s gone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t think he is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you planning on doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get him back&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the next night at around eight. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a single car the entire trip, and as I turned onto the unmarked street I saw a sign pointing down the road:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoEnd this way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open 24hrs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My breathing hadn&amp;rsquo;t been steady since I left my house, and seeing the house didn&amp;rsquo;t help. There weren&amp;rsquo;t any other cars around, which made me think that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t open. A light from the front stoop illuminated the surrounding area, and the windows showed that lights were on inside. I parked my car, walked up to the front, and made my way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front lobby was normal enough, but as I predicted there wasn&amp;rsquo;t anyone there. All the lights were on, but no one was there. Besides the door I came through, there was only one other. Posted next to it was another sign:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room 1 this way. Eight more follow. Reach the end and you win!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn&amp;rsquo;t what made my stomach sink. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t what stopped my heart. There was more below, scrawled and handwritten in red:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t save him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must have stood in the lobby for an hour. I was frozen. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to go on. Did I go through the door? Did I call the police? After reading the sign I decided that I may have bit off more than I could chew. I&amp;rsquo;m average height for a girl, but pretty thin. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to fight off some psycho that was holding David hostage. I decided calling the cops was the best thing to do, so I reached into my pocket and opened my phone to call. No service. The house must be blocking the signal, and it was basically in the middle of nowhere. I walked towards the entrance, figuring I&amp;rsquo;d find service outside. I reached to the knob and twisted, and nothing. It was locked. I shook it harder. Nothing. It was locked from the outside. I slammed my hands against the door and called out to anyone that could hear me. I knew it was useless, no one was out here except me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I felt a vibrate in my pocket. I reached down and looked at my phone. One unread text. At first I was really glad I had service, I was saved. Maybe the text was from David that he was alright. It was from a different number, one I didn&amp;rsquo;t have in my phone. I pressed open, and nearly dropped the phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t save yourself either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My entire body was shaking. I wanted to pass out. I was stuck there. A cell phone with no service, in a room with no exit. My eyes scanned the room, and landed on the door across the room. A gold ‘1&amp;rsquo; was mounted on the front; it looked like a room door in a hotel. The ground felt far away as I walked closer to the door. In a few moments I was within inches of it, and I placed my head against the wood and listened. All I heard was distant Halloween music. Just creepy instrumental music you&amp;rsquo;d hear at any haunted house. Suddenly I got a little calmer. David was always known for his pranks. He would tell me about these elaborate setups he and his friends would make for the new players on their soccer team. Somehow a smile found its way onto my face, and I opened the door without fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering the first room alleviated my fears even more. The room was a completely normal attempt at a haunted house, though rather lacking. In each corner was a scarecrow, but not even scary ones. They were the kind you used to see in grade school, with the big smiling faces. Paper ghosts hung from the ceiling, and a fan in the corner added a cold breeze that made them spin. Next to one of the scarecrows was again the only other door in the room. Printed on the front, similar to the first door, was a large ‘2&amp;rsquo;. I laughed and left this lame room behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I opened the door to room 2 I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see three feet in front of me. It was completely filled with a gray mist that smelled like rubber. I guessed there had to be some fog machine in here, and it must have been pumping this stuff for hours. There were no windows in the last room, so the ventilation must have been terrible. I walked slowly forward and let out a small shriek. I had bumped straight into a large robotic Jason Vorhees. His eyes flashed red and the knife in his hand went up and down in a jerky stabbing motion. My heart was racing, and if anyone was with me I would have felt incredibly embarrassed. I covered my mouth and made my way past RoboJason, the fog was getting to be a little much. I was beginning to feel lightheaded as I found the door to room 3. I placed my hand to the knob and jerked it back in pain. The knob was extremely hot. I placed my hand on the door itself and felt that it too was warm. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything from the other side, I put my ear up to the warm wood expecting to hear a fire and heard nothing. I assumed that it was just a warm, like they were pumping heat into it like the final room in the Mr Toad&amp;rsquo;s Wild Ride at Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the corner of my dress and wrapped it around my hand, turning the doorknob as fast as I could and I flung myself into Room 3. There was no fire. Just darkness, and it was freezing cold. Room 3 wasn&amp;rsquo;t like the other rooms. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t like the other rooms at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment I knew that something wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. I tried to make out anything in the room but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even see my hands grasping for the doorknob&amp;hellip; that now wasn&amp;rsquo;t there. I was trapped. I must have been turned around in the darkness, even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t move once I entered I must have gotten turned around in all this darkness. At that moment a light on the ceiling flashed on. A single spotlight pointing directly down, illuminating a small table, and on this small table was a flashlight. Even though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really see where I was going I moved forward, the light on the ceiling was enough to make my way to the table. As I reached for the flashlight I noticed a small tag attached to the handle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Maggie &amp;ndash; From Management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I finished reading the light above me turned off, and I was again left in the dark. I fumbled with the flashlight for a second before I was able to turn it on. From what seemed like every direction, a low and rumbling hum surrounded me. My heart was pounding and I started to spin in place, darting the beam of the flashlight all around me. There was nothing in the room, but after a while I noticed something terrifying. It could have been my imagination, but I could see a figure dart away at the last second wherever the beam of light hit. I began to panic. I started backing away from the small table, unsure which direction I was going. The hum was getting louder, and then I starting feel the presence of whatever it was that was dodging the light. My hands shook wildly as I frantically shined the light in whatever direction I could think of. It was always there, just barely escaping back into the darkness every time. But it was getting closer. My eyes started to well up with tears. I thought I was going to drop the flashlight I was shaking so badly, until I saw it. The light set directly on a small number ‘4&amp;rsquo;. It was written on a piece of paper and taped to a wooden door in the corner. I ran. I ran as fast as I could with the flashlight pointed directly in front of me. I could feel it behind me. The hum was getting louder and I thought I felt its breath on my neck. I was sprinting at this point, only a few more feet to go. In one motion I grabbed the handle, twisted and slammed it shut behind me. I was now in the fourth room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was outside. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the house anymore. What awaited me after opening the door to room 4 was what looked like a cave. I looked down to the ground, and I noticed something strange and disturbing. The ground wasn&amp;rsquo;t made of grass or rock or dirt, it was wood paneling. It was the same floor as in the previous rooms. This was room 4. Somehow I was still in that house. There were a few torches mounted to the side of the rock surrounding me, and the cave beyond was pitch black. The torches looked like they could be taken down, so I walked over to the closest one and unsheathed it from its mounting piece. My body was covered in sweat, and I slowly made my way into the cave. The hum was gone, hopefully for good. No other noise met me inside the cave, but there was a slight breeze. The cave seemed to go on forever, and I was walking for what felt like hours, until I saw a faint blue light. I walked toward it, cautiously but at a decent pace. The light was an opening, the end of the tunnel. I started walking a little faster, I always hated cramped spaces like caves and tunnels. In a few moments the exit was within feet, and before I knew it I was at the end. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly where I was. The end. At the exit of the cave, the ground dropped off to a cliff, and there was no other way to go. I looked back into the dark cave behind me. I knew there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any turns, it was a straight tunnel. I turned and looked down over the edge. What I saw made my stomach turn worse than it ever did before. What I saw was an ocean, water all around with nothing else in sight. The drop must have been a hundred feet, with a small rock formation at the bottom. After a few seconds of studying the rocks, my stomach turned more than I thought possible, and my body broke into a fresh sweat. The rocks formed a number. The rocks formed a ‘5&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood up and backed away from the edge. I hated heights. I was stopped by a wall that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been there. I turned around and was met with a terrifying sight. The cave was gone. I was face to face with a solid stone wall, the side of whatever mountain this was. I had to keep telling myself I was still in the NoEnd House. I didn&amp;rsquo;t leave. Clearly this isn&amp;rsquo;t an actual mountain. But it felt so real. I turned back and looked over the cliff again. There was no way. This house has been pretty messed up before now. I was outside for god&amp;rsquo;s sake. But what it expected me to do now was just too much. I knew what those rocks down there meant. That was the entrance to room 5. There was no stairs leading down, no other paths to use. I was trapped, again. The house wanted me to jump. The house wanted me to jump. I sank to the ground and curled into a ball. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. There was no way I could jump off a cliff onto a jagged rock formation a hundred feet below. My mind was split in two. I knew that I was still inside, but my surroundings screamed in my ear the opposite. I stayed there on the wooden ground for a while, at that point I had lost all concept of time. After what seemed like weeks I finally stood up. Slowly I made my way to the edge of the cliff and looked down. The giant ‘5&amp;rsquo; taunted me to jump. It knew I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it and it taunted me. And then the hum returned, the low and distant hum. It seemed to come from behind me, resonating within the mountain. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what came over me, but after hearing that sound, something inside me lit up. I clenched my eyes shut, and I jumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind was rushing up as I fell, and a deep fear washed over me. I was going to die. I was going to smash into those rocks and die. They were going to tear me apart and I was going to die. I didn&amp;rsquo;t dare open my eyes, I just fell. Even with the loud wind around me, the hum was now deafening. I just wanted it to be over. I just wanted it to be over I just wanted to hit the rocks and I wanted it to be over-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I stopped. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t falling anymore, but I never hit the rocks. I opened my eyes and looked around. I was standing on the familiar wood paneling of the house. The hum was gone, and silence took its place. I had made it. I was in room 5. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it happened, but I was in room 5. The feeling of dread was gone, I was just incredibly happy to be alive. After a few moments to collect myself I decided to look around at the rest of the room. My happiness left me fast. This room was empty. The walls matched the floor, and the ceiling matched the walls and the walls had no doors or windows. I was in a sealed box. Then I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t safe. I had made it out of the fourth room, but only to enter room 5, and there was no leaving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment I wondered if David had been in this room. I wondered if he had jumped off that hundred-foot cliff and ended up stuck in the room. And if he did, that means he got out. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t here, I was alone. He got out, and I would too. The thought of David escaping this room gave me new found confidence, and a second wind filled my spirit. I was going to get out of this room, find David, and get us the hell out of here. I walked around the perimeter of the wall and felt for any sort of inconsistencies. Nothing. The walls were flawless, barely a scratch on them let alone some secret exit. I started to knock at random places on the walls. They were completely solid. The confidence started to leave me. I was running out of ideas. And that&amp;rsquo;s when she spoke to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maggie. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have come here, Maggie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly jumped out of my skin if that was possible. I was still facing the wall, and the voice had come from the middle of the room. The voice was that of a little girl&amp;hellip; at least that&amp;rsquo;s what it sounded like. I turned around slowly, and my eyes fell on who spoke to me. I was right, a little blond girl, no more than seven years old with light blue eyes and a long white dress. She smiled at me and spoke again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But now that you&amp;rsquo;re here, let&amp;rsquo;s play a game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was something horrifying about that little girl. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t scary like those horror girls are in those Japanese movies. She looked completely normal. If I saw her walking down the street I would have just walked right on by. But looking into her eyes, I felt complete terror. Jumping off of a cliff was scary, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t jump off twenty cliffs twice as high if it meant I could take back one minute of looking into her soulless eyes. After a moment of staring, I finally spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What game? Who are you?&amp;rdquo; I mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you lose, you die.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If I win?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He dies.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart sank somewhere below my feet. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe what I was hearing, but I knew she was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Which will it be?&amp;rdquo; She smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Neither.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t know where I found the courage to talk back to this demon child, but I had come too far to just let David die. And if I died, this was all for nothing. No, I chose neither. But then I saw it. The reason the little girl terrified me. She was more than just a small child. Looking at her, I also saw what appeared to be a large man, covered in hair, with the head of a ram. It was a horrible sight. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see one without seeing the other. The little girl stood in front of me, but I knew her true form. It was the worst sight I had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Too bad.&amp;rdquo; And with that she was gone. I was alone again, in an empty and silent room. Only this time something was added. A small table where she stood appeared from nowhere, as though it was there the whole time. There was something on it, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell from where I was. I walked up to the table and looked at the small object. It was a small razor, like one you would find in an exacto knife. I reached out to pick it up and as I did a scream left my mouth. When my hand came into view, I saw something that was never there before. It looked as though something was branded into my skin, a single number 6. I looked back to the razor and noticed the tag attached to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Maggie &amp;ndash; From Management
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*thought you may need this*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the note, I started sobbing uncontrollably. Tears were rushing down my face harder than they ever have in my life. I had never cried like that and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever will again. I fell to the ground and sunk my head into the hard wood floor. I was sobbing for hours, just lying there on the ground. And then the crying stopped and depression set in. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why I was crying. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t about David, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t even about how I was stuck there. There were still no doors in this room, I was still trapped. But that&amp;rsquo;s not why I was sad. I was in the deepest depression possible. Complete and emotionless depression. I felt empty, and clawed my way up from the ground and steadied myself against the table. My eyes fell on the razor, and I picked it up. I was going to kill myself. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle it any more. I had had it. David was probably dead. I was trapped in here. It was over. I pressed the razor against my wrist, right above the 6 that had appeared on my skin. The sobbing came back, and I just stood there, crying with the razor pressed against my wrist. David was dead, I was about to die. Nothing mattered anymore, and with one deep cut, I sliced down my wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after slicing down my wrist I was no longer in room 5. I didn&amp;rsquo;t die, I knew that for sure. The depression was gone, but I was by no means happy. Tears were still finding their way down my face. The room I was in was similar to the one previous, and again, it had no doors. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any lamps, but somehow I was still able to see everything clearly. The room was completely empty, but before I had time to think of what to do next it went dark, and the hum from before returned. I covered my ears in protest, it was louder than it ever was. But it was over in a moment, and the lights returned, only this time something was added to the room. And then I screamed. There in the middle of the room, strung up by chains and naked from the waist up was David. It looked like he was tortured, knife wounds littered his chest and arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;DAVID!&amp;rdquo; I ran up to him as fast as I could. He was conscious, I saw his chest move up and down, but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t speaking. And that&amp;rsquo;s when I noticed what was etched into his chest. I dropped to my knees as I saw it. The 7 stared at me as though it had eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard David try and speak, and I got to my feet and got as close as I could to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David! David, can you hear me?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maggie… what&amp;rsquo;re you… what&amp;rsquo;re you doing here?&amp;rdquo; His voice was slight, but he was talking and I was thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to save you. How do I get you down?&amp;rdquo; There were large padlocks on the chains holding him in place. I looked around the room for any sort of key, but all I found was a small knife in one of the corners. The metal was way too thick for that knife to even dent it, so I disregarded it as useless. I went back to David, it looked like he was on the verge of death, and then I felt my pocket vibrate. It startled me something awful, I took the phone out of my pocket. As I suspected, one unread text. I flipped open the phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That isn&amp;rsquo;t me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to think. David was right there in front of me, but that text was from the first number that contacted me. It as the first text I received from David that mentioned the NoEnd House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maggie…&amp;rdquo; I heard his voice clearly with my ears and my mind. It seemed like his voice was coming from all sides. &amp;ldquo;Maggie… You have to go on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What are you talking about? How?&amp;rdquo; I was face to face with David, or whoever it was that was chained up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That knife…&amp;rdquo; he made a slight movement of his head toward the corner. &amp;ldquo;Go get it.&amp;rdquo; I ran and was immediately back with the knife clenched in hand within a few seconds. I had no idea what was going on, but I needed to save him and would do anythi-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now stab me in the chest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;…what?&amp;rdquo; I was shocked. David hung there, staring directly into my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have to run that knife through the seven on my chest. It&amp;rsquo;s the only way to save us both.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No…&amp;rdquo; I stumbled backward. &amp;ldquo;No, you&amp;rsquo;re not making any sense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maggie!&amp;rdquo; He was screaming now, his eyes looked frantic. The side of his mouth curled into a twisted grin. &amp;ldquo;Maggie, stab me now, it&amp;rsquo;s the only way!&amp;rdquo; I looked down at the knife in my hand, my head felt as though it was being struck with a bat. I was at a complete loss. I clenched my eyes shut tight and felt the knife in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;MAGGIE!&amp;rdquo; And with a scream and a thrust I stabbed the knife into David&amp;rsquo;s chest. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what came over me, I just knew it was the only way. I opened my eyes and saw his face. It was terrified. Tears slid down his cheeks and David looked me in the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why… did you… do that…?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;rsquo;t fool me. I know that wasn&amp;rsquo;t David. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been, or else I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to stab him. I know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t I know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. His eyes rolled back as the life left him, but that&amp;rsquo;s when it changed. The seven on his body was gone, the blood dripped down onto the ground into a pool below me. The crimson liquid stretched out in every direction, the circle nearly filled the room, and I began to sink. I tried to move but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. It was like quick sand. The blood was up to my knees now. As much as I tried to struggle I just sank deeper. Up to my chest now. I clawed and scratched at the wood around me. The lifeless body of David hung above, his head facing me, smiling. The blood reached my neck. I was beyond terrified. Before long I was full submerged, and fell into darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, I was outside the house. I could feel the cold earth below me. I rolled onto my back and looked up at the night sky. The NoEnd House towered above me, complete with my car parked in the same spot. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether I should laugh or cry. I was out. I was out I was out I was out. I got up and dusted off my pants. My body was still shaking as I walked to my car, but a feeling of uneasiness washed over me. There was no way I escaped. The house wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just let me go. Something wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. I knew it. I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t kill David in the sixth room. I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t. But he was nowhere to be found. I reached down into my pocket and took out my phone. No unread messages. But I had service. I flipped it open and I began a text to David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where are you?&amp;rdquo; I wrote. Within a second of sending it I got a reply. I pressed open excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;room 10 your room 7 run.&amp;rdquo; and the deafening hum returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bolted. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know where I was going, but I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t outside. I was still in the house. The hum rattled everything around me. It shook the trees and the air itself. I just needed to find an 8. I needed to find the next room. That was my only chance. I needed to find room 8. The first few rooms were obvious, but as I progressed it was getting less and less clear where the rooms started and ended. I had no idea what I was looking for, anything that had a number on it. I needed to find an 8 I needed to find an 8 I needed to find-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unread text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;your address&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the hell did he mean? My address? I slid the phone back in my pocket, the hum was growing louder and louder. And that&amp;rsquo;s when it hit me. My address. My address. My address. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t be. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4896 Forest Ln.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit #8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slammed into my car and flung the door open. The hum shook the metal of the car and seemed to follow me inside. I floored it and made my way back down the dirt road toward my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this was making sense. How was room 8 my apartment? Should I have even trusted that text? It was from David. I know it was. There was no reason not to trust it. It took no time at all to drive to my complex, and honestly I didn&amp;rsquo;t even remember driving. It was like when you zone out for a minute and wake up farther down the road. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother locking it as I ran up to the front gate. My hands fumbled with the keys as I unlocked the bolt and made my way into the first hallway on the left. My complex was huge, but my apartment was one of the first ones on the left. I ran as fast as I could, passed 4, passed 5. My head was spinning, this night was weighing down on me like a lead vest. Passed 6. The farther I made it down the hallway, the farther away the hum seemed to be. As I passed unit 7 I could barely hear it anymore. And when I stopped in front of my unit I was in complete silence. I just stood there, standing in front of my apartment. The small gold ‘8&amp;rsquo; was at eye level with me. I reached for the doorknob and slowly slid my key in, twisted, and the door swung open and I was sucked in like a vacuum, the door slamming behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room 8. I got up off the floor and looked around. It was identical to my apartment. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t know any better I would have assumed that I was home and that this was a bad dream. My mind went to David, and wondered what room 8 was to him, what it was that the house showed him. I walked around and studied the area. Literally everything was how I left it, right down to the half eaten Chinese left out next to the sink. I looked over at my computer desk in the family room. The monitor was still on, and AIM was still up and running. I walked over and sat in front of it, scrolling through my conversation with Peter. It was there, word for word. The house knew all of this, and how I had no idea. To be honest, I tried my hardest not to think about it, the answer no doubt something I was better off not knowing. I tried to click out of AIM but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me. The computer just froze. I clicked shut down. Nothing. I clicked cntrl-alt-del. Nothing. I pressed the monitor&amp;rsquo;s power button. Nothing. And then a pop up appeared on screen. It was a video chat. I looked at the list of people in it, and there were two names. Maggie, and Management. The video feed was live, and all it showed was a grey wall. Then a message from Management popped into the text box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hope everything is how you left it :)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; I responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Enjoy the show :)&amp;rdquo; And that&amp;rsquo;s when the camera turned. The camera focused on a young man strapped to a surgical table. He was completely naked and sobbing quietly to himself. The image wasn&amp;rsquo;t that clear, but I thought I had recognized the man laying there. He was tall, short brown hair, and a fairly pale complexion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is what happens when people attempt to cheat :)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized who it was. Strapped to the surgical table was Peter Terry. And he wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to describe what I watched at that moment. The screams, the sounds that Peter made were unlike anything I ever heard out of a human. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look away. I wanted to, but I think it was the power of the room, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t look away. Peter let out one final soul-curdling scream, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear it through the computer speakers, it was coming from my room. My heart sank as I spun around towards the hallway. I got up off my chair, and I could still hear the screams emanating as I walked toward its source. I reached my bedroom door and the screams were now replaced by the hum. That hum. It had haunted me the entire time. I slowly opened the door, and I saw inside my room what I had seen on my computer. There was the surgical table, with whatever was left of Peter Terry strewn across its top. No one else was there. The others in the room were gone, but a chill went up my spine. The Management was here with me, only one room away. I walked closer to the table, the stench was horrific, and it took everything in me to stop from vomiting. I knew I was nearing the end. I had to be. I looked around the room. Somewhere in here was the entrance to the next room. I knew it had to be. And it was. But it was simpler than I had expected. Across the room, where my bathroom door should have been was a simple wooden door, similar to the early ones in the House. Something was stapled to the door, something long, and bloody. It was the entrails of Peter Terry, and they formed a 9 on the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt bad for Peter, but I had gone through hell that night. I walked right past the table, picked up a long surgical knife and didn&amp;rsquo;t give the body a second glance. The final door was there, and I walked right up to it. This night was about to end, and I was coming out of that room with David, and I was going to stop whoever it was that was keeping him here. The door opened easily, and as I stepped through I saw what was waiting for me. It was an empty room, it resembled a waiting room for a doctor&amp;rsquo;s office. There were a few chairs lining the wall and crumpled up old magazines in a basket in the corner. Across the room on the opposite side from where I came in, there stood a single door. My heart sank when I read the label printed on the wood. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a number. It was a single word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clenched the surgical knife in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alright, I&amp;rsquo;m fucking ending this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were on the other side of the door. I could feel it. And David was too. The hum was louder than it had ever been. I could feel it inside me. It was coming from inside me. As I walked it got louder, and as I placed a hand on the door the room was filled with the sound. I turned the knob and opened the door. The room waiting for me was not what I had expected. It was the front lobby. The same front lobby that began this entire hell. Only this time, there was someone behind the desk. My heart jumped out of my chest when I saw who it was. It was Peter Terry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello Maggie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Peter?&amp;rdquo; No, there was no way. &amp;ldquo;How? What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who were you expecting? A ghost? Satan? Some creepy little blond girl?&amp;rdquo; He was smiling. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What the hell is going on here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maggie. Come on. Just think for two seconds. Who first told David about this place?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You… didn&amp;rsquo;t…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who told you about David&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Goddammit Peter, you were his friend!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, Maggie, but that&amp;rsquo;s how we run business here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where is he? WHERE IS HE?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s in here with us in the House, Maggie. He isn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere, and neither are you.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t know what took over me, but I lost it. I jumped over the counter and shoved Peter to the ground. I grabbed him by the hair and slammed his head into the ground, the surgical knife in my other hand pressed firmly against his neck. I wanted to kill him. I had to kill him. He killed David. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t killing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maggie, you can&amp;rsquo;t. There&amp;rsquo;s always going to be someone to run the House.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo; I slid the knife across his throat and slammed his head further into the ground. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think there will be.&amp;rdquo; With his death the room went dark. I could still feel the surgical knife, but I was no longer holding on to Peter&amp;rsquo;s hair. I don&amp;rsquo;t know for how long I was in the darkness, but it felt like ages. I stood and felt for the desk, balancing myself with one hand on the side of the marble surface. Then the lights came on. I could see the windows across the room, it was still night out. I looked out and saw him. David was walking around outside, seemingly unharmed. I ran to the door and tried to open it. I was so happy. But the door wouldn&amp;rsquo;t budge. I tried my hardest, but the door wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me out. I looked out the window and saw David as he began to walk down the dirt road. I rested my head against the door and saw it. My stomach lurched hard. There, pinned to my chest was a name tag, with one word:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;war-experiments&#34;&gt;War Experiments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazi reign was famous for its backdoor scientists and occult researchers. Special expeditionary divisions of the Reich were often sent out in search of artifacts, or locations of occult or religious significance. Meanwhile, in Germany, bunkers were assembled and mansions and castles were fitted with labyrinths and dungeons, which were filled with strange experiments and research notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever the Allies found these places, they were often gutted, burned, or otherwise destroyed and abandoned. If a lab was found intact, the research was usually incoherent or missing, and would be later destroyed by the Allies to prevent the Nazis from recovering any data left behind. Thus, a lot of Nazi experiments were kept under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veterans who served as guards to these labs and ritual zones have explained what they saw, and folders and books have been uncovered in boxes and crates belonging to the scientists. A fair few of these materials contain a common research goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;giving-man-the-power-of-god&#34;&gt;Giving Man the Power of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact nature of true, godlike power has been debated upon, but in Nazi research, the concept is described as immortality, the inability to die, invincibility, or some other term surrounding losing the capacity to perish in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of this research was actually legitimately based on certain doses of chemical compounds that aid blood flow in aging people. The first concepts they discovered are now used in today&amp;rsquo;s transplant surgery, grafting, ointments that renew skin, antibodies to various diseases, and fitness/dieting research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one set of crates discovered in Hamburg in 1999 variated drastically from this research style. The material within cross-bred the occult experiments and immortality research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disease-of-the-mind&#34;&gt;Disease of the Mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introductory folders and proofs of concept begin with the principle that the brain controls the body completely and wholly, and, as the body slowly degrades around it, it continues to function. Further statements explain that the reason the body degrades is because the human brain is set on a biological timer, such as how mayflies only live for one day, yet other insects can last much longer. Essentially, the brain tells us to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is proposed that, as the brain grows, it begins to make connections, resulting in the human becoming more mature and advancing. Between the ages of 35 to 50, however, these connections slowly break down, resulting in forgetfulness, dementia, and other mental diseases reserved for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;their-proposal&#34;&gt;Their Proposal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;float-right&#34;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nazi scientists proposed that the brain has a &amp;ldquo;universal kill switch&amp;rdquo; that activates once it is fully developed. In all normal humans, this kill switch initiates a shutdown of bodily functions, which occurs over several decades. As soon as the body is fully shut down, the brain will be forced to die through lack of oxygenated blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that Werner&amp;rsquo;s Syndrome (a disease where a person ages rapidly) is a result of the kill switch function activating far too early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazis proposed that they could remove the kill switch and give the human mind immortality. From that would come complete immortality. Of course, brain surgery was still in its early stages of development during these times, but the procedure was possible. In the stacks of folders discovered, there were many different diagrams and pieces of research on the brain, psychology, the human mind, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-location&#34;&gt;The Location&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments were initially proposed to Nazi executives in 1940, and permission was granted to perform the experiments in 1942, under one condition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The experiments must be conducted outside of Germany. The German Populace must not witness this experiment in any way, shape, or form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was no surprise to the scientists that the Executives were paranoid about public relations, but the idea of performing the research outside of the fatherland was foreign in of itself. Most experiments were performed in bunkers or basements. Regardless, the scientists complied, and were able to organize a setup with their ally, Japan. In late 1942, the research had begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;carrying-out-the-experiments&#34;&gt;Carrying Out the Experiments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team had taken over a Japanese orphanage. The orphanage was in the hills, supposedly somewhere in Shimane, an area nearby Hiroshima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists deduced that if they involved the usual test subjects; old or diseased people with &amp;ldquo;nothing left to live for&amp;rdquo; (similar in a fashion to &lt;a href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/gateway-of-the-Mind&#34;&gt;Gateway of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;, they would be playing with an unknown variable, or, more specifically, they would be experimenting on a brain with an already activated kill switch, rendering it useless in the context of finding the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Nazi scientists demanded that children, namely the orphans in the orphanage (which they deemed to, again, &amp;ldquo;have nothing else to live for&amp;rdquo;), would become test subjects: their young brains eliminated any cause for concern of an already activated kill switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin the experiments, the children went through numerous immunizations and intense psychological testing. This ensured that defects would be prevented, and that a general benchmark would be kept for their subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they dealt with the older staff of the orphanage. Put under anesthetic, the surgeons opened up their skulls to map out a cross section of an adult brain, and began to find key differences between it and a child&amp;rsquo;s brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating a model of both a child and adult brain, the scientists deduced that the &amp;lsquo;universal kill switch&amp;rsquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t located in the main brain, but in the cerebellum, at the rear of the base. The cerebellum commands all subconscious activity in the brain, which is understandable, since activating the kill switch is not a conscious action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took the tallest child in the orphanage and opened her up, managing to incise the cerebellum and remove the section presumed to be the kill switch. However, upon closing the girl&amp;rsquo;s wounds, they found that she had expired. They assumed that the incisions on the brain had been too brash and required far more precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body was dumped in the forest behind the orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;success-presumably&#34;&gt;Success, Presumably&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After different tools were imported and new techniques developed, the scientists were finally able to remove the kill switch and successfully revive patients. In May 1943, they took one of the youngest girls in the orphanage and removed the kill switch; the only function she lost was the ability to sweat. After their assumed success, the scientists celebrated, and everyone went to sleep. The next morning, the girl did not wake up, and was revealed to be comatose. After a while, she was revived successfully, and the &amp;ldquo;kill switch-ectomies&amp;rdquo; continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;continuation&#34;&gt;Continuation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial success gave the doctors a new state of mind, one of refreshment. They were able to continue their experiments with the ease of mind that the theory was proven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. So they assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the doctors continued their grisly research, they commissioned several doctors from Moscow trained in the practice of bodily revival (technically zombification, but relying on the principals of electric shocks and artificial hearts to power the body back up). They stated the reason for this was that the original subject always become comatose or clinically dead after going to sleep, but had always managed to be revived in the morning. She had no signs of this behavior before the experiment, and despite the fact that she had never not been revived, the doctors did not want to risk a success turning into a failure. The Russian scientists were put to the task of bringing her back to life whenever she expired. After several days of this, the Nazis concluded that it was safe to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-venom&#34;&gt;Project Venom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Venom was a Russian experiment to create super soldiers from the theory of Dr. Frankenstein (it may also have formed a basis for the Marvel superhero as well). As a repayment for the use of the Russian scientists, Russia had asked that they combine the research of Project Venom with the Nazi&amp;rsquo;s ongoing experiments. Naturally, the Nazis agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the limited number of orphans was debilitating. As the Nazis required so many of them, they could only offer a single girl. The Russians were content, and began their proof of concept. They had artificially created an arm, over in Moscow, which was on its way to the orphanage to be grafted on, to prove that amputation and limb replacement could work. In the meantime, the Russians had to prepare for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl&amp;rsquo;s right arm was amputated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mysteriously, shortly after, the Russian scientists packed up their equipment and left. The replacement arm never came, and the girl was left with a bandage strapped over her kimono perpetually. The Russians were said to have left with a fearful haste, as if the air had suddenly turned too cold for their tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rebellion&#34;&gt;Rebellion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One child out of the whole orphanage did not approve of the scientist&amp;rsquo;s presence. In her acts of rebellion, she stole paperwork and ripped it to shreds, broke glassware, and wrecked surgery theaters. Despite her young age (8 years old) and size, she had a surprising capacity for destruction. It was noted in a journal that she was heterochromic as well (having brown and blue eyes from left to right). The senior scientists despised her, but could not restrain her without arousing suspicion. Instead, they ordered the Nazi soldiers to take care of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was brutally beheaded with a blunt bayonet. She was not buried, just left in the woods behind the orphanage. The soldiers told the caretakers that she had found a new family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;numerous-failures&#34;&gt;Numerous Failures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazi scientists attempted to play around with their successful experiment by attempting it in different ways. Sadly, none of these alternative methods worked. Here is a list of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entry through the forehead. Performed on a 10 year old boy. Skull was deformed and the boy had been virtually lobotomized by the end of it. As a result, the boy was not vegetative, but left severely mentally handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entry through the lower jaw. Performed on a 6 year old girl. The tongue and most of the flesh on the lower jaw was removed and could not be replaced. The subject&amp;rsquo;s sinuses were also scrambled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entry through the side of the head. Subject was made deaf in corresponding ear. It should also be noted that there was no anesthetic during this surgery. One journal read that the screams were &amp;ldquo;truly mortifying&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the failure of these procedures, the kill switches were still removed, and the subjects acted in much the same way as the first girl, expiring upon sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the previous failures reduced the orphan&amp;rsquo;s regular population to a mere 10 people. This only included the caretakers; they had performed surgery on all the children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kill-switch-reversal&#34;&gt;Kill Switch Reversal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors began to formulate a new idea. They theorized that, in a child, the kill switch wasn&amp;rsquo;t activated yet, but in an adult, a kill switch could be reversed using a chemical compound to eliminate the hormone produced. The kill switch could then be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure was eventually performed on all the caretakers. It was surprisingly successful, as they all survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personalities-gone-awry&#34;&gt;Personalities Gone Awry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the experiments, scientists were told to watch over the successful children and monitor their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;They appear normal at first, just like any of the other children, playing, cheering, learning regularly, but when separated from the others, they seem&amp;hellip; off. They stroll carelessly around with a blank smile on their face, their eyes looking straight at you. If approached from behind, their heads snap around with ungodly speed, and for a moment, you can almost see an expression so vile on their face that it makes you want to cower. But then you realize they are just forming that dreamy smile again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another thing is that they follow us, but only when we are on our own. After finishing with my typewriter and heading to my room, I am often given a fright by one of the children standing several meters down the dark hallway, staring at me. When I enter my quarters, she follows me, and I must jam a chair behind the door to sleep safely. It feels like they&amp;rsquo;re ghosts at night time. The funny thing is, I keep seeing one child with reddish hair. I ask who that child is the next morning, but the caretakers say they haven&amp;rsquo;t had a child with reddish hair for a while.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They also seem to be playing a game a lot more than when we started. I haven&amp;rsquo;t got much knowledge of Japanese, but it seems the game is named &amp;ldquo;Circle You, Circle You&amp;rdquo;, as described by one of the translators. A group of children surround one child, who sits in the center, alone. The group link arms and begin to move in a circular manner around the child, making scary faces at them and singing an eerie chant. You lose if you flinch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upon talking to them, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed they seem more dreamy, forgetful, and somewhat blank, as if the experiments have wiped their memories as well as their mortality. But it&amp;rsquo;s not an innocent type of dreamy, rather, something more sinister. They stare at you with wide eyes, and ask you questions you never thought they would know. One asked, &amp;ldquo;When your grandmother died, did she really leave you a gold plated watch?&amp;rdquo; It may seem crazy, but my honest answer was&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagome Kagome translates literally to Circle, Circle, but can also be called &amp;ldquo;Circle You, Circle You&amp;rdquo;. It should also be noted that the child who rebelled against the scientists was said to have had reddish hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demise&#34;&gt;Demise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 1945, Hiroshima was bombed. Germany surrendered, and the experiments were ground to a halt. The Germans began packing up their equipment. Most of them had already returned home due to &amp;ldquo;concerns over mental welfare&amp;rdquo;, stating that they showed signs of insanity. Only four scientists remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sending the last set of equipment off, the scientists deemed it only justified that they inform the caretakers that they were leaving. They did so, and to the horror of one of the scientists, and the surprise of the rest, the head caretaker said, in fluent German, &amp;ldquo;Will you play one last game with us?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three scientists agreed, and a circle of children and caretakers formed around them. &amp;ldquo;Now, if you flinch, you lose&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one horrified scientist ran to the last truck and jumped on it without looking back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story-now&#34;&gt;The Story Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you visit Hiroshima, go to the woods. You may find some dirt trails there; if you travel down them, you will see beautiful forests. But if you travel down one that has had signs of trucks going through, you will feel cold, and you will see that a lot of trees have been cut down. Don&amp;rsquo;t wander from the path, or you&amp;rsquo;ll likely get lost in those vast woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pay attention, you will notice that some of the tree stumps look like kneeling people, missing heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you continue, the air will get cold. Naturally, because you&amp;rsquo;re climbing uphill, right? Eventually, you will reach a clearing with an old stone building in the center, vines covering the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go inside if you want to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you open the door, a foul smell will be present, similar to that of a rotting corpse. If you look down the hall, it will be dark regardless of the time of day, since there are no lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue down the hall. Take the first left and walk until you see a door that appears to be made out of a red-colored wood (the rest are brown). Open the door. You will find ten happy children and caretakers, all wearing kimonos, playing in a normal playroom. One is missing her arm, another is missing his forehead, and a third lacks a jaw, but all are bandaged with clinical precision. The place should be very clean and tidy, dependent on your standard of such things, and well lit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At once, your presence will draw the attention of everyone in the room, including the ones that look far too preoccupied or distracted. They will turn to look at you, carefree smiles on each of their pleasant faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head caretaker, in all her beauty, will ask, &amp;ldquo;Will you come play with us?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t soiled your pants, you really should, to save yourself the trouble later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;, the door will slam shut on you. You can attempt to exit from where you came, but you will only find another dark hallway. Open any of the brown doors from earlier to discover operating tables or bunk beds. If you continue down the third hallway, you will realize that a girl is standing several meters behind you, her face shrouded by shadow. Approach her and expect your doom. Instead, continue down the hallway, and try not to let her catch up with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo;, however, you will be welcomed into the room. The door will close behind you, and everyone will form a circle around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now sit down and don&amp;rsquo;t flinch!&amp;rdquo; a cheerful voice will say. Just follow those instructions, and you will survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All light will disappear from the room, but you will still see the circle of children. Each will have a vicious expression on their face, ones so vile, you may flinch immediately. If you can stomach that, though, they will begin to slowly circle you. You may feel one of them lash towards you. If you look, however, there will be nothing there, besides the children circling normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, they will begin chanting &amp;ldquo;Kagome, kagome&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can&amp;rsquo;t explain any further. No one ever lives to tell the tale of what happens then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you flinch before they chant, they simply continue as normal. If you choose to say anything other than yes or no to the head caretaker, it is told that the children&amp;rsquo;s expressions will turn mortifying (Zalgonic, almost), and they will scream in inhuman voices: &amp;ldquo;Decide! DECIDE!&amp;rdquo; If you do anything besides say yes or no from here, it is told that the children and caretakers will slam the door on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you turn around, the story varies. Supposedly, your worst fear will be waiting at the other end of the hallway, separating you from your exit. Most notably, this character is Aka Manto or the Rake. The least you could do is greet the creature before he tears you unto oblivion. If he has the capacity, he may well respond, and you will die as a polite person. Don&amp;rsquo;t greet him, and you will end up as another one of the beheaded bodies along the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you respond, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand&amp;rdquo; (and you must be genuine), the head caretaker will say, &amp;ldquo;Go to your school, and watch your children play. You should understand then.&amp;rdquo; Nothing will have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close the door on your way out. It&amp;rsquo;s common courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Snuff Film</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course nobody believes in snuff films. They&amp;rsquo;re just too sick to be real, right? Nobody in their right mind would actively produce evidence against themselves like that, let alone make money off of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Goldstein, publisher of Screw magazine, has a standing offer of one million American dollars for anyone who can find a real, commercially sold snuff movie. The offer has been in place for years and nobody has claimed it. And for good reason. I mean, you don&amp;rsquo;t buy a carton of cigarettes and then sell it for half or a third of the price, do you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, as far as I know, nobody has ever taken one of these films home, seeing as they aren&amp;rsquo;t sold, as everybody thinks. That&amp;rsquo;s too much of a risk. You pay to view a screening of it. Nobody besides the people who make money off of them has ever held a copy of these films. As far as I know, there are only three, all male. Actually, the only females involved in these movies are the victims. Not all movies contain rape or sex of any kind, but it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon, especially in the few starring children as victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all may sound a bit odd to a lot of you, but that makes sense; this type of thing just can&amp;rsquo;t exist, right? It is, though, very hard to get to attend one of these screenings. You need to be invited, and everyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever been invited has been done so by personal mail, i.e. not via the postal office. The letters are apparently drenched in some chemical that makes the paper dissolve after a certain amount of time outside the envelope, possibly in contact with air or light&amp;mdash;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I know is that these people are clever and they take their measures. If they knew who I am, they&amp;rsquo;d surely kill me, maybe even make me into a movie star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;rsquo;d be shown into their little cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite a dark place, seeing as the only lights are candles situated around the screening room. The entrance to the snuff theater is that of a decrepit, old factory, reminiscent of a slaughterhouse. The letter would have short instructions on how to get to the screening room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projector itself, apparently hooked to a recently bought DVD-player, is powered by a car battery. I&amp;rsquo;ve been told they used to use a small gas engine back in the 30s. The &amp;lsquo;chairs&amp;rsquo; are the same old tables that were once used as slaughter benches. As soon as the screening is over, all the guests (a maximum of ten or so) are threatened to leave immediately through three different exits with thirty minutes intervals. The exits are different from the entrance, as they lead to underground tunnels, probably old sewers, that take you to back alleys in different parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew, i.e. the people with the films, quickly vanish, probably through a fourth exit. If you manage to find the screening room after a screening, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know it was ever used for anything like that. It just looks like a walk-in-freezer with white walls, meat hooks still in the ceiling, and tables with obvious marks of old, dried blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about a hundred and twenty snuff films that can be viewed in just this one cinema, and there are probably more throughout the world. Each film is categorized by victim, method of killing, sexual content, &amp;ldquo;level of brutality&amp;rdquo;, and whether it takes place pre or postmortem. At least one film consists of several young, blonde women being choked to death while performing an unwilling blowjob. Another is of a young child being cut open while drugged just enough to paralyze his body, but still keep him audibly and visibly awake. Yet another is of a man hung upside down on a meat hook, whose testicles are removed with a machete and force-fed to him before he dies from blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on about these movies, as I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a good portion of them. Why not? I have the money for it. The goriest film I&amp;rsquo;ve seen was that of a middle aged, dark-haired woman having her hands, feet, arms and legs amputated while drugged, then sewn them crudely back on at the wrong extremities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next cut showed her wriggle in terror as she tried standing up on her arm-feet until she collapsed and vomited. A door behind her opened and a male figure swung an aluminum baseball bat at her head. On impact, her head bent, and she let out a gurgling cry before going limp and silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angle of the camera changed, and the man hit her head again, this time bursting it open, spilling brain matter debris. A crying child was then shown eating her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the most satisfying movie I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;float-right&#34;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;picture&gt;
&lt;a title=&#34;Click to enlarge the image.&#34; href=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/mr-mix/mr-mix-by-felixlyons-d4ux8pb.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://qualitypasta.net/creepypasta/mr-mix/mr-mix-by-felixlyons-d4ux8pb.png&#34;  alt=&#34;An artist&amp;rsquo;s rendition of their nightmare of Mr. Mix.&#34;   title=&#34;An artist&amp;#39;s rendition of their nightmare of Mr. Mix.&#34;  loading=&#34;lazy&#34; decoding=&#34;async&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;An artist&amp;rsquo;s rendition of their nightmare of Mr. Mix.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone remember an old PC game from the early 1990s called &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr. Mix&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/em&gt; It was mainly a typing game, similar to Mario Teaches Typing, where you have to put words into a box to make a chef (the titular Mr. Mix) place ingredients into a bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most typing games, however, the game was notorious for having an insane difficulty curve. It had a &amp;ldquo;Words per Minute&amp;rdquo; requirement for each level, being as low as 10 on level one and as high as 85 on the third. By level five, the requirement reaches over 500, effectively making it impossible to proceed any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main things that people immediately noticed about the game was the background music. On the first level, it was an unsettling pattern of growls that got progressively louder as the level went on, often causing damage to early computer speakers that were not designed to handle extremely high volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second level had no music at all, and the third had what sounded like a very low-quality recording of a hair dryer playing in the background. The remaining two levels had an incredibly loud high-pitched ringing throughout that caused severe eardrum damage to those who managed to get that far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another rather disturbing aspect of the game was the design of Mr. Mix himself. He was a large, round-faced, overweight man with beady eyes and red spots on his cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most children who played the game reported having vivid nightmares of Mr. Mix speaking to them in a quiet, raspy voice and threatening them to keep quiet about something. However, none of them could remember exactly what that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One psychologist who saw many of these children reported being disturbed by the sheer amount of terror on their faces as they recounted details of the nightmare. Many of them broke down into tears in the process, begging for their parents to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; them. However, no direct relationship to the game itself could be determined by these few cases, as not all children suffered the same adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons, the game did not sell very well. It remained in relative obscurity until a few years ago, when PC hackers got hold of a ROM of it and started digging through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using memory hacking software, they managed to crack the game&amp;rsquo;s code and bypass the impossible fifth level. What they found, however, was highly disturbing, and caused many of them to quit the expedition altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the reports these hackers left behind, the game behaves very strangely if the fifth level is bypassed. The game crashes violently and closes, writing a bunch of files to the user&amp;rsquo;s System32 directory to the point that the RAM is almost completely filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These files are reportedly pictures of people with horribly deformed faces appearing to scream in pain and agony, their eyes bleeding from their tear ducts and their outer layer of skin torn clean off in multiple places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user attempts to delete these files, their computer will violently crash and blue screen, causing permanent, irreparable damage to the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers found that this was caused by a lone byte in the game&amp;rsquo;s ROM that triggered when the fifth level was completed. After removing this byte, they were able to proceed to the sixth and final level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all of the original hackers declined to discuss what they saw in the final level. Each of them became extremely paranoid and reclusive afterwards, refusing to talk about anything related to the game and showing astonishingly extreme symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them ceased to be able to form coherent sentences within a week. Within a month, all of them had gone missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All remaining copies of the game were destroyed. To this day, no one knows what was in it that caused the group so much psychological damage. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s better that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years after this incident, a man was arrested for trying to kidnap an eight-year old girl from a grocery store. Through DNA and fingerprint analysis, he was identified as one of the original hackers who had viewed the final level of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was wearing a white chef&amp;rsquo;s hat and had a look of unspeakable malice and insanity on his face. When interrogated, the man would only say one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Mr. Mix. Shhh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<title>Pale Luna</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade and a half, it&amp;rsquo;s become infinitely easier to obtain exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for by way of a couple of keystrokes. The Internet has made it all too simple to use a computer to change reality. An abundance of information is merely a search engine away, to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine life as any different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, a generation ago, when the words &amp;lsquo;streaming&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;torrent&amp;rsquo; were meaningless save for conversations about water, people met face-to-face to conduct software swap parties, trading games and applications on Sharpie-labeled, five-and-a-quarter inch floppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, most of the time, the meets were a way for frugal, community-minded individuals to trade popular games like King&amp;rsquo;s Quest and Maniac Mansion amongst themselves. However, a few early programming talents designed their own computer games to share amongst their circle of acquaintances, who in turn would pass them on, until, if fun and well-designed enough, an independently-developed game had its place in the collection of aficionados across the country. Think of it as the 80s equivalent of a viral video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pale Luna, on the other hand, was never circulated outside of the San Francisco Bay Area. All known copies have long been disposed of, all computers that have ever run the game now detritus buried under layers of filth and polystyrene. This fact is attributed to a number of rather abstruse design choices made by its programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pale Luna was a text adventure in the vein of &lt;em&gt;Zork and The Lurking Horror&lt;/em&gt;, at a time when said genre was swiftly going out of fashion. Upon booting up the program, the player was presented with an almost completely blank screen, except for the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You are in a dark room. Moonlight shines through the window.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;There is GOLD in the corner, along with a SHOVEL and a ROPE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;There is a DOOR to the EAST.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Command?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So began the game that one writer for a long-out-of-print fanzine decried as &amp;ldquo;enigmatic, nonsensical, and completely unplayable&amp;rdquo;. As the only commands that the game would accept were PICK UP GOLD, PICK UP SHOVEL, PICK UP ROPE, OPEN DOOR, and GO EAST, the player was soon presented with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Reap your reward.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PALE LUNA SMILES AT YOU.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You are in a forest. There are paths to the NORTH, WEST, and EAST.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Command?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What quickly infuriated the few who&amp;rsquo;ve played the game was the confusing and buggy nature of the second screen onward&amp;mdash;only one of the directional decisions would be the correct one. For example, on this occasion, a command to go in a direction other than NORTH would lead to the system freezing, requiring the operator to hard reboot the entire computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What quickly infuriated the few who&amp;rsquo;ve played the game was the confusing and buggy nature of the second screen onward&amp;mdash;only one of the directional decisions would be the correct one. For example, on this occasion, a command to go in a direction other than NORTH would lead to the system freezing, requiring the operator to hard reboot the entire computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Not here.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USE SHOVEL, which brought up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Not now.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And USE ROPE, which prompted the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You&#39;ve already used this.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most who played the game progressed a couple of screens into it before becoming fed-up of having to constantly reboot their devices and tossing the disk in disgust, writing off the experience as a shoddily programmed farce. However, there is one thing about the world of computers that remains true, no matter the era: some people who use them have way too much time on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young man by the name of Michael Nevins decided to see if there was more to Pale Luna than what met the eye. Five hours and thirty-three screens worth of trial-and-error and unplugged computer cords later, he finally managed to make the game display different text. The text in this new area read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;There are no paths.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The ground is soft.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PALE LUNA SMILES WIDE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Here.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Command?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another hour still before Nevins stumbled upon the proper combination of phrases to make the game progress any further: DIG HOLE, DROP GOLD, then FILL HOLE. This caused the screen to display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--- 40.24248 ---&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--- -121.4434 ---&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon which the game ceased to accept commands, requiring the user to reboot one last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some deliberation, Nevins came to the conclusion that the numbers referred to lines of latitude and longitude. The coordinates lead to a point in the sprawling forest that dominated the nearby Lassen Volcanic Park. As he possessed much more free time than sense, Nevins vowed to see Pale Luna through to its ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, armed with a map, a compass, and a shovel, he navigated the park&amp;rsquo;s trails, noting with amusement how each turn he made corresponded roughly to those that he took in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he initially regretted bringing the cumbersome digging tool on a mere hunch, the path&amp;rsquo;s similarity all but confirmed his suspicions that the journey would end with him face-to-face with an eccentric&amp;rsquo;s buried treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of breath after a tricky struggle to the coordinates, he was pleasantly surprised by a literal stumble upon a patch of uneven dirt. Shoveling as excitedly as he was, it would be an understatement to say that he was taken aback when his heavy strokes unearthed the badly-decomposing head of a blonde-haired little girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevins promptly reported the situation to the authorities. The girl was identified as Karen Paulsen, 11, reported as missing to the San Diego Police Department a year and a half prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts were made to track down the programmer of Pale Luna, but the nearly-anonymous legal gray area in which the software swapping community operated inescapably led to many dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectors have been known to offer upwards of six figures for an authentic copy of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of Karen&amp;rsquo;s body was never found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that Peter Terry was addicted to heroin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were friends in college and continued to be after I graduated. Notice that I said &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo;. He dropped out after two years of barely cutting it. After I moved out of the dorms and into a small apartment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see Peter as much. We would talk online every now and then (AIM was king in pre-Facebook years). There was a period where he wasn&amp;rsquo;t online for about five weeks straight. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t worried. He was a pretty notorious flake and drug addict, so I assumed he just stopped caring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one night, I saw him log on. Before I could initiate a conversation, he sent me a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David, man, we need to talk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was when he told me about the &lt;strong&gt;NoEnd House&lt;/strong&gt;. It got that name because no one had ever reached the final exit. The rules were pretty simple and cliche: reach the final room of the building and you win $500. There were nine rooms in all. The house was located outside the city, roughly four miles from my house. Apparently, Peter had tried and failed. He was a heroin and who-knows-what-the-fuck addict, so I figured the drugs got the best of him and he wigged out at a paper ghost or something. He told me it would be too much for anyone. That it was unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe him. I told him I would check it out the next night, and no matter how hard he tried to convince me otherwise, $500 sounded too good to be true. I had to go. I set out the following night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, I immediately noticed something strange about the building. Have you ever seen or read something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be scary, but for some reason, a chill crawls up your spine? I walked toward the building and the feeling of uneasiness only intensified as I opened the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart slowed and I let a relieved sigh leave me as I entered. The room looked like a normal hotel lobby decorated for Halloween. A sign was posted in place of a worker. It read, &amp;ldquo;Room 1 this way. Eight more follow. Reach the end and you win!&amp;rdquo; I chuckled and made my way to the first door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first area was almost laughable. The decor resembled the Halloween aisle of a K-Mart, complete with sheet ghosts and animatronic zombies that gave a static growl when you passed by. At the far end was an exit; it was the only door besides the one I entered through. I brushed through the fake spider webs and headed for the second room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was greeted by fog as I opened the door to room two. The room definitely upped the ante in terms of technology. Not only was there a fog machine, but a bat hung from the ceiling and flew in a circle. Scary. They seemed to have a Halloween soundtrack that one would find in a 99 cent store on loop somewhere in the room. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a stereo, but I guessed they must have used a PA system. I stepped over a few toy rats that wheeled around and walked with a puffed chest across to the next area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached for the doorknob and my heart sank to my knees. I did not want to open that door. A feeling of dread hit me so hard I could barely even think. Logic overtook me after a few terrified moments, and I shook it off and entered the next room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room three is when things began to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, it looked like a normal room. There was a chair in the middle of the wood paneled floor. A single lamp in the corner did a poor job of lighting the area, casting a few shadows across the floor and walls. That was the problem. Shadows. Plural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of the chair&amp;rsquo;s, there were others. I had barely walked in the door and I was already terrified. It was at that moment that I knew something wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even think as I automatically tried to open the door I came through. It was locked from the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That set me off. Was someone locking the doors as I progressed? There was no way. I would have heard them. Was it a mechanical lock that set automatically? Maybe. But I was too scared to really think. I turned back to the room and the shadows were gone. The chair&amp;rsquo;s shadow remained, but the others were gone. I slowly began to walk. I used to hallucinate when I was a kid, so I wrote off the shadows as a figment of my imagination. I began to feel better as I made it to the halfway point of the room. I looked down as I took my steps and that&amp;rsquo;s when I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or didn&amp;rsquo;t see it. My shadow wasn&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to scream. I ran as fast as I could to the other door and flung myself without thinking into the room beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth room was possibly the most disturbing. As I closed the door, all light seemed to be sucked out and put back into the previous room. I stood there, surrounded by darkness, not able to move. I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid of the dark and never have been, but I was absolutely terrified. All sight had left me. I held my hand in front of my face and if I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was doing, I would never have been able to tell. Darkness doesn&amp;rsquo;t describe it. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything. It was dead silence. When you&amp;rsquo;re in a sound-proof room, you can still hear yourself breathing. You can hear yourself being alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to stumble forward after a few moments, my rapidly beating heart the only thing I could feel. There was no door in sight. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure there was one this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silence was then broken by a low hum. I felt something behind me. I spun around wildly but could barely even see my nose. I knew it was there, though. Regardless of how dark it was, I knew something was there. The hum grew louder, closer. It seemed to surround me, but I knew whatever was causing the noise was in front of me, inching closer. I took a step back; I had never felt that kind of fear. I can&amp;rsquo;t really describe true fear. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even scared I was going to die; I was scared of what the alternative was. I was afraid of what this thing had in store for me. Then the lights flashed for a second and I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. I saw nothing and I know I saw nothing there. The room was again plunged into darkness and the hum became a wild screech. I screamed in protest; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear this goddamn sound for another minute. I ran backwards, away from the noise, and fumbled for the door handle. I turned and fell into room five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I describe room five, you have to understand something. I am not a drug addict. I have had no history of drug abuse or any sort of psychosis short of the childhood hallucinations I mentioned earlier, and those were only when I was really tired or just waking up. I entered the NoEnd House with a clear head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After falling in from the previous room, my view of room five was from my back, looking up at the ceiling. What I saw didn&amp;rsquo;t scare me; it simply surprised me. Trees had grown into the room and towered above my head. The ceilings in this room were taller than the others, which made me think I was in the center of the house. I got up off the floor, dusted myself off, and took a look around. It was definitely the biggest room of them all. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even see the door from where I was; various brush and trees must have blocked my line of sight with the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, I figured the rooms were going to get scarier, but this was a paradise compared to the last room. I also assumed whatever was in room four stayed back there. I was incredibly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I made my way deeper into the room, I began to hear what one would hear if they were in a forest; chirping bugs and the occasional flap of birds seemed to be my only company. That was the thing that bothered me the most. I heard the bugs and other animals, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any of them. I began to wonder how big this house was. From the outside when I first walked up to it, it looked like a regular house. It was definitely on the bigger side, but there was almost an entire forest in here. The canopy covered my view of the ceiling, but I assumed it was still there, however high it was. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any walls, either. The only way I knew I was still inside was that the floor matched the other rooms, with standard dark wood paneling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept walking, hoping that the next tree I passed would reveal the door. After a few moments of walking, I felt a mosquito fly onto my arm. I shook it off and kept going. A second later, I felt about ten more land all over my skin. I felt them crawl up and down my arms and legs and a few made their way across my face. I flailed wildly to get them all off, but they just kept crawling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked down and let out a muffled scream - more of a whimper, to be honest. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a single bug. Not one bug was on me, but I could feel them crawl. I heard them fly by my face and sting my skin, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see a single one. I dropped to the ground and began to roll wildly. I was desperate. I hated bugs, especially ones I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see or touch. But these bugs could touch me and they were everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to crawl. I had no idea where I was going; the entrance was nowhere in sight and I still hadn&amp;rsquo;t even seen the exit. So I just crawled, my skin wriggling with the presence of those phantom bugs. After what seemed like hours, I found the door. I grabbed the nearest tree and propped myself up, mindlessly slapping my arms and legs to no avail. I tried to run, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t; my body was exhausted from crawling and dealing with whatever it was that was on me. I took a few shaky steps to the door, grabbing each tree on the way for support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only a few feet away when I heard it. The low hum from before. It was coming from the next room and it was deeper. I could almost feel it inside my body, like when you stand next to an amp at a concert. The feeling of the bugs on me lessened as the hum grew louder. As I placed my hand on the doorknob, the bugs were completely gone, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to turn the knob. I knew that if I let go, the bugs would return and there was no way I would make it back to room four. I just stood there, my head pressed against the door marked six and my hand shakily grasping the knob. The hum was so loud I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even hear myself pretend to think. There was nothing I could do but move on. Room six was next, and room six was Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I closed the door behind me, my eyes held shut and my ears ringing. The hum was surrounding me. As the door clicked into place, the hum was gone. I opened my eyes in surprise and the door I had shut was gone. It was just a wall now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around in shock. The room was identical to room three - the same chair and lamp - but with the correct amount of shadows this time. The only real difference was that there was no exit door and the one I came in through was gone. As I said before, I had no previous issues in terms of mental instability, but at that moment, I fell into what I now know was insanity. I didn&amp;rsquo;t scream. I didn&amp;rsquo;t make a sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I scratched softly. The wall was tough, but I knew the door was there somewhere. I just knew it was. I scratched at where the doorknob was. I clawed at the wall frantically with both hands, my nails being filed down to the skin against the wood. I fell silently to my knees, the only sound in the room the incessant scratching against the wall. I knew it was there. The door was there, I knew it was just there. I knew if I could just get past this wall -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you alright?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jumped off the ground and spun in one motion. I leaned against the wall behind me and I saw what it was that spoke to me; to this day I regret ever turning around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a little girl. She was wearing a soft, white dress that went down to her ankles. She had long blonde hair to the middle of her back and white skin and blue eyes. She was the most frightening thing I had ever seen, and I know that nothing in my life will ever be as unnerving as what I saw in her. While looking at her, I saw something else. Where she stood I saw what looked like a man&amp;rsquo;s body, only larger than normal and covered in hair. He was naked from head to toe, but his head was not human and his toes were hooves. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the Devil, but at that moment, it might as well have been. The form had the head of a ram and the snout of a wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was horrifying and it was synonymous with the little girl in front of me. They were the same form. I can&amp;rsquo;t really describe it, but I saw them at the same time. They shared the same spot in that room, but it was like looking at two separate dimensions. When I saw the girl, I saw the form, and when I saw the form, I saw the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak. I could barely even see. My mind was revolting against what it was attempting to process. I had been scared before in my life and I had never been more scared than when I was trapped in the fourth room, but that was before room six. I just stood there, staring at whatever it was that spoke to me. There was no exit. I was trapped here with it. And then it spoke again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David, you should have listened.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it spoke, I heard the words of the little girl, but the other form spoke through my mind in a voice I won&amp;rsquo;t attempt to describe. There was no other sound. The voice just kept repeating that sentence over and over in my mind and I agreed. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. I was slipping into madness, yet couldn&amp;rsquo;t take my eyes off what was in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped to the floor. I thought I had passed out, but the room wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me. I just wanted it to end. I was on my side, my eyes wide open and the form staring down at me. Scurrying across the floor in front of me was one of the battery-powered rats from the second room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house was toying with me. For some reason, seeing that rat pulled my mind back from whatever depths it was headed. I looked around the room. I was getting out of there. I was determined to escape the house and live and never think about this place again. I knew this room was Hell and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to take up a residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it was just my eyes that moved. I searched the walls for any kind of opening. The room wasn&amp;rsquo;t that big, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to soak up the entire layout. The demon still taunted me, the voice growing louder as the form stayed rooted where it stood. I placed my hand on the floor, lifted myself up to all four and turned to scan the wall behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw something I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe. The form was now right at my back, whispering into my mind about how I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have come. I felt its breath on the back of my neck, but I refused to turn around. A large rectangle was scratched into the wood, with a small dent chipped away in the center of it. Right in front of my eyes, I saw the large seven I had mindlessly etched into the wall. I knew what it was: room seven was just beyond that wall where room five was moments ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I had done it - maybe it was just my state of mind at the time - but I had created the door. I knew I had. In my madness, I had scratched into the wall what I needed the most: an exit to the next room. Room seven was close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew the demon was right behind me, but for some reason, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t touch me. I closed my eyes and placed both hands on the large seven in front of me. I pushed. I pushed as hard as I could. The demon was now screaming in my ear. It told me I was never leaving. It told me that this was the end but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to die; I was going to live there in room six with it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I pushed and screamed at the top of my lungs. I knew I was going to push through the wall eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clenched my eyes shut and screamed, and the demon was gone. I was left in silence. I turned around slowly and was greeted by the room as it was when I entered: just a chair and a lamp. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to waste. I turned back to the seven and jumped back slightly. What I saw was a door. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the one I had scratched in, but a regular door with a large seven on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My whole body was shaking. It took me a while to turn the knob. I just stood there for a while, staring at the door. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stay in room six. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. But if this was only room six, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine was seven had in store. I must have stood there for an hour, just staring at the seven. Finally, with a deep breath, I twisted the knob and opened the door to room seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled through the door, mentally exhausted and physically weak. The door behind me closed and I realized where I was. I was outside. Not outside like room five, but actually outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes stung. I wanted to cry. I fell to my knees and tried but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. I was finally out of that hell. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even care about the prize that was promised. I turned and saw that the door I just went through was the entrance. I walked to my car and drove home, thinking of how nice a shower sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I pulled up to my house, I felt uneasy. The joy of leaving NoEnd House had faded, and dread was slowly building in my stomach. I shook it off as residual from the house and made my way to the front door. I entered and immediately went up to my room. There on my bed was my cat, Baskerville. He was the first living thing I had seen all night and I reached to pet him. He hissed and swiped at my hand. I recoiled in shock, as he had never acted like that. I thought, &amp;ldquo;Whatever, he&amp;rsquo;s an old cat.&amp;rdquo; I jumped in the shower and got ready for what I was expecting to be a sleepless night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my shower, I went to the kitchen to make something to eat. I descended the stairs and turned into the family room; what I saw would be forever burned into my mind, however. My parents were lying on the ground, naked and covered in blood. They had been mutilated to near-unidentifiable states. Their limbs had been removed and placed next to their bodies, and their heads sat on their chests, facing me. The most unsettling part was their expressions. They were smiling, as though they were happy to see me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vomited and sobbed there in the family room. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what had happened; they didn&amp;rsquo;t even live with me at the time. I was a mess. Then I saw it: a door that was never there before. A door with a large eight scrawled on it in blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still in the house. I was standing in my family room but I was in room seven. The faces of my parents smiled wider as I realized this. They weren&amp;rsquo;t my parents; they couldn&amp;rsquo;t be, but they looked exactly like them. The door marked eight was across the room, behind the mutilated bodies in front of me. I knew I had to move on, but at that moment, I gave up. The smiling faces tore into my mind; they grounded me where I stood. I vomited again and nearly collapsed. Then the hum returned. It was louder than ever and it filled the house and shook the walls. The hum compelled me forwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to move slowly, making my way closer to the door and the bodies. I could barely stand, let alone walk, and the closer I got to my parents, the closer I came to suicide. The walls were now shaking so hard it seemed as though they were going to crumble, but still, the faces smiled at me. As I inched closer, their eyes followed me. I was now between the two bodies, a few feet away from the door. The dismembered hands clawed their way across the carpet towards me, all while the faces continued to stare. New terror washed over me and I walked faster. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hear them speak. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the voices to match those of my parents. They began to open their mouths and the hands were inches from my feet. In a dash of desperation, I lunged toward the door, threw it open, and slammed it behind me. Room eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was done. After what I had just experienced, I knew there wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything else this fucking house could throw at me that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live through. There was nothing short of the fires of Hell that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for. Unfortunately, I underestimated the abilities of NoEnd House. Unfortunately, things got more disturbing, more terrifying, and more unspeakable in room eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have trouble believing what I saw in room eight. Again, the room was a carbon copy of rooms three and six, but sitting in the usually empty chair was a man. After a few seconds of disbelief, my mind finally accepted the fact that the man sitting in the chair was me. Not someone who looked like me; it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; David Williams. I walked closer. I had to get a better look, even though I was sure of it. He looked up at me and I noticed tears in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please&amp;hellip; please, don&amp;rsquo;t do it. Please, don&amp;rsquo;t hurt me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; I asked. &amp;ldquo;Who are you? I&amp;rsquo;m not going to hurt you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes you are&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; He was sobbing now. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me and I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to.&amp;rdquo; He sat in the chair with his legs up and began rocking back and forth. It was actually pretty pathetic looking, especially since he was me, identical in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Listen, who are you?&amp;rdquo; I was now only a few feet from my doppelgänger. It was the weirdest experience yet, standing there talking to myself. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t scared, but I would be soon. &amp;ldquo;Why are you-&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me, you&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me, if you want to leave, you&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why are you saying this? Just calm down, alright? Let&amp;rsquo;s try and figure this-&amp;rdquo; And then I saw it. The David sitting down was wearing the same clothes as me, except for a small red patch on his shirt embroidered with the number nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me, you&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me, don&amp;rsquo;t, please, you&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes didn&amp;rsquo;t leave that small number on his chest. I knew exactly what it was. The first few doors were plain and simple, but after a while, they got a little more ambiguous. Seven was scratched into the wall, but by my own hands. Eight was marked in blood above the bodies of my parents. But nine - this number was on a person, a living person. Worse still, it was on a person that looked exactly like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David?&amp;rdquo; I had to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;hellip; you&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me, you&amp;rsquo;re going to hurt me&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; He continued to sob and rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He answered to David. He was me, right down to the voice. But that nine. I paced around for a few minutes while he sobbed in his chair. The room had no door and, similarly to room six, the door I came through was gone. For some reason, I assumed that scratching would get me nowhere this time. I studied the walls and floor around the chair, sticking my head underneath and seeing if anything was below. Unfortunately, there was. Below the chair was a knife. Attached was a tag that read, &amp;ldquo;To David - From Management.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling in my stomach as I read that tag was something sinister. I felt like throwing up. The last thing I wanted to do was remove that knife from under that chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other David was still sobbing uncontrollably. My mind was spinning into an attic of unanswerable questions. Who put this here and how did they get my name? Not to mention the fact that as I knelt on the cold wood floor, I also sat in that chair, sobbing in protest of being hurt by myself. It was all too much to process. The house and the management had been playing with me this whole time. My thoughts, for some reason, turned to Peter and whether or not he got this far. If he did, if he met a Peter Terry sobbing in this very chair, rocking back and forth&amp;hellip; I shook those thoughts out of my head; they didn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I took the knife from under the chair, and immediately, the other David went quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;David,&amp;rdquo; he said in my voice, &amp;ldquo;What do you think you&amp;rsquo;re going to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lifted myself from the ground and clenched the knife in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get out of here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David was still sitting in the chair, though he was very calm now. He looked up at me with a slight grin. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell if he was going to laugh or strangle me. Slowly, he got up from the chair and stood, facing me. It was uncanny. His height and even the way he stood matched mine. I felt the rubber hilt of the knife in my hand and gripped it tighter. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I was planning on doing with it, but I had a feeling I was going to need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now,&amp;rdquo; his voice was slightly deeper than my own. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to hurt you. I&amp;rsquo;m going to hurt you and I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep you here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t respond. I just lunged and tackled him to the ground. I mounted him and looked down, knife poised and ready. He looked up at me, terrified. It was like I was looking in a mirror. Then the hum returned, low and distant, though I still felt it deep in my body. David looked up at me as I looked down at myself. The hum was getting louder and I felt something inside me snap. With one motion, I slammed the knife into the patch on his chest and ripped down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackness fell on the room and I was falling. The darkness around me was like nothing I had experienced up to that point. Room four was dark, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t come close to what was completely engulfing me. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure if I was falling after a while. I felt weightless, covered in dark. Then a deep sadness came over me. I felt lost, depressed, and suicidal. The sight of my parents entered my mind. I knew it wasn&amp;rsquo;t real, but I had seen it, and the mind has trouble differentiating between what is real and what isn&amp;rsquo;t. The sadness only deepened. I was in room nine for what seemed like days. The final room. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what it was: the end. NoEnd House had an end and I had reached it. At that moment, I gave up. I knew I would be in that in-between state forever, accompanied by nothing but darkness. Not even the hum was there to keep me sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had lost all senses. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel myself. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything. Sight was completely useless here. I searched for a taste in my mouth and found nothing. I felt disembodied and completely lost. I knew where I was. This was Hell. Room nine was Hell. Then it happened. A light. One of those stereotypical lights at the end of the tunnel. I felt ground come up from below me and I was standing. After a moment or two of gathering my thoughts and senses, I slowly walked toward that light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I approached the light, it took form. It was a vertical slit down the side of an unmarked door. I slowly walked through the door and found myself back where I started: the lobby of NoEnd House. It was exactly how I left it: still empty, still decorated with childish Halloween decorations. After everything that had happened that night, I was still wary of where I was. After a few moments of normalcy, I looked around the place, trying to find anything different. On the desk was a plain white envelope with my name handwritten on it. Immensely curious, yet still cautious, I mustered up the courage to open the envelope. Inside was a letter, again handwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Williams,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congratulations! You have made it to the end of NoEnd House! Please accept this prize as a token of great achievement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours forever,
Management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the letter were five $100 bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop laughing. I laughed for what seemed like hours. I laughed as I walked out to my car and laughed as I drove home. I laughed as I pulled into my driveway. I laughed as I opened my front door to my house and as I saw the small ten etched into the wood.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>I Found a Digital Camera in the Woods</title>

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I drove to a nearby town. The place was surrounded by tall hills and mountains. You could have a very pleasant hike down any of the numerous trails there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was climbing one trail when I saw what looked like a silver box. When I approached it, I noticed it was a digital camera!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a 3.3 megapixel Powershot S20! Slightly scuffed, but otherwise fine. It rained the next day, so I was really lucky to get there when I did. When I got home, I saw that it had a 300 megabyte hard drive inside. This must be about a £250 value, folks; I pity the fool who dropped it so carelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just wanted to share the pictures it contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

		<title>Teddy</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister had a teddy bear, a scary teddy bear. I do not know why, but it creeped me out. It was just so disturbing to me. The thing had eyes that looked so real. It was as if it was made from a real bear, and its face was just blank and unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to get weird feelings about the bear when my sister first got it-—-she was only a baby at the time, and I was about four. We had a dog, you see, and he had a habit of eating things, so my mother always had to put it up on the small cabinet in the corner of the hallway upstairs. Every time I went up those stairs, I saw that creepy bear suddenly glare around the corner at me, as if it was watching me. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the weird part; it started to get really strange about five years later, at the age of six or seven. My sister had lost interest in the bear, so my mother just threw it in the old toy cupboard. The only problem was that the cupboard was in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was nine, old enough to stay on my own and go to bed without any assistance, I would get into bed every night and turn my lamp off. This is when it got scary. As I was getting some sleep, I suddenly remembered Mum putting that teddy in the cupboard. I slowly turned and looked across my room to see it through the glass. My heart suddenly stopped as I thought about the horrors the plush had caused me, but at the age of nine, I wanted to grow up and lose my fears, so I shook it off and put my head back on the pillow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got up to pull my sheets on a bit further, I noticed something that would scar me for life. There, sat at the end of my bedroom, was the teddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there staring at it for about a minute. My heart started beating normally again. When I needed to yawn, I closed my eyes. I opened them to see the teddy sitting closer to my bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was really freaked out. I started to move back to the wall, and looked around to see if there was any sign that anyone had come in. When I looked back to see the teddy on the end of my bed, I was so startled that I almost fainted from fear. When I blinked, it had gone. I looked around. To my relief, I saw no sign of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat my head back down on my pillow, hoping for some sleep. Then I opened my eyes. It was above my head, staring straight down. I screamed as it lunged down at me. I will never see a bear the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later, after years of horror, I burned it; I sat in enjoyment as the bear turned to smoking ashes in my fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lived my teenage life through adolescence; the only thing I could remember that was in any way similar to my bad experience was when I watched Trainspotting. That fucking baby scene shocked me so badly, but other than that, all was well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I turned nineteen, I was about to move into my new home. I had been given the keys to the house and was ready to set up my furniture. After hours of carrying, I carried the final box from the removal truck into the front door and shut the door behind me. I turned to go into the kitchen and put it on the table. I opened it to see a cabinet. I took it out, walked into my new living room and placed it in the corner, stared at it and thought to myself, &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember packing this cabinet.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t really care that much, as I had just moved into my new home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked back into the kitchen to grab my television and brought it into the living room when I saw it. The teddy&amp;hellip; it just sat there, staring at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ever find yourself in LA&amp;rsquo;s Old China town, head into the square. Go past the statue of Sun Yat-sen, past the hip-ultramod toy store called &amp;ldquo;Munky King&amp;rdquo; and look for an import store next to what used to be a wishing fountain. Go into this store and head all the way to the back, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a selection of weapons. Look for a weapon called a Jiujiebian, a sort of multi-sectioned whip. It MUST have exactly nine segments, no more, no less. This will be called the &amp;ldquo;chain of night&amp;rdquo;. As of now, there are 48 notches in its handle. It will cost you 29.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after that, go outside and wait till dark. As the moon rises, take a quarter from your pocket and cast it at the wishing well. As it lands, focus on that spot exactly and slowly chant under your breath, &amp;ldquo;By the circles of Lao-tzu, the void inside of matter, I call forth the spirit that lingers here!&amp;rdquo; This phrase is best said in the original Mandarin, but the spirit will understand a sincere supplicant regardless of language. A girl will step out of the bottom of the fountain, about nine years of age. She will ask you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where has my mother gone?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must respond with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She has long since gone from earth, but look to the sky, and see her there!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spirit is not that of a little girl, but of a bog-hag, cursed to obey this one command regardless of who says it. At this moment, you must attempt to strike the girl with your newly acquired Jiujiebian. She will then snarl and attempt to fight back. Should you win, all the money ever thrown into the fountain will await you. If you fail, all that the folks in Chinatown know is that a bloody Jiujiebian lies at the door of the import store with a notch in its handle. To date, there are forty-nine notches in the handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now apart of Matt Dymerski&amp;rsquo;s collection &lt;em&gt;Psychosis: Tales of Horror&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Psychosis-Tales-Horror-Matt-Dymerski-ebook/dp/B005DSU784/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; class=&#34;external&#34;&gt;available on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday&#34;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this down on paper and not on my computer. I guess
I&amp;rsquo;ve just noticed some odd things. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don’t trust the computer&amp;hellip; I
just&amp;hellip; need to organize my thoughts. I need to get down all the details somewhere
objective, somewhere I know that what I write can’t be deleted or&amp;hellip; changed&amp;hellip;
not that that&amp;rsquo;s happened. It’s just&amp;hellip; everything blurs together here, and the
fog of memory lends a strange cast to things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel cramped in this small apartment. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the problem.
I just had to go and choose the cheapest apartment, the only one in the basement.
The lack of windows down here makes day and night seem to slip by seamlessly.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t been out in a few days because I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this programming
project so intensively. I suppose I just wanted to get it done. Hours of sitting
and staring at a monitor can make anyone feel strange, I know, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think
that&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I first started to feel like something was odd. I can&amp;rsquo;t even
define what it is. Maybe I just haven&amp;rsquo;t talked to anyone in awhile. That&amp;rsquo;s the
first thing that crept up on me. Everyone I normally talk to online while I
program has been idle, or they&amp;rsquo;ve simply not logged on at all. My instant
messages go unanswered. The last e-mail I got from anybody was a friend saying
he&amp;rsquo;d talk to me when he got back from the store, and that was yesterday. I&amp;rsquo;d
call with my cell phone, but reception&amp;rsquo;s terrible down here. Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s it.
I just need to call someone. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that didn&amp;rsquo;t work so well. As the tingle of fear fades, I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a little
ridiculous for being scared at all. I looked in the mirror before I went out,
but I didn&amp;rsquo;t shave the two-day stubble I&amp;rsquo;ve grown. I figured I was just going
out for a quick cell phone call. I did change my shirt, though, because it was
lunchtime, and I guessed that I&amp;rsquo;d run into at least one person I knew. That didn&amp;rsquo;t
end up happening. I wish it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went out, I opened the door to my small apartment slowly. A small feeling
of apprehension had somehow already lodged itself in me, for some indefinable
reason. I chalked it up to having not spoken to anyone but myself for a day
or two. I peered down the dingy grey hallway, made dingier by the fact that it
was a basement hallway. On one end, a large metal door led to the building’s
furnace room. It was locked, of course. Two dreary soda machines stood by it;
I bought a soda from one the first day I moved in, but it had a two year old
expiration date. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure nobody knows those machines are even down here,
or my cheap landlady just doesn’t care to get them restocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I closed my door softly, and walked the other direction, taking care not to make
a sound. I have no idea why I chose to do that, but it was fun giving in to the
strange impulse not to break the droning hum of the soda machines, at least for
the moment. I got to the stairwell, and took the stairs up to the building’s
front door. I looked through the heavy door&amp;rsquo;s small square window, and received
quite the shock: it was definitely not lunchtime. City-gloom hung over the dark
street outside, and the traffic lights at the intersection in the distance blinked
yellow. Dim clouds, purple and black from the glow of the city, hung overhead.
Nothing moved, save the few sidewalk trees that shifted in the wind. I remember
shivering, though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t cold. Maybe it was the wind outside. I could vaguely
hear it through the heavy metal door, and I knew it was that unique kind of
late-night wind, the kind that was constant, cold, and quiet, save for the rhythmic
music it made as it passed through countless unseen tree leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided not to go outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I lifted my cell phone to the door&amp;rsquo;s little window, and checked the
signal meter. The bars filled up the meter, and I smiled. Time to hear someone
else’s voice, I remember thinking, relieved. It was such a strange thing, to be
afraid of nothing. I shook my head, laughing at myself silently. I hit speed-dial
for my best friend Amy&amp;rsquo;s number, and held the phone up to my ear. It rang
once&amp;hellip; but then it stopped. Nothing happened. I listened to silence for a good twenty
seconds, then hung up. I frowned, and looked at the signal meter again&amp;mdash;still
full. I went to dial her number again, but then my phone rang in my hand, startling
me. I put it up to my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello?&amp;rdquo; I asked, immediately fighting down a small shock at hearing the first
spoken voice in days, even if it was my own. I had gotten used to the droning
hum of the building&amp;rsquo;s inner workings, my computer, and the soda machines in the
hallway. There was no response to my greeting at first, but then, finally, a
voice came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey,&amp;rdquo; said a clear male voice, obviously of college age, like me. &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;John,&amp;rdquo; I replied, confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, sorry, wrong number,&amp;rdquo; he replied, then hung up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lowered the phone slowly and leaned against the thick brick wall of the
stairwell. That was strange. I looked at my received calls list, but the number
was unfamiliar. Before I could think on it further, the phone rang loudly,
shocking me yet again. This time, I looked at the caller before I answered. It
was another unfamiliar number. This time, I held the phone up to my ear, but
said nothing. I heard nothing but the general background noise of a phone.
Then, a familiar voice broke my tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;John?&amp;rdquo; was the single word, in Amy&amp;rsquo;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s you,&amp;rdquo; I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who else would it be?&amp;rdquo; she responded. &amp;ldquo;Oh, the number. I&amp;rsquo;m at a party on Seventh
Street, and my phone died just as you called me. This is someone else&amp;rsquo;s phone,
obviously.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, ok,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where are you?&amp;rdquo; she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes glanced over the drab white-washed cylinder block walls and the heavy
metal door with its small window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At my building,&amp;rdquo; I sighed. &amp;ldquo;Just feeling cooped up. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it was
so late.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You should come here,&amp;rdquo; she said, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nah, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like looking for some strange place by myself in the middle
of the night,&amp;rdquo; I said, looking out the window at the silent windy street that
secretly scared me just a tiny bit. &amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;m just going to keep working or
go to bed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nonsense!&amp;rdquo; she replied. &amp;ldquo;I can come get you! Your building is close to Seventh
Street, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How drunk are you?&amp;rdquo; I asked lightheartedly. &amp;ldquo;You know where I live.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, of course,&amp;rdquo; she said abruptly. &amp;ldquo;I guess I can&amp;rsquo;t get there by walking, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You could if you wanted to waste half an hour,&amp;rdquo; I told her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Right,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Ok, have to go, good luck with your work!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lowered the phone once more, looking at the numbers flash as the call ended.
Then, the droning silence suddenly reasserted itself in my ears. The two strange
calls and the eerie street outside just drove home my aloneness in this empty
stairwell. Perhaps from having seen too many scary movies, I had the sudden
inexplicable idea that something could look in the door&amp;rsquo;s window and see me,
some sort of horrible entity that hovered at the edge of aloneness, just waiting
to creep up on unsuspecting people that strayed too far from other human beings.
I knew the fear was irrational, but nobody else was around, so&amp;hellip; I jumped down the
stairs, ran down the hallway into my room, and closed the door as swiftly as I
could while still staying silent. Like I said, I feel a little ridiculous for
being scared of nothing, and the fear has already faded. Writing this down helps
a lot&amp;mdash;it makes me realize that nothing is wrong. It filters out half-formed
thoughts and fears and leaves only cold, hard facts. It’s late, I got a call
from a wrong number, and Amy&amp;rsquo;s phone died, so she called me back from another
number. Nothing strange is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there was something a little off about that conversation. I know it could
have just been the alcohol she&amp;rsquo;d had&amp;hellip; or was it even her that seemed off to me?
Or was it&amp;hellip; yes, that was it! I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it until this moment, writing these
things down. I knew writing things down would help. She said she was at a party,
but I only heard silence in the background! Of course, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything
in particular, as she could have just gone outside to make the call. No&amp;hellip; that
couldn&amp;rsquo;t be it either. I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear the wind! I need to see if the wind is still
blowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot to finish writing last night. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I expected to see when
I ran up the stairwell and looked out the heavy metal door&amp;rsquo;s window. I’m feeling
ridiculous. Last night&amp;rsquo;s fear seems hazy and unreasonable to me now. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait
to go out into the sunlight. I’m going to check my email, shave, shower, and
finally get out of here! Wait&amp;hellip; I think I heard something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was thunder. That whole sunlight and fresh air thing didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. I went out
into the stairwell and up the stairs, only to find disappointment. The heavy metal
door&amp;rsquo;s little window showed only flowing water, as torrential rain slammed against
it. Only a very dim, gloomy light filtered in through the rain, but at least I knew
it was daytime, even if it was a grey, sickly, wet day. I tried looking out the
window and waiting for lightning to illuminate the gloom, but the rain was too heavy
and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make out anything more than vague weird shapes moving at odd angles
in the waves washing down the window. Disappointed, I turned around, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t
want to go back to my room. Instead, I wandered further up the stairs, past the
first floor, and the second. The stairs ended at the third floor, the highest floor
in the building. I looked through the glass that ran up the outer wall of the
stairwell, but it was that warped, thick kind that scatters the light, not that
there was much to see through the rain to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened the stairwell door and wandered down the hallway. The ten or so thick wooden
doors, painted blue a long time ago, were all closed. I listened as I walked, but
it was the middle of the day, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised that I heard nothing but the
rain outside. As I stood there in the dim hallway, listening to the rain, I had
the strange fleeting impression that the doors were standing like silent granite
monoliths erected by some ancient forgotten civilization for some unfathomable
guardian purpose. Lightning flashed, and I could have sworn that, for just a
moment, the old grainy blue wood looked just like rough stone. I laughed at
myself for letting my imagination get the best of me, but then it occurred to
me that the dim gloom and lightning must mean there was a window somewhere in
the hallway. A vague memory surfaced, and I suddenly recalled that the third
floor had an alcove and an inset window halfway down the floor’s hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited to look out into the rain and possibly see another human being, I
quickly walked over to the alcove, finding the large thin glass window. Rain
washed down it, as with the front door&amp;rsquo;s window, but I could open this one. I
reached a hand out to slide it open, but hesitated. I had the strangest feeling
that if I opened that window, I would see something absolutely horrifying on the
other side. Everything’s been so odd lately&amp;hellip; so I came up with a plan, and I came
back here to get what I needed. I don’t seriously think anything will come of it,
but I&amp;rsquo;m bored, it&amp;rsquo;s raining, and I’m going stir crazy. I came back to get my webcam.
The cord isn&amp;rsquo;t long enough to reach the third floor by any means, so instead I&amp;rsquo;m
going to hide it between the two soda machines in the dark end of my basement
hallway, run the wire along the wall and under my door, and put black duct tape
over the wire to blend it in with the black plastic strip that runs along the base
of the hallway&amp;rsquo;s walls. I know this is silly, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything better
to do&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, nothing happened. I propped open the hallway-to-stairwell door, steeled
myself, then flung the heavy front door wide open and ran like hell down the
stairs to my room and slammed the door. I watched the webcam on my computer
intently, seeing the hallway outside my door and most of the stairwell. I’m
watching it right now, and I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything interesting. I just wish the
camera&amp;rsquo;s position was different, so that I could see out the front door.
Hey! Somebody&amp;rsquo;s online!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out an older, less functional webcam that I had in my closet to video chat
with my friend online. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really explain to him why I wanted to video chat,
but it felt good to see another person’s face. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t talk very long, and we
didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about anything meaningful, but I feel much better. My strange fear has
almost passed. I would feel completely better, but there was something&amp;hellip; odd&amp;hellip; about
our conversation. I know that I&amp;rsquo;ve said that everything has seemed odd, but&amp;hellip; still,
he was very vague in his responses. I can&amp;rsquo;t recall one specific thing that he
said&amp;hellip; no particular name, or place, or event&amp;hellip; but he did ask for my email address
to keep in touch. Wait, I just got an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m about to go out. I just got an email from Amy that asked me to meet her for
dinner at &amp;rsquo;the place we usually go to.&amp;rsquo; I do love pizza, and I&amp;rsquo;ve just been eating
random food from my poorly stocked fridge for days, so I can&amp;rsquo;t wait. Again, I feel
ridiculous about the odd couple of days I&amp;rsquo;ve been having. I should destroy this
journal when I get back. Oh, another email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my god. I almost left the email and opened the door. I almost opened the
door. I almost opened the door, but I read the email first! It was from a
friend I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard from in a long time, and it was sent to a huge number
of emails that must have been every person he had saved in his address list.
It had no subject, and it said, simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;seen with your own eyes don’t trust them they&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the hell is that supposed to mean? The words shock me, and I keep going
over and over them. Is it a desperate email sent just as&amp;hellip; something happened?
The words are obviously cut off without finishing! On any other day I would
have dismissed this as spam from a computer virus or something, but the
words&amp;hellip; seen with your own eyes! I can’t help but read over this journal
and think back on the last few days and realize that I have not seen another
person with my own eyes or talked to another person face to face. The webcam
conversation with my friend was so strange, so vague, so&amp;hellip; eerie, now that I
think about it. Was it eerie? Or is the fear clouding my memory? My mind toys
with the progression of events I&amp;rsquo;ve written here, pointing out that I have not
been presented with one single fact that I did not specifically give out
unsuspectingly. The random &amp;lsquo;wrong number&amp;rsquo; that got my name and the subsequent
strange return call from Amy, the friend that asked for my email address&amp;hellip; I
messaged him first when I saw him online! And then I got my first email a
few minutes after that conversation! Oh my god! That phone call with Amy!
I said over the phone&amp;mdash;I said that I was within half an hour&amp;rsquo;s walk of
Seventh Street! They know I’m near there! What if they&amp;rsquo;re trying to find me?!
Where is everyone else? Why haven’t I seen or heard anyone else in days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, this is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. I need to calm down.
This madness needs to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to think. I ran about my apartment furiously, holding my
cell phone up to every corner to see if it got a signal through the heavy
walls. Finally, in the tiny bathroom, near one ceiling corner, I got a single
bar. Holding my phone there, I sent a text message to every number in my list.
Not wanting to betray anything about my unfounded fears, I simply sent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You seen anyone face to face lately?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I just wanted any reply back. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care what the reply was,
or if I embarrassed myself. I tried to call someone a few times, but I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t get my head up high enough, and if I brought my cell phone down
even an inch, it lost signal. Then I remembered the computer, and rushed over
to it, instant messaging everyone online. Most were idle or away from their
computer. Nobody responded. My messages grew more frantic, and I started
telling people where I was and to stop by in person for a host of barely
passable reasons. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care about anything by that point. I just needed
to see another person!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tore apart my apartment looking for something that I might have missed;
some way to contact another human being without opening the door. I know it&amp;rsquo;s
crazy, I know it’s unfounded, but what if? WHAT IF? I just need to be sure!
I taped the phone to the ceiling in case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE PHONE RANG! Exhausted from last night&amp;rsquo;s rampage, I must have fallen asleep.
I woke up to the phone ringing, and ran into the bathroom, stood on the toilet,
and flipped open the phone taped to the ceiling. It was Amy, and I feel so much
better. She was really worried about me, and apparently had been trying to
contact me since the last time I talked to her. She&amp;rsquo;s coming over now, and,
yes, she knows where I am without me telling her. I feel so embarrassed. I am
definitely throwing this journal away before anyone sees it. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know
why I&amp;rsquo;m writing in it now. Maybe it’s just because it’s the only communication
I&amp;rsquo;ve had at all since&amp;hellip; god knows when. I look like hell, too. I looked in the
mirror before I came back in here. My eyes are sunken, my stubble is thicker,
and I just look generally unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apartment is trashed, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to clean it up. I think I need
someone else to see what I&amp;rsquo;ve been through. These past few days have NOT been
normal. I am not one to imagine things. I know I have been the victim of
extreme probability. I probably missed seeing another person a dozen times.
I just happened to go out when it was late at night, or the middle of the day
when everyone was gone. Everything&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine, I know this now. Plus, I
found something in the closet last night that has helped me tremendously: a
television! I set it up just before I wrote this, and it’s on in the
background. Television has always been an escape for me, and it reminds me
that there&amp;rsquo;s a world beyond these dingy brick walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad Amy’s the only one that responded to me after last night&amp;rsquo;s frantic
pestering of everyone I could contact. She’s been my best friend for years.
She doesn&amp;rsquo;t know it, but I count the day that I met her among one of the few
moments of true happiness in my life. I remember that warm summer day fondly.
It seems a different reality from this dark, rainy, lonely place. I feel like
I spent days sitting in that playground, much too old to play, just talking
with her and hanging around doing nothing at all. I still feel like I can go
back to that moment sometimes, and it reminds me that this damn place is not
all that there is&amp;hellip; finally, a knock on the door!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was odd that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see her through the camera I hid between
the two soda machines. I figured that it was bad positioning, like when I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t see out the front door. I should have known. I should have known!
After the knock, I yelled through the door jokingly that I had a camera between
the soda machines, because I was embarrassed myself that I had taken this
paranoia so far. After I did that, I saw her image walk over to the camera
and look down at it. She smiled and waved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; she said to the camera brightly, giving it a wry look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It’s weird, I know,&amp;rdquo; I said into the mic attached to my computer. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve had
a weird few days.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Must have,&amp;rdquo; she replied. &amp;ldquo;Open the door, John.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hesitated. How could I be sure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, humor me a second here,&amp;rdquo; I told her through the mic. &amp;ldquo;Tell me one thing
about us. Just prove to me you’re you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gave the camera a weird look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Um, alright,&amp;rdquo; she said slowly, thinking. &amp;ldquo;We met randomly at a playground
when we were both way too old to be there?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed deeply as reality returned and fear faded. God, I&amp;rsquo;d been so
ridiculous. Of course it was Amy! That day wasn&amp;rsquo;t anywhere in the world except
in my memory. I’d never even mentioned it to anyone, not out of embarrassment,
but out of a strange secret nostalgia and a longing for those days to return.
If there was some unknown force at work trying to trick me, as I feared,
there was no way they could know about that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Haha, alright, I’ll explain everything,&amp;rdquo; I told her. &amp;ldquo;Be right there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran to my small bathroom and fixed my hair as best I could. I looked like
hell, but she would understand. Snickering at my own unbelievable behavior and
the mess I&amp;rsquo;d made of the place, I walked to the door. I put my hand on the
doorknob and gave the mess one last look. So ridiculous, I thought. My eyes
traced over the half-eaten food lying on the ground, the overflowing trash bin,
and the bed I’d tipped to the side looking for&amp;hellip; God knows what. I almost turned
to the door and opened it, but my eyes fell on one last thing: the old webcam,
the one I used for that eerily vacant chat with my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its silent black sphere lay haphazardly tossed to the side, its lens pointed
at the table where this journal lay. An overwhelming terror took me as I
realized that if something could see through that camera, it would have seen
what I just wrote about that day. I asked her for any one thing about us, and
she chose the only thing in the world that I thought they or it did not know&amp;hellip;
but IT DID! IT DID KNOW! IT COULD HAVE BEEN WATCHING ME THE WHOLE TIME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t open the door. I screamed. I screamed in uncontrollable terror. I
stomped on the old webcam on the floor. The door shook, and the doorknob tried
to turn, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear Amy&amp;rsquo;s voice through the door. Was the basement door,
made to keep out drafts, too thick? Or was Amy not outside? What could have
been trying to get in, if not her? What the hell is out there?! I saw her on
my computer through the camera outside, I heard her on the speakers through
the camera outside, but was it real?! How can I know?! She&amp;rsquo;s gone now&amp;mdash;I
screamed, and shouted for help! I piled up everything in my apartment against
the front door&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least I think that it&amp;rsquo;s Friday. I broke everything electronic. I smashed my
computer to pieces. Every single thing on there could have been accessed by
network access, or worse, altered. I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer, I know. Every little piece
of information I gave out since this started&amp;mdash;my name, my email, my
location&amp;mdash;none of it came back from outside until I gave it out. I&amp;rsquo;ve
been going over and over what I wrote. I&amp;rsquo;ve been pacing back and forth,
alternating between stark terror and overpowering disbelief. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m
absolutely certain some phantom entity is dead set on the simple goal of
getting me to go outside. Back to the beginning, with the phone call from Amy,
she was effectively asking me to open the door and go outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep running through it in my head. One point of view says I&amp;rsquo;ve acted like a
madman, and all of this is the extreme convergence of probability&amp;mdash;never going
outside at the right times by pure luck, never seeing another person by pure
chance, getting a random nonsense email from some computer virus at just the
right time. The other point of view says that extreme convergence of
probability is the reason that whatever’s out there hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten me already.
I keep thinking: I never opened the window on the third floor. I never opened
the front door, until that incredibly stupid stunt with the hidden camera after
which I ran straight to my room and slammed the door. I haven&amp;rsquo;t opened my own
solid door since I flung open the front door of the building. Whatever’s out
there&amp;mdash;if anything’s out there&amp;mdash;never made an ‘appearance’ in the building
before I opened the front door. Maybe the reason it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the building
already was that it was elsewhere getting everyone else… and then it waited,
until I betrayed my existence by trying to call Amy… a call which didn&amp;rsquo;t work,
until it called me and asked me my name…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terror literally overwhelms me every time I try to fit the pieces of this
nightmare together. That email&amp;mdash;short, cut off&amp;mdash;was it from someone trying
to get word out? Some friendly voice desperately trying to warn me before it
came? Seen with my own eyes, don’t trust them&amp;mdash;exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been so
suspicious of. It could have masterful control of all things electronic,
practicing its insidious deception to trick me into coming outside.
Why can’t it get in? It knocked on the door&amp;mdash;it must have some solid
presence&amp;hellip; the door&amp;hellip; the image of those doors in the upper hallway as
guardian monoliths flashes back in my mind every time I trace this path of
thoughts. If there is some phantom entity trying to get me to go outside,
maybe it can&amp;rsquo;t get through doors. I keep thinking back over all the books
I’ve read or movies I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, trying to generate some explanation for this.
Doors have always been such intense foci of human imagination, always seen as
wards or portals of special importance. Or perhaps the door is just too thick?
I know that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bash through any of the doors in this building, let
alone the heavy basement ones. Aside from that, the real question is, why
does it even want me? If it just wanted to kill me, it could do it any number
of ways, including just waiting until I starve to death. What if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t
want to kill me? What if it has some far more horrific fate in store for me?
God, what can I do to escape this nightmare?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A knock on the door…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told the people on the other side of the door I need a minute to think and
I&amp;rsquo;ll come out. I’m really just writing this down so I can figure out what to
do. At least this time I heard their voices. My paranoia&amp;mdash;and yes, I
recognize I’m being paranoid&amp;mdash;has me thinking of all sorts of ways that their
voices could be faked electronically. There could be nothing but speakers
outside, simulating human voices. Did it really take them three days to come
talk to me? Amy is supposedly out there, along with two policemen and a
psychiatrist. Maybe it took them three days to think of what to say to
me&amp;mdash;the psychiatrist&amp;rsquo;s claim could be pretty convincing, if I decided to
think this has all been a crazy misunderstanding, and not some entity
trying to trick me into opening the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychiatrist had an older voice, authoritarian but still caring. I
liked it. I&amp;rsquo;m desperate just to see someone with my own eyes! He said I have
something called cyber-psychosis, and I&amp;rsquo;m just one of a nationwide epidemic
of thousands of people having breakdowns triggered by a suggestive email that
&amp;lsquo;got through somehow.&amp;rsquo; I swear he said &amp;lsquo;got through somehow.&amp;rsquo; I think he means
spread throughout the country inexplicably, but I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly suspicious that
the entity slipped up and revealed something. He said I am part of a wave of
&amp;rsquo;emergent behavior&amp;rsquo;, that a lot of other people are having the same problem
with the same fears, even though we&amp;rsquo;ve never communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That neatly explains the strange email about eyes that I got. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get
the original triggering email. I got a descendant of it&amp;mdash;my friend could
have broken down too, and tried to warn everyone he knew against his paranoid
fears. That&amp;rsquo;s how the problem spreads, the psychiatrist claims. I could have
spread it, too, with my texts and instant messages online to everybody I know.
One of those people might be melting down right now, after being triggered by
something I sent them, something they might interpret any way that they want,
something like a text saying seen anyone face to face lately? The psychiatrist
told me that he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to &amp;rsquo;lose another one&amp;rsquo;, that people like me are
intelligent, and that&amp;rsquo;s our downfall. We draw connections so well that we
draw them even when they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there. He said it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get caught
up in paranoia in our fast paced world, a constantly changing place where more
and more of our interaction is simulated&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to give him one thing. It&amp;rsquo;s a great explanation. It neatly explains
everything. It perfectly explains everything, in fact. I have every reason
to shake off this nightmarish fear that some thing or consciousness or being
out there wants me to open the door so it can capture me for some horrible
fate worse than death. It would be foolish, after hearing that explanation,
to stay in here until I starve to death just to spite the entity that might
have got everyone else. It would be foolish to think that, after hearing that
explanation, I might be one of the last people left alive on an empty world,
hiding in my secure basement room, spiting some unthinkable deceptive entity
just by refusing to be captured. It’s a perfect explanation for every single
strange thing I&amp;rsquo;ve seen or heard, and I have every reason in the world to let
all of my fears go, and open the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly why I&amp;rsquo;m not going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I be sure?! How can I know what&amp;rsquo;s real and what&amp;rsquo;s deception? All of
these damn things with their wires and their signals that originate from some
unseen origin! They&amp;rsquo;re not real, I can’t be sure! Signals through a camera,
faked video, deceptive phone calls, emails! Even the television, lying broken
on the floor&amp;mdash;how can I possibly know it&amp;rsquo;s real? It&amp;rsquo;s just signals, waves,
light&amp;hellip; the door! It’s bashing on the door! It’s trying to get in! What insane
mechanical contrivance could it be using to simulate the sound of men
attacking the heavy wood so well?! At least I&amp;rsquo;ll finally see it with my own
eyes&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s nothing left in here for it to deceive me with, I&amp;rsquo;ve ripped
apart everything else! It can&amp;rsquo;t deceive my eyes, can it? Seen with your own
eyes don&amp;rsquo;t trust them they&amp;hellip; wait&amp;hellip; was that desperate message telling me to
trust my eyes, or warning me about my eyes too?! Oh my god, what&amp;rsquo;s the
difference between a camera and my eyes? They both turn light into
electrical signals&amp;mdash;they&amp;rsquo;re the same! I can&amp;rsquo;t be deceived! I have to be
sure! I have to be sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;date-unknown&#34;&gt;Date Unknown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I calmly asked for paper and a pen, day in and day out, until it finally gave
them to me. Not that it matters. What am I going to do? Poke my eyes out?
The bandages feel like part of me now. The pain is gone. I figure this
will be one of my last chances to write legibly, as, without my sight
to correct mistakes, my hands will slowly forget the motions involved.
This is a sort of self-indulgence, this writing… it’s a relic of another
time, because I’m certain everyone left in the world is dead&amp;hellip; or something
far worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit against the padded wall day in and day out. The entity brings me food and
water. It masks itself as a kind nurse, as an unsympathetic doctor. I think it
knows that my hearing has sharpened considerably now that I live in darkness.
It fakes conversations in the hallways, on the off chance that I might
overhear. One of the nurses talks about having a baby soon. One of the
doctors lost his wife in a car accident. None of it matters, none of it is
real. None of it gets to me, not like she does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the worst part, the part I almost can&amp;rsquo;t handle. The thing comes to me,
masquerading as Amy. Its recreation is perfect. It sounds exactly like Amy,
feels exactly like her. It even produces a reasonable facsimile of tears that
it makes me feel on its lifelike cheeks. When it first dragged me here, it
told me all the things I wanted to hear. It told me that she loved me,
that she had always loved me, that it didn&amp;rsquo;t understand why I did this,
that we could still have a life together, if only I would stop insisting
that I was being deceived. It wanted me to believe&amp;hellip; no, it needed me to
believe that she was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost fell for it. I really did. I doubted myself for the longest time.
In the end, though, it was all too perfect, too flawless, and too real.
The false Amy used to come every day, and then every week, and finally stopped
coming altogether&amp;hellip; but I don’t think the entity will give up. I think the
waiting game is just another one of its gambits. I will resist it for the
rest of my life, if I have to. I don’t know what happened to the rest of the
world, but I do know that this thing needs me to fall for its deceptions. If
it needs that, then maybe, just maybe, I am a thorn in its agenda. Maybe Amy
is still alive out there somewhere, kept alive only by my will to resist the
deceiver. I hold on to that hope, rocking back and forth in my cell to pass
the time. I will never give in. I will never break. I am&amp;hellip; a hero!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor read the paper the patient had scribbled on. It was barely
readable, written in the shaky script of one who could not see. He wanted
to smile at the man’s steadfast resolve, a reminder of the human will to
survive, but he knew that the patient was completely delusional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, a sane man would have fallen for the deception long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor wanted to smile. He wanted to whisper words of encouragement to
the delusional man. He wanted to scream, but the nerve filaments wrapped
around his head and into his eyes made him do otherwise. His body walked
into the cell like a puppet, and told the patient, once more, that he was
wrong, and that there was nobody trying to deceive him.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Rake</title>

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 2003, events in the northeastern United States involving a strange, human-like creature sparked brief local media interest before an apparent blackout was enacted. Little or no information was left intact, as most online and written accounts of the creature were mysteriously destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily focused in rural New York state and once found in Idaho, self proclaimed witnesses told stories of their encounters with a creature of unknown origin. Emotions ranged from extremely traumatic levels of fright and discomfort to an almost childlike sense of playfulness and curiosity. While their published versions are no longer on record, the memories remained powerful. Several of the involved parties began looking for answers that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2006, the collaboration had accumulated nearly two dozen documents dating between the 12th century and present day, spanning 4 continents. In almost all cases, the stories were identical. I’ve been in contact with a member of this group, and was able to get some excerpts from their upcoming book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-mariners-log-1691&#34;&gt;A Mariner&amp;rsquo;s Log: 1691&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He came to me in my sleep. From the foot of my bed, I felt a sensation. He took everything. We must return to England. We shall not come here again at the request of the Rake.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-journal-entry-translated-from-spanish-1880&#34;&gt;A Journal Entry (translated from Spanish): 1880&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have experienced the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. I see his eyes when I close mine. They are hollow. Black. They saw me and pierced me. His wet hand. I will not sleep. His voice (unintelligible text).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-suicide-note-1964&#34;&gt;A Suicide Note: 1964&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As I prepare to take my life, I feel it necessary to assuage any guilt or pain I have introduced through this act. It is not the fault of anyone other than him. For once, I awoke and felt his presence. And once, I awoke and saw his form. Once again, I awoke and heard his voice, and looked into his eyes. I cannot sleep without fear of what I might next awake to experience. I cannot ever wake. Goodbye.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found in the same wooden box were two empty envelopes addressed to William and Rose, and one loose personal letter with no envelope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dearest Linnie,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have prayed for you. He spoke your name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-a-witness-2006&#34;&gt;From a Witness: 2006&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Three years ago, I had just returned from a trip to Niagara Falls with my family for the 4th of July. We were all very exhausted after a long day of driving, so my husband and I put the kids straight to bed and called it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 4am, I woke up thinking my husband had gotten up to use the restroom. I used the moment to steal back the sheets, only to wake him in the process. I apologized and told him I thought he was out of bed. When he turned to face me, he gasped and pulled his feet up from the end of the bed so quickly, his knee almost knocked me out of the bed. He then grabbed me and said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting to the dark for a half second, I was able to see what caused the strange reaction. At the foot of the bed, sitting and facing away from us, was what appeared to be a naked man, or a large hairless dog of some sort. Its body position was disturbing and unnatural, as if it had been hit by a car or something. For some reason, I was not instantly frightened by it, but more concerned as to its condition. At this point, I was somewhat under the assumption that we were supposed to help him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband was peering over his arm and knee, tucked into the fetal position, occasionally glancing at me before returning to the creature. In a flurry of motion, it scrambled around the side of the bed, and then crawled quickly in a flailing sort of way right along the covers until it was less than a foot from my husband&amp;rsquo;s face. It was completely silent for about 30 seconds (probably closer to 5, but it seemed like a while), just looking at my husband. It then placed its hand on his knee and ran into the hallway, leading to the kids&amp;rsquo; rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I screamed and ran for the light switch, planning to stop this thing before it hurt my children. When I got to the hallway, the light from the bedroom was enough to see it crouching and hunched over about 20 feet away. It turned around and looked directly at me, covered in blood. I flipped the switch on the wall and saw my daughter, Clara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creature ran down the stairs as my husband and I rushed to help our daughter. She was very badly injured, and spoke only once more in her short life. She said, &amp;ldquo;he is the Rake&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband drove his car into a lake that night while rushing our daughter to the hospital. They did not survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a small town, news got around pretty quickly. The police were helpful at first, and the local newspaper took a lot of interest as well. However, the story was never published, and the local television news never followed up, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several months, my son Justin and I stayed in a hotel near my parent&amp;rsquo;s house. After we decided to return home, I began looking for answers myself. I eventually located a man in the next town over who had a similar story. We got in contact and talked about our experiences. He knew of two other people in New York who had seen the creature we now referred to as the Rake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took the four of us two solid years of hunting on the internet and writing letters to come up with a small collection of what we believe to be accounts of the Rake. None of them gave any details, history, or follow-up. One journal had an entry involving the creature in its first 3 pages, then never mentioned it again. A ship&amp;rsquo;s log explained nothing of the encounter, saying only that they were told to leave by the Rake. That was the last entry in the log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were, however, many instances where the creature&amp;rsquo;s visit was one of a series of visits with the same person. Multiple people also mentioned being spoken to, my daughter included. This led us to wonder if the Rake had visited any of us before our last encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up a digital recorder near my bed and left it running all night, every night, for two weeks. I would tediously scan through the sounds of me rolling around in my bed each day when I woke up. By the end of the second week, I was quite used to the occasional sound of sleep while blurring through the recording at 8 times the normal speed. It still took almost an hour every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the third week, I thought I heard something different. What I found was a shrill voice. It was the Rake. I can&amp;rsquo;t listen to it long enough to even begin to transcribe it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t let anyone listen to it yet. All I know is that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it before, and I now believe that it spoke when it was sitting in front of my husband. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember hearing anything at the time, but for some reason, the voice on the recorder immediately brings me back to that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thoughts that must have gone through my daughter&amp;rsquo;s head make me very upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not seen the Rake since he ruined my life, but I know that he has been in my room while I slept. I know and fear that one night I&amp;rsquo;ll wake up to see him staring at me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Does anyone remember this kid&amp;rsquo;s show? It was called Candle Cove and I must have been 6 or 7. I never found reference to it anywhere so I think it was on a local station between 1971 or 1972. I lived in Ironton at the time. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember which station, but I do remember it was on a at a weird time, like 4:00PM.&lt;/p&gt;

it seems really familiar to me&amp;hellip;.i grew up outside of ashland and was 9 yrs old in 72. candle cover&amp;hellip;was it about pirates? i remember a pirate marionete at the mouth of a cave talking to a little girl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
YES! Okay I&amp;rsquo;m not crazy! I remember Pirate Percy. I was always kind of scared of him. He looked like he was built from parts of others dolls, real low-budget. His head was an old porcelain baby doll, looked like an antique that didn&amp;rsquo;t belong on the body. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what station this was! I don&amp;rsquo;t think it was WTSF though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject Re: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sorry to ressurect this old thread but I know exactly what show you mean, Skyshale. I think Candle Cove ran for only a couple months in &amp;lsquo;71, not &amp;lsquo;72. I was 12 and I watched it a few times with my brother. It was channel 58, whatever station that was. My mom would let me switch to it after the news. Let me see what I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took place in Candle cove, and it was about a little girl who imagined herself to be friends with pirates. The pirate ship was called the Laughingstock, and Pirate Percy wasn&amp;rsquo;t a very good pirate because he got scared too easily. And there was calliope music constantly playing. Don&amp;rsquo;t remember the girl&amp;rsquo;s name. Janice or Jade or something. Think it was Janice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thank you Jaren!!! Memories flooded back when you mentioned the Laughingstock and channel 58. I remember the bow of the ship was a wooden smiling face, with the lower jaw submerged. It looked like it was swallowing the sea and it had that awful Ed Wynn voice and laugh. I especially remember how jarring it was when they switched from the wooden/plastic model, to the foam version of the head that talked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
ha ha i remember now too. do you remember this part skyshale: &amp;ldquo;you have&amp;hellip;to go&amp;hellip;INSIDE.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skyshale033&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ugh mike, I got a chill reading that. Yes, I remember. That&amp;rsquo;s what the ship always told Percy when there was a spooky place he had to go in, like a cave or a dark room where the treasure was. And the camera would push in on Laughingstock&amp;rsquo;s face with each pause. YOU HAVE&amp;hellip; TO GO&amp;hellip; INSIDE. With his two eyes askew and that flopping foam jaw and the fishing line that opened and closed it. Ugh. It just looked so cheap and awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You Guys remember the villain? He had a face that was just a handlebar mustache above really tall, narrow teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

That wasn&amp;rsquo;t the villain, the puppet with the mustache. That was the villain&amp;rsquo;s sidekick, Horace the Horrible. He had a monocle too, but it was on top of the mustache. I used to think that meant he had only one eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, the villain was another marionette. The Skin-Taker. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe what they let us watch back then.&lt;/p&gt;

Wasn&amp;rsquo;t his top hat and cloak all sewn up crazily? Was that supposed to be children&amp;rsquo;s skin??&lt;/p&gt;

yeah i think so. rememer his mouth didn&amp;rsquo;t open and close, his jaw just slid back and foth. i remember the little girl said &amp;ldquo;why does your mouth move like that&amp;rdquo; and the skin-taker didn&amp;rsquo;t look at the girl but at the camera and said &amp;ldquo;TO GRIND YOUR SKIN&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m so relieved that other people remember this terrible show!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have this awful memory, a bad dream I had where the opening jingle ended, the show faded in from black, and all the characters were there, but the camera was just cutting to each of their faces, and they were just screaming, and the puppets and marionettes were flailing spastically, and just all screaming, screaming. The girl was just moaning and crying like she had been through hours of this. I woke up many times from that nightmare. I used to wet the bed when I had it.&lt;/p&gt;

i don’t think that was a dream. i remember that. i remember that was an episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No no no, not possible. There was no plot or anything, I mean literally just standing in place crying and screaming for the whole show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject: Re: Candle Cove local kid&amp;rsquo;s show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
maybe i&amp;rsquo;m manufacturing the memory because you said that, but i swear to god i remember seeing what you described. they just screamed.&lt;/p&gt;

Oh God. Yes. The little girl, Janice, I remember seeing her shake. And the Skin-Taker screaming through his gnashing teeth, his jaw careening so wildly I thought it would come off its wire hinges. I turned it off and it was the last time I watched. I ran to tell my brother and we didn’t have the courage to turn it back on.&lt;/p&gt;

i visited my mom today at the nursing home. i asked her about when i was littel in the early 70s, when i was 8 or 9 and if she remebered a kid&amp;rsquo;s show, candle cove. she said she was suprised i could remember that and i asked why, and she said &amp;ldquo;because i used to think it was so strange that you said &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo;m gona go watch candle cove now mom&amp;rsquo; and then you would tune the tv to static and juts watch dead air for 30 minutes. you had a big imagination with your little pirate show.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian researchers in the late 1940s kept five people awake for fifteen days using an experimental gas-based stimulant. They were kept in a sealed environment to carefully monitor their oxygen intake so the gas didn&amp;rsquo;t kill them, since it was toxic in high concentrations. This was before closed circuit cameras, so they had only microphones and five-inch-thick glass porthole-sized windows into the chamber to monitor them. The chamber was stocked with books and cots to sleep on (but no bedding), as well as running water, a toilet, and enough dried food to last all five for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test subjects were political prisoners deemed enemies of the state during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was fine for the first five days; the subjects hardly complained, having been promised (falsely) that they would be freed if they submitted to the test and did not sleep for 30 days. Their conversations and activities were monitored, and it was noted that they continued to talk about increasingly traumatic incidents in their past. The general tone of their conversations took on a darker aspect after the four day mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five days, they started to complain about the circumstances and events that lead them to where they were and started to demonstrate severe paranoia. They stopped talking to each other and began alternately whispering into the microphones and one way mirrored portholes. Oddly, they all seemed to think they could win the trust of the experimenters by turning over their comrades, the other subjects in captivity with them. At first, the researchers suspected this was an effect of the gas itself&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nine days, the first of them started screaming. He ran the length of the chamber repeatedly, yelling at the top of his lungs for three hours straight, at which point he continued attempting to scream, but was only able to produce occasional squeaks. The researchers postulated that he had physically torn his vocal cords. The most surprising thing about this behavior was how the other captives reacted to it&amp;hellip; or rather, didn&amp;rsquo;t react to it. They continued whispering into the microphones until the second of the captives started to scream. The two non-screaming captives took the books apart, smeared page after page with their own feces, and pasted them calmly over the glass portholes. The screaming promptly stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did the whispering into the microphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three more days passed, the researchers checked the microphones hourly to make sure they were working, since they thought it impossible that no sound could be occurring with five people inside. The oxygen consumption in the chamber indicated that all five must still be alive. In fact, it was the amount of oxygen five people would consume at a very heavy level of strenuous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of the 14th day, the researchers did something they said they would not do to get a reaction from the captives; they used the intercom inside the chamber, hoping to provoke any response from the people they were afraid were either dead or vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They announced: &amp;ldquo;We are opening the chamber to test the microphones; step away from the door and lie flat on the floor or you will be shot. Compliance will earn one of you your immediate freedom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their surprise, they heard a calm voice respond in a single phrase: &amp;ldquo;We no longer want to be freed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debate broke out among the researchers and the military forces funding the research. Unable to provoke any more response using the intercom, it was finally decided to open the chamber at midnight on the fifteenth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chamber was flushed of the stimulant gas and filled with fresh air, and immediately, voices from the microphones began to object. 3 different voices began begging, as if pleading for the life of loved ones, to turn the gas back on. The chamber was opened and soldiers were sent in to retrieve the test subjects. They began to scream louder than ever, and so did the soldiers when they saw what was inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the five subjects were still alive, although no one could rightly call the state that any of them in &amp;rsquo;life.&amp;rsquo; The food rations past day five had not been so much as touched. There were chunks of meat from the dead test subject&amp;rsquo;s thighs and chest stuffed into the drain in the center of the chamber, blocking it and allowing four inches of water to accumulate on the floor. Precisely how much of the water on the floor was actually blood was never determined. All four &amp;lsquo;surviving&amp;rsquo; test subjects also had large portions of muscle and skin torn away from their bodies. The destruction of flesh and exposed bone on their finger tips indicated that the wounds were inflicted by hand, not with teeth as the researchers initially thought. Closer examination of the position and angles of the wounds indicated that most, if not all of them, were self-inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abdominal organs below the ribcage of all four test subjects had been removed. While the heart, lungs and diaphragm remained in place, the skin and most of the muscles attached to the ribs had been ripped off, exposing the lungs through the ribcage. All the blood vessels and organs remained intact, but had been taken out and laid on the floor, fanning out around the eviscerated but still living bodies of the subjects. The digestive tract of all four could be seen to be working, digesting food. It quickly became apparent that what they were digesting was their own flesh that they had ripped off and eaten over the course of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the soldiers were Russian special operatives at the facility, but still, many refused to return to the chamber to remove the test subjects. The subjects themselves continued to scream to be left in the chamber and begged and demanded that the gas be turned back on, lest they fall asleep&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone&amp;rsquo;s surprise, the test subjects put up a fierce fight in the process of being removed from the chamber. One of the Russian soldiers died from having his throat ripped out, and another was gravely injured by having his testicles ripped off and an artery in his leg severed by one of the subject&amp;rsquo;s teeth. Another five of the soldiers lost their lives, if you count the ones that committed suicide in the weeks following the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the struggle, one of the four living subjects had his spleen ruptured and bled out almost immediately. The medical researchers attempted to sedate him, but this proved impossible. He was injected with more than ten times the human dose of a morphine derivative and still fought like a cornered animal, breaking the ribs and arm of one doctor. His heart was seen to beat for a full two minutes after he had bled out, to the point there was more air in his vascular system than blood. Even after it stopped, he continued to scream and flail for another three minutes, struggling to attack anyone in reach and just repeating the word &amp;ldquo;MORE&amp;rdquo; over and over, weaker and weaker, until he finally fell silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surviving three test subjects were heavily restrained and moved to a medical facility, the two with intact vocal cords continuously begging for the gas, demanding to be kept awake&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most injured of the three was taken to the only surgical operating room that the facility had. In the process of preparing the subject to have his organs placed back within his body, it was found that he was effectively immune to the sedative they had given him to prepare him for the surgery. He fought furiously against his restraints when the anesthetic gas was brought out to put him under. He managed to tear most of the way through a four-inch-wide leather strap on one wrist, even through the weight of a 200 pound soldier holding that wrist. It took only a little more anesthetic than normal to put him under, and the instant his eyelids fluttered and closed, his heart stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the autopsy of the test subject that died on the operating table, it was found that his blood had triple the normal level of oxygen. The muscles that were still attached to his skeleton were badly torn, and he had broken 9 bones in his struggle to not be subdued. Most of them were from the force his own muscles had exerted on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second survivor had been the first of the group of five to start screaming. His vocal cords destroyed, he was unable to beg or object to surgery, and he only reacted by shaking his head violently in disapproval when the anesthetic gas was brought near him. He shook his head yes when someone suggested, reluctantly, that they should try the surgery without anesthetic, and did not react for the entire six hour procedure of replacing his abdominal organs and attempting to cover them with what remained of his skin. The surgeon presiding stated repeatedly that it should not be medically possible for the patient to still be alive. One terrified nurse assisting the surgery stated that she had seen the patients mouth curl into a smile several times, whenever his eyes met hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the surgery ended, the subject looked at the surgeon and began to wheeze loudly, attempting to talk while struggling. Assuming this must be something of drastic importance, the surgeon had a pen and pad fetched so the patient could write his message. It was simple. &amp;ldquo;Keep cutting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two test subjects were given the same surgery, both without anesthetic as well (although they had to be injected with a paralytic for the duration of the operation). The surgeon found it impossible to perform the operation while the patients laughed continuously. Once paralyzed, the subjects could only follow the attending researchers with their eyes. The paralytic cleared their system in an abnormally short period of time, and they were soon trying to escape their bonds. The moment they could speak, they were again asking for the stimulant gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tried asking why they had injured themselves, why they had ripped out their own guts, and why they wanted to be given the gas again. Only one response was given: &amp;ldquo;I must remain awake.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three subject&amp;rsquo;s restraints were reinforced and they were placed back into the chamber, awaiting determination as to what should be done with them. The researchers, facing the wrath of their military &amp;lsquo;benefactors&amp;rsquo; for having failed the stated goals of their project, considered euthanizing the surviving subjects. The commanding officer, an ex-KGB, instead saw potential, and wanted to see what would happen if they were put back on the gas. The researchers strongly objected, but were overruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for being sealed in the chamber again, the subjects were connected to an EEG monitor and had their restraints padded for long term confinement. To everyone&amp;rsquo;s surprise, all three stopped struggling the moment it was let slip that they were going back on the gas. It was obvious that, at this point, all three were putting up a great struggle to stay awake. One of the subjects that could speak was humming loudly and continuously; the mute subject was straining his legs against the leather bonds with all his might, first left, then right, then left again for something to focus on. The remaining subject was holding his head off his pillow and blinking rapidly. Having been the first to be wired to the EEG machine, most of the researchers were monitoring his brain waves in surprise. They were normal most of the time, but sometimes flatlined inexplicably. It looked as if he were repeatedly suffering brain death, before returning to normal. As they focused on paper scrolling out of the brainwave monitor, only one nurse saw the man&amp;rsquo;s eyes slip shut at the same moment his head hit the pillow. His brainwaves immediately changed to that of deep sleep, then flatlined for the last time as his heart simultaneously stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only remaining subject that could speak started screaming to be sealed in now. His brainwaves showed the same flatlines as the one who had just died from falling asleep. The commander gave the order to seal the chamber with both subjects inside, as well as three researchers. One of the named three immediately drew his gun and shot the commander point blank between the eyes, then turned the gun on the mute subject and blew his brains out as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed his gun at the remaining subject, still restrained to a bed as the remaining members of the medical and research team fled the room. &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t be locked in here with these things! Not with you!&amp;rdquo; he screamed at the man strapped to the table. &amp;ldquo;WHAT ARE YOU?&amp;rdquo; he demanded. &amp;ldquo;I must know!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you forgotten so easily?&amp;rdquo; the subject asked. &amp;ldquo;We are you. We are the madness that lurks within you all, begging to be free at every moment in your deepest animal mind. We are what you hide from in your beds every night. We are what you sedate into silence and paralysis when you go to the nocturnal haven where we cannot tread.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher paused, then aimed at the subject&amp;rsquo;s heart and fired. The EEG flatlined as the subject weakly choked out, &amp;ldquo;So&amp;hellip; nearly&amp;hellip; free&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
