<p>In 2023, I was a PhD student in biology and attended an ESA conference (mostly presenting some astrobiology related research results, nothing fancy or controversial). During a networking event, a US Navy officer who was attending the conference struck up a conversation with me. He seemed particularly interested in my research background and, after some small talk, casually suggested I apply for a military sponsored research project. He said they needed biologists for a study in the North Sea.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but as you might be able to guess, I&rsquo;ve always been a sucker for any suggestion of the supernatural or extraordinary. As a kid I&rsquo;d pour over Guinness World Record books until they fell apart at the spines, and I&rsquo;d watch Ghost Adventures like an addict, believing every minute of it. It&rsquo;s really interesting to think about what could possibly exist at the edge of our understanding, even if it means watching hours of Zak Bagans grasping at straws with a blinking music box. It&rsquo;s this fascination that led me to the discovery that I&rsquo;ll be sharing here shortly.</p>

<p>I was eighteen at the time. I&rsquo;d just graduated high school, and what was probably a really exciting and memorable time for most people was a stressful race against time for me. You see, my dad was very traditional; if I were going to be living in his house after high school, even just over the summer between graduation and college, I needed a job. If not, I was &ldquo;freeloading&rdquo;, and he swore with an adamance I certainly didn&rsquo;t care to test that I&rsquo;d be out on the street if I was unemployed for long. I&rsquo;d had months of preparation; hell, years, really. This entire time I could&rsquo;ve been looking; he certainly hadn&rsquo;t waited until now to clue me in on the terms of living with him after high school. But I just wasn&rsquo;t the type to care that much about anything until I was days from a deadline.</p>

<p>It was called Sleepy Pines Mall. A few miles off an interstate in America’s northeast, at the center of several small towns. It was a single story and only had two anchor stores, but it was sprawling considering its almost rural location. Built in 1973, it was one of the older shopping malls, and opened before there were long-term strategies on mall viability. Popular for a time, its occupancy dwindled in the late ’90s, and it lost its movie theater and Sears by 2003 before becoming a neglected, poorly maintained, and sometimes dangerous commercial plaza that was outdone by nearby rivals, and doomed by surrounding negative growth trends of the towns that kept it fed. The food court closed in 2006, and the last stores followed a year later. Sleepy Pines had its fans and grown adults who had gone there as children paying it nostalgic visits, as all malls do, but by 2010, it had become a mostly-forgotten derelict with a parking lot full of weeds.</p>

  <p>Author&rsquo;s Note: After some thought, and due to the highly sensitive nature of some of the topics in this story, I&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s appropriate to add a small disclaimer here. Not because I fear that people will be offended or even take this story seriously and actually hurt someone. Simply because we live in a society that shuns creative minds when they dip into the unsettling side of fiction.</p>

<p>What is it with guys and dick pics?  They just can&rsquo;t resist sending them.  You don&rsquo;t even have to ask most of the time.  It&rsquo;s as if the human male has always had this innate urge to share images of his own cock with unwitting females, and was just waiting for technology to catch up.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m complaining.  This pride men have for their own junk suits me just fine.  In fact, I love it.  It&rsquo;s fun for me.  There&rsquo;s always a jolt of excitement when my phone beeps and a dick pic sprawls across my screen.  Hell, I ask for them in many cases, and these fuckboys are always happy to oblige.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you a secret. But first, you have to promise me you won&rsquo;t laugh. This is still an uncomfortable subject for me, so I&rsquo;d appreciate your understanding. Do we have a deal?</p>
<p>When I was five years old, I watched a movie no child should ever see. I don&rsquo;t remember much about the circumstances of my viewing other than that it was at the house where my family lived, late at night, in the dark with only the television providing light. The film was an animated feature, and depicted themes of animal cruelty, death, and dismemberment. The scenes were surreal and terrifying and left a deep impression on me.</p>

<p>At the edge of our town, there&rsquo;s a shitty gas station that&rsquo;s open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. If you were to go inside, you&rsquo;d see row after row of off-brand chips, cookies, potted meats and ramen. Expiration dates suspiciously missing from canned goods like they were filed off years ago in some misguided attempt to control inventory turnover. A faded &ldquo;wet floor&rdquo; sign from way back covering a crack in the foundation by the cooler that has since turned into a pothole. The pothole, a collection point for sticky spill-off, has become a miniature tar pit collecting countless insect corpses and the occasional small rodent.</p>
