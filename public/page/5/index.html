<p>Every area in all parts of the world has those area-specific urban legends that just refuse to die. Whether the stories are about a haunted asylum on the outskirts of the city, a creature that lives in the nearby woods, or a ghost that haunts a lonely stretch of road outside of town, there is always a common thread within the tales; no one has ever been to these places, seen the creatures, or witnessed any hauntings with their own eyes.</p>

<p>I work at a gas station in rural Pennsylvania. It&rsquo;s a boring job, but it&rsquo;s pretty easy and it pays all right. A few weeks ago, this new guy started; I&rsquo;ll call him Jeremy.</p>
<p>Jeremy is weird. He&rsquo;s about 25 or 26, and he hardly speaks, but he&rsquo;s got the creepiest laugh I&rsquo;ve ever heard. My boss and I have both noticed this, but it&rsquo;s never been a problem, so there&rsquo;s not much we can do about it. Customers have never complained about him, and he&rsquo;s always done his job fairly well. Up until a few weeks ago, anyway&mdash;that&rsquo;s when things started going missing. Employee theft can be a problem at any business that sells consumer goods, and there&rsquo;s only one person working at a time at this gas station (it&rsquo;s a pretty small place). About two weeks ago, my boss started noticing that we were short on motor oil. At first, it was a few containers at a time, then entire shelves and boxes from the back room. Pretty soon entire shipments would be gone the day after we got them, and it would always be right after Jeremy&rsquo;s shifts. My boss has checked the security camera tapes from every single night he worked, but he could never catch him in the act. Jeremy would lock up at closing, then the motor oil would be gone the next day.</p>

<p>About five years ago, I lived downtown in a major city in the US. I&rsquo;ve always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep. To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking.</p>
<p>I spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid. I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite. But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening.</p>

<p>When Marissa said, &ldquo;Maybe we should see other people,&rdquo; Nicholas decided to give her cancer.</p>
<p>Nicholas, like many geniuses, had his great obsession. The root of his monomania wasn&rsquo;t hard to trace. After all, he&rsquo;d lost both his parents to cancer by the age of thirteen. He bore mute witness as they wasted away, leaking mucilaginous fluids onto crisp white hospital sheets. Colon cancer (father) and lung cancer (mother) had followed in quick succession.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that if you surf the web long enough, you’ll see some pretty sick
shit. This is especially true if you intentionally dwell into the dark underbelly
of the internet. I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few things I don&rsquo;t care to admit to, but one
thing that I’ll always remember is a site called &ldquo;normalpornfornormalpeople.com&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first strange thing about the site was that I didn&rsquo;t find it by actually
looking for it. It was e-mailed to me by someone I didn&rsquo;t know. The e-mail was as
follows:</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Midnight Game&rdquo; is an old Pagan ritual, typically performed as punishment for those who had broken the laws of the Pagan religion in question. While it was also used as a scare tactic to not disobey the gods, there is still a very existent chance of death to those who play the Midnight Game. There is an even higher chance of permanent mental scarring. It is highly recommended that you DO NOT PLAY THE MIDNIGHT GAME.</p>

</figure><p>In the fall of 1987, local news channel WSB-TV 2 of Atlanta, Georgia was attempting to fill a scheduling gap in their Sunday morning line-up. After a few solicitations by local business owners, they decided to allow the young Reverend Marly Sachs to take the available hour block to do a religiously themed show. It premiered October 18th with little promotion.</p>
<p>The show was standard religious fare and consisted of the reverend sitting in a simple chair reading passages from the Bible to the camera and discussing their interpretation and significance to our modern, day-to-day life. The show received a reasonable number of viewers and continued to be shown into early December.</p>

<p>It had been three weeks since I heard any word from David. In the six months since we started dating we had only gone three days without talking, and that was after a pretty intense fight. There was nothing out of the ordinary when I had talked to him last, he had just mentioned that he was going to check something out a friend told him about. But then I got a really weird text the night before. It was from David, but it wasn&rsquo;t from his number. It only had five words in it:</p>

<p>The Nazi reign was famous for its backdoor scientists and occult researchers. Special expeditionary divisions of the Reich were often sent out in search of artifacts, or locations of occult or religious significance. Meanwhile, in Germany, bunkers were assembled and mansions and castles were fitted with labyrinths and dungeons, which were filled with strange experiments and research notes.</p>
<p>Whenever the Allies found these places, they were often gutted, burned, or otherwise destroyed and abandoned. If a lab was found intact, the research was usually incoherent or missing, and would be later destroyed by the Allies to prevent the Nazis from recovering any data left behind. Thus, a lot of Nazi experiments were kept under the radar.</p>

<p>Of course nobody believes in snuff films. They&rsquo;re just too sick to be real, right? Nobody in their right mind would actively produce evidence against themselves like that, let alone make money off of it.</p>
<p>Al Goldstein, publisher of Screw magazine, has a standing offer of one million American dollars for anyone who can find a real, commercially sold snuff movie. The offer has been in place for years and nobody has claimed it. And for good reason. I mean, you don&rsquo;t buy a carton of cigarettes and then sell it for half or a third of the price, do you?</p>
