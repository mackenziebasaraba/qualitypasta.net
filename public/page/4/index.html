<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve written anything related to the Disney Corporation, and I&rsquo;m sure you can understand why.</p>
<p>A lot has been going on since my last post. I&rsquo;ve received a lot of questions and concerns from folks who read my first-hand account of Mowgli&rsquo;s Palace… a resort that was built and abandoned by Disney.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone who mirrored by post. It&rsquo;s been taken down from a few places, mostly corporate sites that were easily leaned on by a larger power. However, for every nuked topic or disappearing blog post, it seems like a hundred more have popped up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pray, for devils have no reason<br>
Satan waits to curse your ways<br>
Have you seen it in his eyes in the sunset?<br>
Have you wondered if he&rsquo;s laughing when he plays?<br></p></blockquote>
<cite>&ndash;Kansas, &ldquo;The Devil Game&rdquo;</cite>

<p>This is a set of instructions for how to speak with the Devil.</p>
<p>Which, as those of you with any sort of brains at all might note, is a patently moronic proposition on the face of it; one likely to culminate in any number of thoroughly unpleasant fates. Honestly, it would probably be smarter to publish your credit card number on Facebook, or take up a career in crocodile-wrestling.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t sleep with my window open anymore. No matter how hot outside it gets, that bastard stays closed. It&rsquo;s been this way for a long time. Since I was very young. It&rsquo;s not a real hit with the ladies during summertime. People usually recommend air conditioners, and I usually go with the prospect when I have company. But when it&rsquo;s in, I don&rsquo;t sleep well at all because I can only imagine how easy it would be for anyone to bypass them.</p>

<p>The streets, roads and dusty lanes of Colombia have been fertile territory for myths and legends since before the arrival of the Spaniards. Tales of ‘La Patasola&rsquo;, a one-legged wailing banshee that forever sought her child, and of ‘El Duende&rsquo;, a backwards-footed goblin that led travelers to their doom, nibbled at the corners of journeymen&rsquo;s ease for centuries. Although these stories mainly troubled those living in or passing through rural areas, the growth of cities brought with it a new breed of urban legend rooted in the primal distrust we still harbor, somewhere deep inside, of modern technology. An example of this is the phantom bus that allegedly roams the city&rsquo;s streets at night. Supposedly, young women who board it alone are found mutilated in overgrown outlying fields a few days later, a frozen look of abject terror illustrating the moment of their last, tormented breath.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of the Ronald McDonald House charity. They provide housing
for the families of sick kids when they&rsquo;re in the hospital. Seems pretty
innocent, right?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s another side to the charity. There&rsquo;s another type of Ronald
McDonald House, one that not many people know about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one in most big cities. You won&rsquo;t find it by looking for it. It doesn&rsquo;t
have an address. It doesn&rsquo;t have a sign above the door. It doesn&rsquo;t even have
windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to bed and wait for the Sandman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as it came out of James&rsquo;s mouth it seemed to him a strange thing to say, and he was not sure why he had, but for some reason it worked: Daniel went to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, though, he asked: &ldquo;What does the Sandman look like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My friend Mark and I love exploring abandonments. We&rsquo;ve been doing it for years, and I&rsquo;m telling you, it never gets old. The constant creepy feeling, finding new areas, guessing at the history - it&rsquo;s almost addicting.</p>
<p>From the first time we did it, we were hooked. Still, you can only explore houses for so long before you have to move on to something bigger, and that&rsquo;s what led us to what happened last year.</p>

<p>Melinda hated driving at night. She did her best to avoid it. Short trips to the store if she just realized she ran out of tampons or had nothing for dinner after getting home — that sort of thing happened now and then. But she did her best not to go out after dark unless someone was coming to pick her up.</p>
<p>So, naturally, she found herself on the longest drive of her life tonight, with no moon, few stars, swirling clouds above her, and acres of forest on either side.</p>

<p>Some of you may have heard that the Disney corporation is responsible for at least one real, &ldquo;live&rdquo; Ghost Town.</p>
<p>Disney built the &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; resort in Baker&rsquo;s Bay in the Bahamas. It didn&rsquo;t START as a ghost town! Disney&rsquo;s cruise ships would actually stop at the resort and leave tourists there to relax in luxury.</p>
<p>This is a FACT. Look it up.</p>
<p>Disney blew $30,000,000 on the place… yes, Thirty Million Dollars.</p>
