<p>Does anyone remember an old PC game from the early 1990s called <em>&ldquo;Mr. Mix&rdquo;?</em> It was mainly a typing game, similar to Mario Teaches Typing, where you have to put words into a box to make a chef (the titular Mr. Mix) place ingredients into a bowl.</p>

<p>This is long, so I apologize for that. I&rsquo;ve never had to tell this story with enough detail to actually explain it all the way, but it is true and it happened when I was about six years old.</p>
<p>In a quiet room, if you press your ear against a pillow, you can hear your heartbeat. As a kid, the muffled, rhythmic beats sounded like soft footsteps on a carpeted floor, so as a kid, almost every night&mdash;just as I was about to drift off to sleep&mdash;I would hear these footsteps and I would be ripped back to consciousness, terrified.</p>

<p>In the last decade and a half, it&rsquo;s become infinitely easier to obtain exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for by way of a couple of keystrokes. The Internet has made it all too simple to use a computer to change reality. An abundance of information is merely a search engine away, to the point where it&rsquo;s hard to imagine life as any different.</p>
<p>Yet, a generation ago, when the words &lsquo;streaming&rsquo; and &rsquo;torrent&rsquo; were meaningless save for conversations about water, people met face-to-face to conduct software swap parties, trading games and applications on Sharpie-labeled, five-and-a-quarter inch floppies.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that Peter Terry was addicted to heroin.</p>
<p>We were friends in college and continued to be after I graduated. Notice that I said &ldquo;I&rdquo;. He dropped out after two years of barely cutting it. After I moved out of the dorms and into a small apartment, I didn&rsquo;t see Peter as much. We would talk online every now and then (AIM was king in pre-Facebook years). There was a period where he wasn&rsquo;t online for about five weeks straight. I wasn&rsquo;t worried. He was a pretty notorious flake and drug addict, so I assumed he just stopped caring.</p>

<p>Last week, I drove to a nearby town. The place was surrounded by tall hills and mountains. You could have a very pleasant hike down any of the numerous trails there.</p>
<p>I was climbing one trail when I saw what looked like a silver box. When I approached it, I noticed it was a digital camera!</p>
<p>It was a 3.3 megapixel Powershot S20! Slightly scuffed, but otherwise fine. It rained the next day, so I was really lucky to get there when I did. When I got home, I saw that it had a 300 megabyte hard drive inside. This must be about a £250 value, folks; I pity the fool who dropped it so carelessly.</p>

<p>My sister had a teddy bear, a scary teddy bear. I do not know why, but it creeped me out. It was just so disturbing to me. The thing had eyes that looked so real. It was as if it was made from a real bear, and its face was just blank and unsettling.</p>
<p>I started to get weird feelings about the bear when my sister first got it-—-she was only a baby at the time, and I was about four. We had a dog, you see, and he had a habit of eating things, so my mother always had to put it up on the small cabinet in the corner of the hallway upstairs. Every time I went up those stairs, I saw that creepy bear suddenly glare around the corner at me, as if it was watching me. This wasn&rsquo;t the weird part; it started to get really strange about five years later, at the age of six or seven. My sister had lost interest in the bear, so my mother just threw it in the old toy cupboard. The only problem was that the cupboard was in <em>my</em> room.</p>

</figure><p>If you ever find yourself in LA&rsquo;s Old China town, head into the square. Go past the statue of Sun Yat-sen, past the hip-ultramod toy store called &ldquo;Munky King&rdquo; and look for an import store next to what used to be a wishing fountain. Go into this store and head all the way to the back, and you&rsquo;ll see a selection of weapons. Look for a weapon called a Jiujiebian, a sort of multi-sectioned whip. It MUST have exactly nine segments, no more, no less. This will be called the &ldquo;chain of night&rdquo;. As of now, there are 48 notches in its handle. It will cost you 29.95.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m writing this down on paper and not on my computer. I guess
I&rsquo;ve just noticed some odd things. It&rsquo;s not that I don’t trust the computer&hellip; I
just&hellip; need to organize my thoughts. I need to get down all the details somewhere
objective, somewhere I know that what I write can’t be deleted or&hellip; changed&hellip;
not that that&rsquo;s happened. It’s just&hellip; everything blurs together here, and the
fog of memory lends a strange cast to things&hellip;</p>

<p>During the summer of 2003, events in the northeastern United States involving a strange, human-like creature sparked brief local media interest before an apparent blackout was enacted. Little or no information was left intact, as most online and written accounts of the creature were mysteriously destroyed.</p>
<p>Primarily focused in rural New York state and once found in Idaho, self proclaimed witnesses told stories of their encounters with a creature of unknown origin. Emotions ranged from extremely traumatic levels of fright and discomfort to an almost childlike sense of playfulness and curiosity. While their published versions are no longer on record, the memories remained powerful. Several of the involved parties began looking for answers that year.</p>
