<p>It was a desolate stretch of road across the wide, open expanse of empty desert. The most remarkable thing about this part of the highway was a single gnarled tree stripped bare of its leaves, branches reaching up like bony fingers into the clear night sky on the side of the road.</p>
<p>I flicked the ash off my cigarette out of the car window, the embers danced like miniature stars in the dark before winking out of existence behind us. Soft classical music poured from the car’s speakers and I took another drag from my cigarette. It was about 4 A.M. and we were determined to get to Arroyo Hondo by dinner time.</p>

<p>Seventy years of life, I&rsquo;d thought I&rsquo;d seen everything. Turns out, no matter how long &lsquo;ya get in the tooth, life can still throw you for a loop. My name&rsquo;s Dale, and I&rsquo;ve got one hell of a tall tale for you.</p>
<p>In the middle of every month, me and a couple of hunting buddies head out into the woods to bag some varmints. &lsquo;Ya can&rsquo;t hunt deer out of season, but nobody cares if a few squirrels get fragged. The hunting party consists of me, my buddy Jim from West Virgina. He&rsquo;s a nice guy, but about as sharp as a turnip. There&rsquo;s Hank, he&rsquo;s so big he could lift me over his head with one hand. There&rsquo;s Jack, who&rsquo;s such a nice guy you wouldn&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s been in prison twice, and lastly there&rsquo;s Buddy. That ain&rsquo;t his real name, its actually &ldquo;Dale.&rdquo; But my name is Dale, hence the nickname, &ldquo;Buddy.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s a shut-in and kind of a weirdo, but the sweetest guy you&rsquo;ll ever meet. He owns a couple pet rats.</p>

<p>I woke up in a birthing sac. Panicked and choking on amniotic fluid, I clawed at the fleshy walls, fighting with all my terrified strength to free myself. With a wet, ripping sound, I was dumped onto the muddy cobbles of the street below, twisting my ankle as I landed.</p>
<p>Cold rain blasted my naked body clean of the sac&rsquo;s liquid, I tried and failed to get to my feet. The street was alien to me, an insane medley of architecture ranging from the modern to the prehistoric. The sky above boiled with storm clouds, illuminating my surroundings with non-stop flashes of lightning.</p>

<p>The story you are about to read is one that has been, for the last 70 years, left to wither in the hearts of those few who recall it. Of the twelve of us present that day, only I remain, and my own end is rapidly approaching. I write this tale with shaky hand solely in order to console myself in my final moments, and I hope anyone who may discover this document will refrain from judgement upon me or my comrades until the end.</p>

<p>When I was a little kid, the two things I loved most in life were Godzilla, and
NES games. So naturally when <em>Godzilla: Monster of Monsters</em> came out, it was like
a dream come true. Well, almost. To sum it up, most of the game revolved around
getting through (very repetitive) outer space levels while smashing up tanks and
jets, and then fighting against Godzilla&rsquo;s monster enemies. Overall it was pretty
mediocre, but back then I didn&rsquo;t care. When I got the game as a present for my
tenth birthday, I played it night and day, as much as I could.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure where else to post these stories, so I figured I&rsquo;d share them here. I&rsquo;ve been an SAR officer for a few years now, and along the way, I&rsquo;ve seen some things that I think you guys will be interested in.</p>
<p>I have a pretty good track record for finding missing people. Most of the time they just wander off the path, or slip down a small cliff and can&rsquo;t find their way back. The majority of them have heard the old &lsquo;stay where you are&rsquo; thing, and they don&rsquo;t wander far. But I&rsquo;ve had two cases where that didn&rsquo;t happen. Both bother me a lot, and I use them as motivation to search even harder on the missing persons cases I get called on.</p>

</figure><p>I had a weird dream last night. It wasn’t like your normal everyday dream. It was very disturbing to me. I wouldn’t consider it a nightmare, but I know I will never forget it. It still brings a shiver just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Before the dream, everything was normal. Saturday had arrived after a long, tiring week of work. I was an IT technician. It was the kind of job where we would assist customers, varying from software issues to networking ones. Occasionally, the job would require us to meet them on their turf to provide onsite service. Unfortunately for me, I wore multiple hats which meant I had to tackle most onsite visits. Some would think of me as a versatile, irreplaceable employee, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong. I, however, couldn&rsquo;t look past the glaring fact that the company was just being too cheap to hire others, opting to milk every ounce they could get from us, their understaffed employees.</p>

<p>It was late, right around 8:00 P.M. For November this meant that the shadows of the night were already engulfing the world. It wasn&rsquo;t cold out though. The wind was gentle and carried with it the smells of foliage thanks to the various gardens that littered the campus grounds.</p>
<p>I sauntered along the sidewalks while admiring the weather. I loved the night, especially when the stars were out. Unfortunately they couldn&rsquo;t be seen from here even on the clearest of nights since the college was located just outside the city.</p>

<p>David stumbled to his car in a daze. The last couple of hours were a complete blur. Haunting images would sporadically cross over his mind, slowly reminding him of the hell he was now leaving behind. He felt in his pocket for his phone and dialed 911. There was no way he could explain any of this, but for some reason his first reaction was to call&mdash;maybe they could just come here and confirm that it&rsquo;s a normal house, nothing more. They could put his mind at ease and he could go home, live a normal life with&mdash;</p>

<p>My parents died in a car crash when I was fourteen.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel bad for me or anything. I&rsquo;ve made my peace with that years ago. Life with them was never great, but I do miss them. It&rsquo;s just that if they taught me one thing, it&rsquo;s to not sit around wallowing in self-pity.</p>
<p>I just wish they hadn&rsquo;t sent me to live with my Aunt Louise.</p>
<p>Anyone have that one family member that&rsquo;s just a little strange, a little cut off from the rest of the family? Aunt Louise was ours. She was also our closest living relative. Dad&rsquo;s family lived on the other side of the continent. Mom&rsquo;s parents were both dead and she was an only child. Aunt Louise, her mother&rsquo;s sister actually, so my great-aunt, lived just an hour from where we did.</p>
