<p>Blog author: <strong>Reed Murdock</strong></p>
<h3 id="october-16th-2014">October 16th, 2014</h3>
<p>Hey guys, so I&rsquo;ve decided to start a blog about my new life. Most of you reading this are probably my friends and acquaintances, but for the rest of you, I&rsquo;ll expose a little bit about myself. My name&rsquo;s Reed. I just moved out of my stupid parents&rsquo; basement (thank God) and now I&rsquo;m pursuing my own life where no one can push me around anymore. Technically I&rsquo;m the one who ditched the place, but they all but kicked me out beforehand. Nobody gives a damn about a &ldquo;crackhead&rdquo; like me, not even my parents. Not that I care.</p>

<p>Before I get into this, I need to make something clear.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t happening right now. I&rsquo;m not going to beg for advice or help, because I&rsquo;m beyond any of your help. I&rsquo;ve had to give up everything in my life that ever mattered. This happened more than 9 years ago, and I&rsquo;m finally taking the risk to share it. World events are seriously scaring me, and I have more&hellip;personal reasons that I can get into later.</p>

<p><em>On the 25th March, at 14:57GMT, the world stopped for 27 minutes and 54 seconds. No one noticed at first. Those that eventually did were ordered to keep quiet.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There was no sudden jolt, no collapsing into unconsciousness, no transition into utter darkness and back again. Nothing.</p>
<p>For everyone, time had appeared to pass as normal, one second moving uneventfully into the next. Birds flew, people talked, the wind and the rain blew and fell respectively - nothing had occurred to indicate that anything untoward or unexpected had happened to the inhabitants of the Earth. Only those who looked beyond our planet and its ring of constantly chattering satellites now found that the rest of the universe told a different story.</p>

<p>BREE, DON&rsquo;T DELETE THIS!</p>
<p>I know you hate me, but we were best friends once and I need you to read this. I think I&rsquo;m in serious trouble and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do, but I need you to read this so that you understand.</p>
<p>I know we haven&rsquo;t talked since sectionals. It&rsquo;s been forever, but what happened to you wasn&rsquo;t my fault. At least, it wasn&rsquo;t entirely my fault. I know everyone thinks it was, but I would never do anything to hurt you.</p>

<p>My girlfriend Emily died on August 7th of 2012.</p>
<p>I just received another message, and it&rsquo;s worse than the others. She was involved in a three car crash driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She was dead within minutes at the scene.</p>
<p>We had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn&rsquo;t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would&rsquo;ve married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was always happy when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.</p>

<p>I loved horrifying images.</p>
<p>Pictures that could make one feel uneasy or even utterly terrified fascinated and delighted me. Yet for all of my appreciation and exposure, they worked their charms exceptionally well on me. I had trouble falling asleep most nights with the visions of these nightmarish things invading my mind and leaving it a smoldering wreck. From horror games to Internet screamers to the illustrations of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, I had a host of things in my head to keep me up at night. I was enthralled and terrified by nearly all of them.</p>

<p>There is a legend circulating around the television industry about Channel ∞.</p>
<p>Channel ∞ is hard to get to, and reports vary as to what it actually is. I will tell you how to get there and then what to do.</p>
<p>Acquire a television, preferably analogue for the best experience, and the older the better. Acquire a remote control. It does not have to go with the television you&rsquo;re using. Turn on the TV and set it to a channel that is static, or just a plain black screen if you are using a digital TV. Basically any channel you do not receive.</p>

</figure><p>Just a few miles outside of my town stood an old country house. It had been converted into a daycare, where parents would drop off their kids in the morning and pick them up in the evening. However, said daycare had been out of business for a few years now. There was a sign posted in the front yard just a few feet from the house that read &ldquo;Happy Sun Daycare&rdquo;, with a cute-looking cartoony sun painted on it. Within the fenced-off backyard stood playground equipment that had fallen into disrepair and began to rust. A slide, a couple of swing-sets, some monkey-bars, and a merry-go-round were once covered by swarms of children as they ran and played in the outdoors. They had since become perches for the local birds and squirrels, and were swarmed by ants rather than children.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never been too fond of anyone at my local school. They were all a little rude and boring for me. You see, I grew up in a small area with not many people interested in art like I am, so I had to venture off from home. I found myself attending a pretty rural art college. It&rsquo;s sorta like a normal university, except it&rsquo;s full of big-headed people.</p>
<p>The only reason I&rsquo;m here is because I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be an illustrator, a kid&rsquo;s book designer of sorts. I&rsquo;d had a keen interest in children&rsquo;s media and classic books such as the <em>Arthur</em> series, so when I was sent to live at this college, I was taken aback when I realised a lot of the other students here were all &ldquo;fine artists&rdquo;. You know the kind; the ones who like to splatter paint onto a canvas and claim it&rsquo;s art. I&rsquo;m not really big on that sorta thing, but I didn&rsquo;t question it.</p>

<p>The world we live in is full of things we don&rsquo;t understand. Being the curious humans that we are, we naturally try and seek these things out. Doing so has led us to remarkable discoveries and inventions that we never could have imagined a hundred years ago. We have defeated disease, built to the sky itself and even created machines that could take us beyond the clouds and into the stars. If our ancestors could see us and what we have created, I&rsquo;m sure many of them would see us as gods.</p>
