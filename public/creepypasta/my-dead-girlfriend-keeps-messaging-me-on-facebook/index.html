<p>My girlfriend Emily died on August 7th of 2012.</p>
<p>I just received another message, and it&rsquo;s worse than the others. She was involved in a three car crash driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She was dead within minutes at the scene.</p>
<p>We had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn&rsquo;t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would&rsquo;ve married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was always happy when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.</p>
<p>That being said, she wasn&rsquo;t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, &ldquo;If I kark it first, don&rsquo;t just say good things about me. I&rsquo;ve never liked that. If you don&rsquo;t pay me out, you&rsquo;re doing me a disservice. I&rsquo;ve got so many flaws, and that&rsquo;s just another part of me.&rdquo; So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee.</p>
<p>I know, that&rsquo;s tangential, but I don&rsquo;t feel right without you having an idea of what she was like. Em had been dead for approaching 13 months when she first messaged me.</p>

</figure><p>This is when it began. I had left Emily&rsquo;s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her pictures. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialize it. I &lsquo;share&rsquo; access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of three minutes on the account (or total on a computer). After a little confusion, I thought it was her.</p>

</figure><p>I had received conformation from Susan that she hadn&rsquo;t been on Em&rsquo;s profile since the week of her death. Em knew a lot of people, so I thought it was one of her tech savvy friends fucking with me in the worst possible way.</p>

<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure><p>Around February 2014, Emily started tagging herself in my photos. I would get notifications for them, but they&rsquo;d normally be removed by the time I got to the picture. The first time I actually caught one, it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. &lsquo;She&rsquo; would tag herself in spaces where it was plausible for her to be, or where she&rsquo;d usually hang out. I&rsquo;ve got screenshots of two (from April and June; these are the only ones I&rsquo;ve been able to catch, so they&rsquo;re a little out of the timeline I&rsquo;m trying to write out.)</p>
<p>Around this time, I began to lose sleep. I was too angry to sleep.</p>
<p>She would tag herself in random photos every couple of weeks. The friends who noticed it thought it was some fucked up bug; I found out recently that there have been friends who have noticed and didn&rsquo;t say anything about it. Some of them even removed me from their Facebook friends list.</p>
<p>At this point, you may be wondering &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just kill your Facebook profile?&rsquo; I almost wish I did. I did for a little while. On days when I can&rsquo;t get out there, it&rsquo;s nice to have friends to chat with. It&rsquo;s nice visiting Em&rsquo;s page when the little green dot isn&rsquo;t next to her name. I was already socially reclusive when Em was alive; her death turned me into something pretty close to a hermit, and Facebook and MMOs were (are) my only real social outlets.</p>

<p>On March 25th, I got an &lsquo;answer&rsquo;.</p>

</figure><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until a few months after going through these chats that I discovered that she was recycling my own words as well.</p>
<p>My response seems kinda lackluster here. I was intentionally providing her/him with emotional &lsquo;bait&rsquo; (&lsquo;This is actually devastating&rsquo;) to keep them interested in their game; I was working off the assumption that the kind of person who would do this is the kind of person that thrives of off the distress of others. I was posting in tech forums, trying to find a way to find this person, contacting Facebook. I needed to keep them around to gather &rsquo;evidence&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I had even changed the password and security details several times.</p>
<p><strong>April 16, 2014</strong></p>
<p>I received this:</p>

</figure><p>I hadn&rsquo;t discovered any leads. Facebook had told me the locations her page had been accessed from, but since her death, they&rsquo;re all places I can account for (my house, my work, her mum&rsquo;s house, etc.). </p>
<p>My response here wasn&rsquo;t bait. &ldquo;yo ask Nathan&rdquo; was an inside joke that&rsquo;s too lame worth explaining, but seeing &lsquo;her&rsquo; say it again was absolutely fucking crippling. My reaction in real life was much less prettier.</p>
<p>Her last few messages have started to scare me, but I wouldn&rsquo;t admit until this point.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even have words for this&hellip;</p>

</figure><p>&lsquo;FRE EZIN G&rsquo; is the first original word she&rsquo;s(?) said. This has given me nightmares that just won&rsquo;t end. I keep dreaming that she&rsquo;s in an ice cold car, frozen, blue and grey. I&rsquo;m standing outside the car door in the warmth screaming for her to come out. She doesn&rsquo;t even realize I&rsquo;m there. Sometimes her legs are outside with me.</p>

</figure><p>I wasn&rsquo;t really drunk. Em wasn&rsquo;t an affectionate girl, and it always embarrassed her to exchange &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;s, cuddle, talk about how much we meant to each other. She was more comfortable with it when I was drunk. I pretended to be drunk a LOT.</p>
<p>Her reply is what prompted me to finally memorialize her page, thinking it might put an end to this. It might seem innocuous to her previous message - it&rsquo;s from an old conversation where I was trying to convince her to let me drive her home from a friend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In the collision, the dashboard crushed her. She was severed in a diagonal line from her right hip to midway down her left thigh. One of her legs was found tucked under the backseat.</p>

</figure><p>These are the messages I sent her the day she died. She was usually home by 4:30. This, alongside a couple voicemails, is the last time I talked to her under the assumption that she was still alive. You&rsquo;ll see why I&rsquo;m showing you these soon.</p>
<p><strong>July 1, 2014</strong></p>
<p>I got these messages yesterday:</p>

<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure><p>I memorialized her page a few days after the message about walking. Until today, she&rsquo;d been quiet; she hadn&rsquo;t even been tagging herself in my photos.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do anymore. Do I kill her profile? What if it is her? I feel like I wanna puke. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I just got a notification, I heard the alert sound. I&rsquo;m just too afraid to swap windows and check it.</p>
<p>I checked the alert. I heard it as I was compiling all this together. This was the message..</p>

<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure><p>That&rsquo;s my door&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my computer&hellip;</p>
<p>I got the message three hours ago, but I didn&rsquo;t want to check it until now&hellip;</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m legitimately scared. I have no idea who took this photo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on my tablet in my garage. Zen for now. Going to drive to friend&rsquo;s. Forgot to open the garage door in my panic so building up the nerve to get out to do that now.</p>
