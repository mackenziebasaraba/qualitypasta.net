Everybody knows that if you surf the web long enough, you’ll see some pretty sick
shit. This is especially true if you intentionally dwell into the dark underbelly
of the internet. I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few things I don&rsquo;t care to admit to, but one
thing that I’ll always remember is a site called &ldquo;normalpornfornormalpeople.com&rdquo;.
The first strange thing about the site was that I didn&rsquo;t find it by actually
looking for it. It was e-mailed to me by someone I didn&rsquo;t know. The e-mail was as

<p>Everybody knows that if you surf the web long enough, you’ll see some pretty sick
shit. This is especially true if you intentionally dwell into the dark underbelly
of the internet. I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few things I don&rsquo;t care to admit to, but one
thing that I’ll always remember is a site called &ldquo;normalpornfornormalpeople.com&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first strange thing about the site was that I didn&rsquo;t find it by actually
looking for it. It was e-mailed to me by someone I didn&rsquo;t know. The e-mail was as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hi there</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>found this site is very nice thought u might like</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>normalpornfornormalpeople.com</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>pass it on, for the good of mankind&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Pretty standard issue chain letter, although the url and the last remark really
piqued my curiosity. I was having a very boring day when I got this, so I made
sure my anti-virus was working and then I clicked on it.</p>
<p>It was a very average, very generic looking site. It gave the impression that the
creators just BARELY gave a shit about making it look professional. The author
seemed to have a very tenuous grasp on English, and on the front page was a long,
boring, and incoherent rant that I don’t remember or have saved.</p>
<p>The site had a strange tagline (which even today people haven&rsquo;t figured out the
meaning of), which was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Normal Porn for Normal People, A Website Dedicated To The Eradication of Abnormal
Sexuality&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>And from the sound of that, I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether I was here to watch porn or if
I had stumbled onto some kind of eugenics program. But I was here now, and I was
very, very curious to see what &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo; get their rocks off to. So I
scrolled down through the rant and&hellip; nothing. The page didn&rsquo;t seem to link to
anywhere else, and I was about to leave when I noticed every word of the rant was
its own hyperlink.</p>
<p>So I clicked one of them, and was sent to a white page with very long list of
links in the form of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;normalpornfornormalpeople.com/(random letters)&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>So I stopped for a minute and asked myself if I really wanted to waste God knows
how much time clicking random links that will likely give me a virus that will
rape my computer. I figured I&rsquo;d just try it for maybe five minutes, just to see
if anything came up. I clicked one of the links, and was sent to another page.
This page apparently had totally different urls than the last one.</p>
<p>I was just about to say &ldquo;Fuck this&rdquo; when I clicked on the third link, and a video
download came up. It was called &ldquo;peanut.avi&rdquo;. It was a thirty-minute video of a man,
a woman and a dog in a kitchen. The woman would make a peanut butter sandwich, and
the man would set it down for the dog to eat. This was all that happened, for
thirty minutes. It was obvious that the cameraman had to stop filming and wait
until the dog was ready to eat again, and the dog seemed rather sick by the end of
it.</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: &ldquo;What the hell does that have to do with porn?&rdquo; I have
no clue. I&rsquo;ve seen a little over two dozen videos from this site, and the
majority had no sexual activity at all.</p>
<p>After watching peanut.avi, I went on a certain image board I frequent to play
online show and tell, like I always do with weird shit like this. But someone had
already made a thread about it, some guy who had received the same chain letter I
did. The image board thread got lots of people with nothing better to do to dig
through the site, and that&rsquo;s how I saw other videos.</p>
<p>Most of those two dozen videos were very uneventful, and consisted of people
talking to the cameraman in a room with nothing in it but a desk and a few chairs.
I mean literally nothing on the walls, or in terms of furniture. The whole room
had a very cold, sterile feel to it.</p>
<p>The conversations were just idle banter about previous jobs or embarrassing
childhood moments. I kept expecting some kind of discussion about what the people
were filming or what the site was about, but of course, nothing. You would never
know these videos had anything to do with porn if you saw it out of context. I
will say one thing though, the people who appeared in these videos were quite
attractive.</p>
<p>However, the other videos that actually did feature content which I suppose could
be called &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; is where things got weird.</p>
<p>I’ll give brief descriptions of the stranger videos; if you&rsquo;re really eaten up
with curiosity you can try to hunt them down on a torrent site.</p>
<dl>
<dt>lickedclean.avi</dt>
<dd>
<p>A ten-minute video filmed by a hidden camera in which we see a repairman working
on a washing machine for the first two minutes. When it&rsquo;s fixed, the repairman
talks to the owner briefly, and then leaves. The owner checks to make sure the
repairman is gone, and he begins to lick all over the top of the washing machine.
This goes on for seven minutes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>jimbo.avi</dt>
<dd>
<p>A five-minute video of an obese mime performing his act. It was actually pretty
funny, particularly one part where he pretends to pull up a chair, then pretends
that it breaks because of his weight. In the last thirty seconds of the video,
the camera cuts to static briefly and cuts back to the man sobbing quietly, still
wearing mime outfit and makeup. Some kind of obscure fetish?</p>
</dd>
<dt>dianna.avi</dt>
<dd>
<p>Four-minute video in which the camerman talks to a woman in a room different from
the &ldquo;interview room&rdquo;. This room looks like one you’d find in a normal person&rsquo;s
house. Exactly where they are is never specified, as Dianna only talks about her
violin playing. She obviously plays her violin, but she keeps getting distracted
by something.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t notice this until someone on the image board thread pointed it out, but
if you look at the mirror in the background, you can see a fat man in a chicken
mask masturbating.</p>
</dd>
<dt>jessica.avi</dt>
<dd>
<p>Another four-minute cameraman video. This time he&rsquo;s outside a house, talking to
another young woman. They talk about canoe rides. The camera zooms out to reveal
the city streets behind them occasionally.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The strange thing is: No one so far has been able to identify where this street
is. Guesses have ranged everywhere from Europe to Australia to the Philippines,
but there&rsquo;s yet to be a match for the street shown in the video.</p>
</dd>
<dt>tonguetied.avi</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ten-minute video. The first five minutes consist of an elderly woman making out
with a mannequin. The video cuts out like it did in jimbo.avi halfway through,
and the scene is now a group of mannequins huddled together in a circle around
the camera. The lights have been dimmed, and the elderly woman is nowhere to be
seen. From this point on, there is no sound.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stumps.avi</dt>
<dd>
<p>Five-minute-long video where a man with no legs is attempting to breakdance on a
DDR mat in what looks like the kitchen from peanut.avi, but much dirtier. There&rsquo;s
a radio playing music unseen in the background, but it stops at the four minute
mark when the man collapses on the mat in exhaustion.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>He breathes heavily and pleads with someone off-screen to let him rest. This
off-screen person becomes terrifyingly enraged and yells at him to keep dancing,
which he does. You can hear this off-screen person begin to scream as the video
ends abruptly.</p>
</dd>
<dt>privacy.avi</dt>
<dd>
<p>The woman from dianna.avi is masturbating on a mattress in the &ldquo;interview room&rdquo;,
while the man from stumps.avi walks around on his hands while wearing some kind
of goblin mask.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The door in this room was always closed in other videos, but it&rsquo;s now open. In
this video the only light is in the room, and the hallway is dark. Near the end
of the video, you can see an animal quickly run through the hallway.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>And finally, the last video we uncovered:</p>
</dd>
<dt>useless.avi</dt>
<dd>
<p>Angry chimpanzee</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>In this eighteen-minute video, a blonde woman from one of the previous interview
videos is tied down to a mattress in the interview room. She attempts to scream
but her mouth is taped over. After seven minutes, a man in a black suit and mask
opens the door, but he does not enter.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>He holds the door open for the animal that was running in the hall in the previous
video. It&rsquo;s revealed to be an adult chimpanzee, its hair shaved and its entire body
painted red. It seemed to be starved and abused, with several wounds along its
shoulders and back.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>When the chimp enters the room, the masked man closes the door behind it. The
chimpanzee sniffs the air for a moment (it may have been blind), and notices the
woman tied to the mattress. It goes into a frenzy, and begins to maul her.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The assault goes on for a grueling seven minutes, until the woman finally dies.
The chimp eats flesh from her corpse for four minutes as the video ends.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The thread exploded with activity after this video was uncovered, and people
discussed it long into the night. When I came back to the image board the next
day I found that the thread was deleted. I tried to start another one, and they
banned me. I tried e-mailing the guy who sent me the chain letter with the site&rsquo;s
url, sent him five messages and never got a response.</p>
<p>I have tried to discuss this website on various places, and I got banned
frequently. The site itself was also deleted about three days after
useless.avi was uncovered, likely because someone contacted the authorities about
it.</p>
<p>The only proof that normalpornfornormalpeople.com ever existed was a few
screencaps people took, and videos from the site that people saved and uploaded
on torrents. The most popular of which being useless.avi, which found its way
onto a few gore sites.</p>
<p>Wherever you upload them to, all of the videos from normalpornfornormalpeople.com
get deleted after a while.</p>
