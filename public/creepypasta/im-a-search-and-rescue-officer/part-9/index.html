<p>It&rsquo;s been a while, hasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I know everyone says it but time has this really strange way of flowing when you&rsquo;re an adult. I guess I&rsquo;m at that age where I&rsquo;m in between being a kid and getting old. Or maybe that&rsquo;s your entire life. In between things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s summer now, which means we&rsquo;re dealing with a massive influx of people in the parks. We&rsquo;re an incredibly popular camping destination because of our large amount of camp sites in various scenic areas, and in the summer season these camps are almost always operating at almost to full capacity at any given time. We&rsquo;re well staffed, and we all of us know what to look for, what to expect. We have teams standing by in the event of any kind of emergency.</p>
<p>Even so, people still manage to slip away.</p>
<p>in response to a couple of other incidents at the same site, we installed a camper near the entrance, and a Ranger stays out there every night. We rotate, so everyone spends one night a week there. I chose Wednesdays, as these tend to be relatively low-key, with only our long-term guys around. This particular day had been humid, like the inside of a locked car. All of us were relatively miserable, but the camper had a small AC unit, and the campers and I took turns sitting in it until the sun went down. We all bedded down, and I had the AC turned up as high as it would go. It&rsquo;s a loud unit, so I had earplugs in. The camper is tiny but comfortable and I fell asleep relatively quickly.</p>
<p>I woke up in total silence and it took me a minute to realize that that was the problem. The AC had stopped, and there was absolutely no sound outside. I sat up and the sheets didn&rsquo;t make any noise. I clapped. Nothing. I yelled. Nothing.</p>
<p>This has happened to me before. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that it&rsquo;s some kind of strange acoustical phenomenon, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s caused by the wind. I got out of bed and yanked on my boots and flew out the door. I ran to the edge of the campsite, about 500 feet away, and somewhere behind the trees there was something darker than the space around it. I headed for it, but I must have misjudged its distance because it took longer to get there than it should have.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d split a tree in half. I&rsquo;ve seen lightning do that a few times but not this cleanly. This cut was surgical. The bushes underneath it had been crushed, and I could faintly make out the shape of something furry. A raccoon, I suspected. The intestines bursting out of its eye sockets were already attracting flies.</p>
<p>The stairs were concrete, old. I could make out the lines of graffiti on the lower steps. A metal handrail bowed out haphazardly, most of the supports bent or gone. Ten, maybe twelve steps. In a rush the sound of the world came back and I heard the faint electrical snap of a fly exploding near my ear. I sprinted back to camp. I grabbed the rifle out of the pickup I&rsquo;d taken to the site and stood at the edge of camp, my back to the woods. I stood there and watched until the sun came up. I watched the whole camp, every tent. I know I never fell asleep, and no one came into or out of camp, so I really don&rsquo;t know how the woman got away. Her tent was in my direct line of site. As best I can guess, she must have gotten out when I was turned away for a second. They&rsquo;re hopeful that she&rsquo;s still alive, of course, but I think we&rsquo;ll have to close that part of the park for a while. Officially, we&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on things. But I wouldn&rsquo;t take much comfort in that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re keeping an eye on a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of messages about the length and quality of this post. I&rsquo;m sorry, guys, I know it&rsquo;s not as detailed or as long as my past updates. I wrote it in the middle of the night after getting home from an emergency at the park, which I&rsquo;ll discuss later. I needed to vent a bit, I guess. Perhaps I should have waited to write all this down when my mind, and my memory, were a bit clearer. I&rsquo;ll do my best to make the next update a little more interesting.</p>
