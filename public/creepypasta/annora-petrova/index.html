I know you hate me, but we were best friends once and I need you to read this. I think I&rsquo;m in serious trouble and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do, but I need you to read this so that you understand.
I know we haven&rsquo;t talked since sectionals. It&rsquo;s been forever, but what happened to you wasn&rsquo;t my fault. At least, it wasn&rsquo;t entirely my fault. I know everyone thinks it was, but I would never do anything to hurt you.">

<p>BREE, DON&rsquo;T DELETE THIS!</p>
<p>I know you hate me, but we were best friends once and I need you to read this. I think I&rsquo;m in serious trouble and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do, but I need you to read this so that you understand.</p>
<p>I know we haven&rsquo;t talked since sectionals. It&rsquo;s been forever, but what happened to you wasn&rsquo;t my fault. At least, it wasn&rsquo;t entirely my fault. I know everyone thinks it was, but I would never do anything to hurt you.</p>
<p>This is going to sound crazy, but I need to tell you so that someone knows.</p>
<p>It started when we were in the 8th grade. It was the night before the Crystal Classic competition. I was at home and couldn&rsquo;t sleep because I was so nervous about competing.</p>
<p>Well, I got on the computer, just sorta surfing the web and stuff, but I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate on anything. I was just sitting there. So I googled myself.</p>
<p>I never should have done that, Bree. At first, it was just all the usual stuff you find when you Google yourself; then I found a link to a Wikipedia page about me.</p>
<p>I thought our club or my dad made it or something. There wasn&rsquo;t much there - just some basic facts about skating and what city I lived in, but the thing that got me was that it said I had won that year&rsquo;s Crystal Classic.</p>
<p>I laughed. I thought for sure someone had only made it to encourage me. I confronted my dad about it, but he denied it.</p>
<p>When I won the competition the next day, I was so happy. That was the first competition I had ever won and it felt so good. Remember how hard I worked after that? That was when my parents hired Sergei to coach me. You know how much that must have cost.</p>
<p>After that, I would check my page before every competition, and it would always say where I placed. It said I would win the regionals at 15 and that came true. Afterwards, Sergei convinced my mom and dad that I had a real shot at the Olympics. That was when they pulled me from school.</p>
<p>I skated every day, but I just wasn&rsquo;t progressing the way Sergei said I needed to if I wanted a shot at the Championship. I was working so hard and skating well, but still Sergei said it wasn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>When the sectionals came, all I could think about was winning, so I did something I shouldn&rsquo;t have. Everyone was saying that you were the favorite and I felt like I had already lost the competition, so I made a Wikipedia account and tried to update my page to say that I was the winner.</p>
<p>The thing is that after I tried to update the page, I checked it, and all it said was: &ldquo;Annora Petrova is a selfish little bitch who is going to get what she deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I broke down. That&rsquo;s why I looked so awful the next day. I was in a daze. I remember watching your routine and seeing your blade snap. The next thing I knew, I was on the ground and my face was covered in blood from where the tip flew off and sliced my forehead. Then they told me it was my fault because I had your skates in my possession earlier.</p>
<p>Bree, I honestly didn&rsquo;t do anything to your skates. I wanted to win, but I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to hurt you.</p>
<p>When they told me I was banned from any further competitions, everyone said that I got what I deserved. Nobody even asked for my side of the story. I guess you heard that Sergei dropped me after that, too. He said that I ruined him.</p>
<p>No one would talk to me. Do you know what it&rsquo;s like to be ostracized by everyone? I couldn&rsquo;t even get ice time. And then the page got worse. Anytime I&rsquo;d check it, it would say all these horrible things about me. I can&rsquo;t even tell you half of them, the language was so vile. I&rsquo;d cry every time I read it, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop checking it. I knew I had to do something, so I made a complaint to Wikipedia. I even tried calling them, but no one there claimed to know anything about the page.</p>
<p>I was home alone that Friday night when I decided to check it to see if it had been taken down. The page was still there, only this time it said: &ldquo;Annora Petrova is a pathetic little orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I freaked. I kept calling my parents to warn them, but every time I did, all I would hear was this horrible laughter on the other end. I must have called them a hundred times until I couldn&rsquo;t take the sound of the laughing anymore.</p>
<p>After the accident, the police gave me their phones, and there wasn&rsquo;t any record of my calls that night.</p>
<p>I was devastated. Before that, I was so busy training all day and doing home school, I never realized just how alone I had been the whole time. I know you tried to reach out, but I was so depressed and angry that I just shut everything out.</p>
<p>Once I turned 18 and got the settlement money from the court, I came to Switzerland. I got to reinvent myself. My skating really took off. It hasn&rsquo;t even been a year and I still feel like everything that happened was so long ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it, Bree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing you now from an old hotel outside of Prague. I&rsquo;m auditioning for the Ice Circus tomorrow. I know it&rsquo;s the kind of thing we used to make fun of, but I really want this.</p>
<p>I was feeling really nervous, so out of an old habit, I checked my page. It&rsquo;s so hard to say this, but when I read it to see if I&rsquo;d get the job tomorrow, all it said was, &ldquo;Annora Petrova died friendless and alone&rdquo;, and it has today&rsquo;s date listed as the date of my death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sobbing so hard, I can barely type this. But I wanted you to know the truth. Please believe me, Bree. I attached a screenshot of the page. It&rsquo;s all there, just as I told you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I don&rsquo;t know anyone here and nobody speaks English. I keep refreshing the page.</p>
<p>God, it&rsquo;s been forever, I keep refreshing but it still hasn&rsquo;t changed, I&rsquo;m waiting for midnight. I don&rsquo;t know what to do, so I locked myself in my room. There&rsquo;s only a few minutes to midnight now. All I can do is refresh the page. I&rsquo;m exhausted, but I can&rsquo;t stop. I&rsquo;m afraid to leave the computer until I know what happens next.</p>
