The shit story of my hunt for ancient germanic spirit
(featuring my bad english)

    
Be me
living in a small vilage on the border of Germany and The Neatherlands
testing mu new night vision cam for school project
wolfs are turning back to The Neatherlands trough Germany
its been all over the fucking news
Found a nice tree in the woods near a hill called Tankenberg
looking for a money shot
instal my sweet new cam, hook the baby up to a nice tree
come back next day to look at pictures
nothing but birds and small deer
Just spend fucking €400 to spy on birds
feelsbad.jpg
repeat this for a week or two
more birds, deer and Some hogs to
send all pictures to a friend/project partner from school for further review












    
next day
got home from a family dinner at some spanish restourant
turn on pc
three Emails from friend
two of them are about some Rare birds
in the last mail he urges me to look at some picture i took a week ago
open op folder
open pic and see what apears to be a feral ghoul from falout 4 riding a hog












    
holyfuck.jpg
almost tear of my fucking balls as i whas scretch them at the moment
lose my shit a bit
i call friend
dont know what to do
go to police?
no, what are they gonna do, look for a doctor seuss caracter riding a pig
dont think so





    
next day
at school
talk to friend about pic
to afraid to show pic to anyone
they might think i lost my mind or something
ask him &ldquo;did you show the pic to anyone anon?&rdquo;
anon: &ldquo;yeah man my parents and my uncle&rdquo;
anon: &ldquo;They think its prety funny&rdquo;
weekend
go back home
show pic to my mother
she says its a weird picture like the ones on the Discovery Channel
says grampa used to tell storys about a man riding a hog
thats-really-specific.jpg





    
next day
go to see Gramps
he pours me a drink as always
Korenbrandewijn or Gin as you guys in Trumptopia call it
my family is feuling my alcoholism
gonna die before i turn thirty for sure
ask him about a guy riding a hog
at first he is clueless about what iam talking about
he remembers and smiles
he told me about a spirit called &ldquo;Derk met den beer&rdquo; (Derk with a Hog)
says he is a protector of these woods and something about a old farmer beaing cursed for shooting a rivle at God on &ldquo;Kerst Nacht&rdquo; (Christmas Eve)
he goes to the bookshelf to get an older leathery looking book with gold ornaments idk how to discribe it in english
&ldquo;Overijssels sagenboek&rdquo; whas the titel on the cover
a book with stories about local legends like dwarfs, water monsters and witches
under the Chapter &ldquo;Wilde jacht&rdquo;(Wild hunt), i found multiple stories about Derk met den beer
some about the cursed farmer, and one about him being a god from like pagan times
some real viking shit












    
i say to my grandpa, &ldquo;Thats a weird name for a god &ldquo;Derk&rdquo;
he smiles
thats not his real name anon, you cant speak his real name it will bring bad luck
whats he called i sayd Voldemort i said smiling
even just seeing the wild hunt is a bad omen
my grandma hears my grandpa talking about the spirit
she looks at us and says &ldquo;wasnt he called Fro or Friej or something?&rdquo;
in one fleuent motion my grandpa jumps out of his chair and begins to raise his voice
&ldquo;You dont speak his name!&rdquo;
&ldquo;What did i tell just now!&rdquo;
ofuck.jpg
didnt know my grandpa whas this superstitious
after he calms down i showed him the picture i took of the thing in the woods
my grandpa is silent
&ldquo;he even has the spear&rdquo; he mumbles after a minnute
&ldquo;what?&rdquo;
i take a closer look and you can almost make out a spear behind the figure
&ldquo;he misses a war horn&rdquo; said grandpa
&ldquo;a horn?&rdquo; i said
he turns the page of the book and on it a real nice looking picture of a Germanic looking dude riding a hog
he is blowing a horn
&ldquo;what does the horn do?&rdquo; i ask
get some vague awnser, someting along the lines of &ldquo;It helps him hunt&rdquo;





    
couple of days later
back home i do some Research on Derk/Fro
turns out he whas like an old germanic god, elmost every germanic country has its own name for him
in The Netherlands and Germany they call him Fro or Frey
and in the Scandinavian countrys they called him Freyr
god of fertility
yeah the dude indeed looks like a real ladys man
reading some information on the Tankenberg were i took the pictures
there is a small pagan temple
temple for some goddess named Tamfana
a temple for human sacrifice possibly
go to the temple just for the heck of it












    
not much to see just a small reconstruction of an temple and a nice view of the forest
encounter some locals that live near the temple
ask em about Tamfana
they proudly tell about the goddess of hervest and nature
i ask the man about Derk
he told me that every Christmas Eve they round up all their shit and bring it inside their home
becouse if you dont have your stuff together ar midnight Derk will come and wreck your shit
mabey even you
i ask &ldquo;are there people who have seen Fro?&rdquo;
the man looks at me like i fucked his wive
&ldquo;Never say that name&rdquo; he said
i laugh and said &ldquo;what will he do steal your broom?&rdquo;
the guy said again &ldquo;Never say that name&rdquo;
he walks off
weirdest interaction i ever had





    
A week passes and some dude on local news says that he had seen a man on a hog
thats it must be
try to contact the man but no response
next day
got his adres
ride to his house
nobody home
return home, this looks like a dead end
three days later turns out the guy comitted suicide
shit is getting to real now
thats what you get for looking funny at someone i guess
deside to go to police and show them our man fro
man walks in gives me the most discusting cup of coffee i ever had
they take some more info from me like the location and date the pic was taken
return home
cant sleep thinking of our boy fro
4 in the morning loud knoking on our door
some fucking goons from the government or police i dont know
they seize all my fucking equipment my camara and the new camara i just baught specialy for Derk
my phone and my laptop
some thicc looking guy with thin comb over asks if i have more pictures on that hard drive
no
they take it anyway
there was some porn on there as well
i know
just the regular stuff dont worry
luckely i backedup all pics on my google drive
hackerman.gif





    
grandpa passed away
grandma said he wasnt doing so well lately
i begin to get paranoid, think its because of the Derk thing
think the government is hiding something
bought some new cameras
curently haning in the forest around Tankenberg
strugeling with my study will become a dropout soon
opsesively watching my cameras for a sign of Derk, just to prove that its out there
